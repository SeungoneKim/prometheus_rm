Both candidates give the same single numerical answer, 31.  
The problem asks for an age in years, and both candidates supply the identical integer value, with no unit ambiguity.  
Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for two numerical answers:

1. Initial area.
2. Doubling time (in hours).

Candidate 1:
1. 1/27 cm²
2. 2.52 h  (rounded to two decimals)

Candidate 2:
1. 1/27 cm²
2. 4 · ln(2)/ln(3) h

Step-by-step comparison:

• Sub-answer 1: Both give 1/27 cm² → identical.

• Sub-answer 2:  
  – Evaluate Candidate 2’s exact expression:  
    4 · ln(2)/ln(3) ≈ 2.523719 h.  
  – Candidate 1 gives 2.52 h.  

  According to Rule 4 we must compare values to 6 significant digits.  
  Candidate 1 → 2.52000  
  Candidate 2 → 2.52372  

  These differ at the 3rd decimal place, so the two numbers are not equal to 6 significant digits.

Because one of the required sub-answers differs, the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The numerical value of Candidate 1 is

2 / (0.3)³ · (0.7)⁴ / 4!  ≈ 0.740216 .

Candidate 2 gives 0.741 (interpreted as 0.741000 to 6 significant digits).

Comparing to six significant digits: 0.740216 ≠ 0.741000.

Hence the two answers are not the same.

The question asks for all solutions of the system.  

• Candidate 1 supplies an infinite family of solutions indexed by any integer k.  
• Candidate 2 supplies only the single solution that corresponds to k = 0 in candidate 1’s family.

Because candidate 1 contains additional valid solutions that candidate 2 omits, the two answers are not the same.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give the required four answers, and their formulae and exact values match.  
However, their numerical approximations differ:

• Area at t = 3 h  
 – Candidate 1: 95.03317777 → 95.033178 (6 sig. fig.)  
 – Candidate 2: 95.03 → 95.030000 (6 sig. fig.)  
 Values differ at the 3rd decimal place.

• Circumference at t = 3 h  
 – Candidate 1: 34.55751919 → 34.557519 (6 sig. fig.)  
 – Candidate 2: 34.56 → 34.560000 (6 sig. fig.)  
 Values differ at the 3rd decimal place.

Per Rule 4, numerical answers must match to six significant digits; these do not. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates indicate “None,” but:

• Candidate 1 lists two separate answers (“child: None, adult: None”).  
• Candidate 2 gives a single answer (“None”).

Because the question’s special instruction treats “None” as a single answer, the number of answers differs between the candidates. Under Rule 2, mismatched answer counts make them inequivalent.

Both candidates provide antiderivatives for the same indefinite integral.  
Numerical checks at several points (e.g., x = 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.5) show

 F₂(x) – F₁(x) ≈ 1.20919958 … (constant, independent of x).

Because indefinite integrals are defined only up to an arbitrary additive constant, the two expressions differ only by such a constant and therefore represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers give an antiderivative expressed as a constant multiple of an arctangent.  
Let  

S = √(−x² + 10x − 24).

Candidate 1: I₁(x) = −(2/√3) arctan[ S /(√3(x−4)) ] + C₁.

Candidate 2: I₂(x) =  (2/√3) arctan[ (2x−9+S)/(√3(1+S)) ] + C₂.

Define  

A = arctan[ S /(√3(x−4)) ],  
B = arctan[ (2x−9+S)/(√3(1+S)) ].

One checks (using the tangent‐addition formula or simple numerical tests) that for every x in the domain 4 < x < 6,

B + A = π/3.

Hence
I₂(x) − I₁(x) = (2/√3)(B + A) = (2/√3)(π/3) = constant.

Because indefinite integrals are determined only up to an additive constant, the two antiderivatives are mathematically equivalent.

Therefore the two candidates provide the same result (up to an integration constant).

The two candidates give exactly the same formulas for the velocity and acceleration, but their interval statements differ:

• For “slowing down”,  
  – Candidate 1:  (0, 1) ∪ (√3, ∞)  
  – Candidate 2:  [0, 1) ∪ (√3, ∞)  

Thus Candidate 2 includes the single point t = 0 while Candidate 1 does not. Because the question asks for the precise time intervals and the two sets are not identical, the answers are not the same according to Rule 2 (every sub-answer must match exactly).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give the same expressions for velocity and acceleration, so their answers to sub-problem 1 are equivalent.

For sub-problem 2 they differ:

• Candidate 1  
  – Speeding up: (1, √3)  
  – Slowing down: (0, 1) ∪ (√3, ∞)

• Candidate 2  
  – Speeding up: (−∞, −√3) ∪ (−1, 0) ∪ (1, √3)  
  – Slowing down: (−√3, −1) ∪ (0, 1) ∪ (√3, ∞)

Candidate 2 includes additional negative-time intervals that Candidate 1 omits. Unless the problem explicitly restricts time to t ≥ 0 (which it does not), Candidate 1’s list is incomplete. Because the two candidates do not give identical interval sets for sub-problem 2, their overall answers are not the same (Rule 2 and Rule 3).

The answers are single numerical values.

Convert each to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 5.06577778 → 5.06578  
• Candidate 2: 5.0658 → 5.06580

Comparing 5.06578 with 5.06580, they differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits.  
Rule 4 specifies that two real numbers must match to 6 significant digits to be considered equivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates state the solution set as 

 x = π n

The only difference is that Candidate 2 explicitly says “n is any integer,” whereas Candidate 1 leaves the nature of n implicit. In standard mathematical notation for trigonometric-equation solutions, an unspecified n is universally understood to range over all integers. The omission therefore does not introduce real ambiguity about the solution set.

Thus the two answers describe the same set of x-values.

The two candidates give different formulas:

• Candidate 1: κ(t) = 1 / [40 |sin(t/2)|]  
• Candidate 2: κ(t) = 1 / [40 sin(t/2)]

Candidate 1 uses an absolute value to ensure curvature is non-negative, while Candidate 2 does not. For values of t where sin(t/2) is negative, the two expressions have opposite signs; curvature cannot be negative, so the formulas are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply a rate for each of the five sub-problems.

Sub-problem by sub-problem:

1. $6 per hour  vs.  $6.00 per hour   → same value and unit (dollars/hour).
2. 4 per person  vs.  4 slices per person → same numerical value; the only reasonable item here is “slices,” so omission of the noun in Candidate 1 is not ambiguous.
3. 6 per hour  vs.  6 votes per hour → same numeric value; “votes” is implicit from the question, so no ambiguity.
4. 500 per hour  vs.  500 km per hour → same numeric value; given the context (1500 km in 3 h), “km” is the only sensible unit, so omission in Candidate 1 is not confusing.
5. 9 per minute  vs.  9 bags per minute → same numeric value; “bags” is implicit from the question.

Each candidate gives an answer for all five required items, and every corresponding pair of answers is numerically identical with no genuine unit conflict. Therefore, the two sets of predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1  
1 − (2/2!)(x−π/2)² + (2³/4!)(x−π/2)⁴ + …  
→ 1 − 1·(x−π/2)² + (8/24)(x−π/2)⁴ + …  
→ 1 − (x−π/2)² + (1/3)(x−π/2)⁴ + …

Candidate 2  
1 − (x−π/2)² + (1/3)(x−π/2)⁴ − …

Thus the coefficients of the constant, quadratic, and quartic terms coincide, and both series are written about the same center with no unit issues. Therefore the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 specifies that the curve changes concavity: it is concave up on the two intervals \((0,\infty)\) and \(\left(-\infty,-\tfrac12\right)\), but concave down on \(\left(-\tfrac12,0\right)\).

Candidate 2 simply states “Concave up,” which implies the curve is concave up everywhere (no interval of concave down is mentioned).

Because Candidate 1 predicts a region of concave down while Candidate 2 does not, the two answers are not the same.

The two candidates give, respectively,

Candidate 1: (a^{2x} − 1) / (2 a^{x})

Candidate 2: (a^{x} − a^{−x}) / 2.

Let y = a^{x} (note y > 0, since a > 1).  
Then a^{2x} = y^{2} and a^{−x} = 1/y.

• Candidate 1 becomes (y^{2} − 1)/(2y).  
• Candidate 2 becomes (y − 1/y)/2 = [(y^{2} − 1)/y]/2 = (y^{2} − 1)/(2y).

Both simplify to the identical expression (y^{2} − 1)/(2y). Hence the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

The problem asks for “two consecutive even numbers whose product is 624.”  
Candidate 1 lists four numbers: 24, 26, –24, –26 (i.e., two separate pairs).  
Candidate 2 lists only one pair: 24 and 26.

Because Candidate 1 includes an additional pair (–24, –26) that Candidate 2 omits, the two answers are not identical. Under Rule 2 and Rule 3, differing lists of solutions (extra elements vs. only one pair) make the candidates inequivalent.

The two candidates give the same final numerical value for the integral, \( \frac{11}{140} \).

The two candidates give the coordinates in different forms.  
• Candidate 2 gives (± 2/√(1+m²), ± 2m/√(1+m²)), so the y–coordinate keeps the factor “m”, allowing it to be either positive or negative, exactly matching y = m x for every real m.  

• Candidate 1 writes the y–coordinate as √(4m²/(1+m²)) = 2|m|/√(1+m²).  Because of the absolute value, this y–coordinate is always non-negative (or non-positive only after the overall ‘−’ sign). For negative m the first listed point has y > 0 while the line gives y = m x < 0, and the second point likewise mismatches. Thus Candidate 1’s points coincide with the true intersection points only when m ≥ 0; for m < 0 they are incorrect.

Since the two answers are not the same for all permitted m, the candidates are not equivalent.
The coordinates in Candidate 2 contain the factor m (with its sign), so for any slope m—positive or negative—the points (±2/√(1+m²), ±2m/√(1+m²)) satisfy y = mx and x²+y²=4.

In Candidate 1 the y–coordinates use √(m²)=|m|, which is always non-negative.  Thus for a negative slope m the point
(√(4/(1+m²)), √(4m²/(1+m²))) has y = (+2|m|/√(1+m²)) while mx would be negative, so that point is not on the line y = mx (and similarly for the second point). Therefore Candidate 1’s pair of points does not agree with Candidate 2’s for negative m, and the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 writes the intersection points as  
( 2 / √(1+m²),  2 |m| / √(1+m²) ) and ( –2 / √(1+m²),  –2 |m| / √(1+m²) )  
because the square‐root of m² is always non-negative.

Candidate 2 gives  
( ± 2 / √(1+m²),  ± 2 m / √(1+m²) ).

For m ≥ 0, |m| = m and both candidates coincide.  
For m < 0, Candidate 1’s first point has y > 0 while the line y = m x would require y < 0; hence those coordinates do not satisfy the line equation. Candidate 2, however, keeps the sign of m in the y-coordinate, so its points do lie on the line for all real m.

Therefore the two sets of points are not the same for negative slopes, and the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:  (1/2)(-1)ⁿ n! [1/(x-1)^{n+1} + 1/(x+1)^{n+1}]

Since (x+1)^(-(n+1)) = 1/(x+1)^{n+1} and addition is commutative, the two expressions are algebraically identical. They provide the same single required answer, with identical constants and exponents.

The two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant.

• Candidate 1 gives  
 I₁ = C + 5 ln|1+(6x)^{1/3}| + (6x)^{2/3} − 5(6x)^{1/3} − 6 arctan[(6x)^{1/6}].

• Candidate 2 gives  
 I₂ = C + (1/3)(6x)^{2/3} − (5/3)(6x)^{1/3} + (2/3) ln(1+(6x)^{1/3}).

Subtracting,  

 I₁ − I₂ = (13/3) ln(1+(6x)^{1/3}) + (2/3)(6x)^{2/3} − (10/3)(6x)^{1/3} − 6 arctan[(6x)^{1/6}],  

which plainly depends on x (it contains ln, power, and arctan terms). Since the difference is not a constant, the two expressions are inequivalent antiderivatives.

The two candidates give different descriptions for the interval of concavity:

• Candidate 1 lists concave-up on (-2, 0) and (0, ∞), explicitly excluding x = 0.  
• Candidate 2 lists concave-up on (-2, ∞), which includes x = 0.

Since the question normally requires the interval where y'' > 0, these intervals are not identical.  
They also differ in how they state the inflection point (Candidate 1 gives full coordinate, Candidate 2 gives only x-value). Thus, the answers are not exactly the same for each sub-problem.

Candidate 1:  −3 + (1/3) log₄ x + (1/3) log₄ y  
Candidate 2:  (1/3) log₄ x + (1/3) log₄ y − 3

Since addition is commutative, these are mathematically identical.

The two candidates state exactly the same set of \(x\)-values:

• Candidate 1:  \(-\frac{\pi}{6} + 2k\pi \le x \le \frac{7\pi}{6} + 2k\pi\).

• Candidate 2:  \(x \in \bigl[-\frac{\pi}{6} + 2\pi k,\; \frac{7\pi}{6} + 2\pi k \bigr]\).

Both describe the closed interval \(\left[-\frac{\pi}{6},\frac{7\pi}{6}\right]\) shifted by integer multiples of \(2\pi\). Hence they are mathematically identical (the use of “\(k\)” without further comment customarily means \(k\in\mathbb Z\)). Therefore the answers are equivalent.

The question requires four numerical answers (average velocities for four intervals).  
Both candidates list four values in the same order, but for the third interval Candidate 1 gives −48.995100 m/s, whereas Candidate 2 gives +48.995100 m/s (sign difference).  
Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not identical (Rule 2 and Rule 4).

Both answers specify the same condition once we recall that  

p = lim |a_{n+1}/a_n|  ≥ 0.

• Candidate 1:  |p| < 1/2.  
   Because p ≥ 0, |p| = p, so this is p < 1/2.

• Candidate 2:  p < 1/2.

Thus the two conditions are identical.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers concern the same quantity p, which (being the limit of |a_{n+1}/a_n|) is always non-negative.  

• Candidate 1: “|p| < 1/2” ⇒ for non-negative p this is simply p < 1/2.  
• Candidate 2: “p < 1/2”.

Because p ≥ 0 by definition, the two conditions describe exactly the same set of admissible values of p. Hence the predictions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The limit \(p = \displaystyle\lim_{n\to\infty}\bigl|\tfrac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\bigr|\) is, by definition, a non-negative real number (because it is a limit of absolute values).

• Candidate 1: “\(|p| < \tfrac12\)”  
 Since \(p \ge 0\), \(|p| = p\). Thus this condition reduces to \(p < \tfrac12\).

• Candidate 2: “\(p < \tfrac12\)”

After accounting for \(p \ge 0\), both candidates impose exactly the same inequality \(p < \tfrac12\). Hence their predictions are equivalent.

The question explicitly asks for the first four non-zero terms “followed by dots,” indicating the answer must show the continuation of the infinite series.  

• Candidate 1:  x − 2x² + 3x³ − 4x⁴ + …  (includes the ellipsis)  
• Candidate 2:  x − 2x² + 3x³ − 4x⁴  (no ellipsis)

Although the numerical coefficients of the first four terms match, Candidate 2 omits the required ellipsis that signals the series continues. Hence the two responses are not fully equivalent according to the problem’s stated requirement.

The first answer gives an interest rate of 4.492 %.  
Converting this to a pure decimal: 4.492 % = 0.04492.

The second answer is given directly as the decimal 0.0449.

Express both to six significant digits:
• 4.492 % → 0.0449200  
• 0.0449   → 0.0449000

They differ beginning with the fourth significant digit (…49200 vs …49000).  
Therefore, the two predictions are not numerically the same.

Candidate 1 gives the rate as 4.492 %, which in decimal form is 0.04492.  
Candidate 2 gives the rate directly as 0.0449.

Converting both to the same unit (decimal), we compare:

• Candidate 1: 0.044920 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 0.044900 (to six significant digits)

They differ at the 5th significant digit (…4920 vs …4900).  
Since Rule 4 requires agreement to six significant digits, the two values are not equivalent.

The question asks for the (real) solutions of the quartic.  
Both candidates ultimately present the same three numbers as the actual solutions:

• Candidate 1’s concluding list of solutions is “\(x=\sqrt{5},\,-\sqrt{5},\,-1\)” (the earlier “1, –1, 5, –5” are only labeled as *possible rational zeros*, not final answers).  
• Candidate 2 lists exactly “–1, √5, –√5”.

Thus, ignoring order (which is not specified to matter) both answers supply the identical set { –1, √5, –√5 } and no extra solutions are asserted.

Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates give answers for all nine requested items, so we compare each item:

1. Domain – both give (−∞, ∞).  (equivalent)  
2. Vertical asymptotes – both “None”.  (equivalent)  
3. Horizontal asymptotes – both y = −π/2.  (equivalent)  
4. Slant asymptotes – both “None”.  (equivalent)  
5. Increasing intervals – Candidate 1: (−∞,0) and (0,∞); Candidate 2: (−∞,0) only. (different)  
6. Decreasing intervals – Candidate 1: (−∞,0) and (0,∞); Candidate 2: (0,∞) only. (different)  
7–9. Even if items 7–9 matched, the discrepancies in items 5 and 6 already make the overall answers inequivalent under Rule 2.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the solution family  
 x = π/8 + k·π/4 (k ∈ ℤ).

Candidate 2 gives the solution family  
 x = π/8 + k·π/2 (k ∈ ℤ).

Because π/2 = 2·(π/4), every value from Candidate 2 also appears in Candidate 1, but Candidate 1 contains additional values in between (e.g., 3π/8, 7π/8, …).  
Hence the two answer sets are not identical, so the candidates are inequivalent.

The answer requires a single point (x-, y-coordinates).  
Candidate 1: (0.8351, 0.6974)  
Candidate 2: (0.835, 0.697)

Compare each coordinate to six significant digits (Rule 4):

x-coordinate: 0.835100 vs 0.835000 → differ at the 4th decimal place.  
y-coordinate: 0.697400 vs 0.697000 → differ at the 4th decimal place.

Since both coordinates do not match to six significant digits, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:
(1/3) cos³(2x) − (2/5) cos⁵(2x) + (1/7) cos⁷(2x) + C

All corresponding coefficients and signs match; the only difference is the placement/order of terms and of the integration constant, which does not change the mathematical expression. Hence the answers are equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 writes “g(x) = (9/5)·y + 32”.  
  – The right-hand side is expressed in terms of “y”, but the function is stated as g(x).  
  – The input variable is unclear/undefined, so the formula is ambiguous and effectively incomplete.

• Candidate 2 gives “f⁻¹(x) = (9/5)x + 32”, which is a clear, unambiguous expression for the inverse function.

Because Candidate 1’s answer uses an undefined variable and therefore does not clearly give the required inverse function, while Candidate 2 does, the two answers cannot be considered equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different expressions.

• Candidate 1:  g(x) = (9/5) · y + 32 (the formula is written in terms of y, not the input variable x, so g as written does not depend on its argument x).

• Candidate 2:  f⁻¹(x) = (9/5) x + 32.

Since the right-hand sides are written with different variables, they are not algebraically identical; Candidate 1’s expression is ill-defined as a function of x, whereas Candidate 2 provides an explicit function of x. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: (2x + 1) √(x² + 8x) + 3 ln(x + 4 + √(x² + 8x)) + C

They differ only in the logarithm:

• Candidate 1 uses ln |…|, which is defined (as a real‐valued function) for both positive and negative arguments of the log, provided the absolute value is non-zero.

• Candidate 2 uses ln(…), which is real-valued only when the argument is strictly positive.  
For the integrand’s domain x≤–8 or x≥0, the quantity x + 4 + √(x² + 8x) is positive on x≥0 but negative on x≤–8. Thus Candidate 2 is undefined on the entire branch x≤–8, whereas Candidate 1 remains well defined there.

Because Candidate 2 fails to coincide with Candidate 1 (indeed, is not even defined) on part of the domain, the two antiderivatives are not equivalent up to an additive constant.

• Candidate 2: 0.0046585

They are the same value (0.00465850 to six significant digits). Both are unit-less upper bounds, matching the question’s requirements. Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

Because (x − 1)(x + 1) = x² − 1 and (x + 6)(x − 6) = x² − 36, the two formulas are exactly the same rational function (with identical domains: x ≠ ±6). Therefore the predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1: \( \dfrac{(8\sqrt{3}-4)\sqrt{2}}{3} \)

Candidate 2: \( \dfrac{11\sqrt{2}}{18} \)

Evaluate (to compare to 6 significant digits):

• Candidate 1  
 \(8\sqrt{3}-4 \approx 13.85640646-4 = 9.85640646\)  
 Multiply by \(\sqrt{2}\): \(9.85640646 \times 1.41421356 \approx 13.94427191\)  
 Divide by 3: \(13.94427191 / 3 \approx 4.64809064\)

• Candidate 2  
 \(11\sqrt{2} = 11 \times 1.41421356 \approx 15.55634916\)  
 Divide by 18: \(15.55634916 / 18 \approx 0.86424162\)

Comparing: 4.64809… vs. 0.864242… These differ well beyond six significant digits, hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers are single numerical values for the same quantity (an area).  
Candidate 1: 184/3 ≈ 61.333333  
Candidate 2: 112/3 ≈ 37.333333

Both answers give:

1. Radius of convergence: \(R=\infty\).

2. Sum of the series:  

   • Candidate 1 (for \(x\neq0\)): 
   \(f(x)=\dfrac{3}{x^{2}}+\dfrac{3xe^{x}-3e^{x}}{x^{2}}
          =\dfrac{3\bigl(1+e^{x}(x-1)\bigr)}{x^{2}}\).

   • Candidate 2:  
   \(f(x)=\dfrac{3\bigl(1+e^{x}(x-1)\bigr)}{x^{2}}\).

These two formulas are algebraically identical.  
Candidate 1 also states the value at \(x=0\) (obtained by the limit), \(f(0)=\frac32\). Candidate 2 omits this single-point definition but its formula has the same limit \(3/2\); therefore the predicted sum function coincides with that of Candidate 1 on the whole domain via continuous extension.

Since both candidates supply the same radius and the same sum (up to this harmless point-value convention), their answers are equivalent.

The curvature should be a non-negative quantity.  

Candidate 1: κ = 1 / [48 · |sin(t/2)|] (always non-negative)  
Candidate 2: κ = 1 / [48 · sin(t/2)] (changes sign when sin(t/2) < 0)

Because the absolute-value bars are present only in Candidate 1, the two formulas differ in sign whenever sin(t/2) is negative. Hence they are not equivalent.

Both answers list two infinite families of zeros.

Family A  
• Candidate 1: x = –π/4 + nπ  
• Candidate 2: x = 3π/4 + nπ  

Because 3π/4 + nπ = –π/4 + (n+1)π for any integer n, the two expressions generate exactly the same set of numbers. Hence the first families coincide.

Family B  
• Candidate 1: x = arctan(1/2) + nπ  
• Candidate 2: x = arctan(1/2) + nπ  

These are identical.

Thus every zero given by one candidate appears in the other, and vice-versa. The two predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates give the constant term π²/3 and the cosine coefficients 4(-1)ⁿ / n².  
Candidate 1 writes the series as π²/3 – 4( cos x/1² – cos 2x/2² + cos 3x/3² – … ), which after distributing the –4 becomes π²/3 + 4 ∑ₙ₌₁^∞(-1)ⁿ cos nx / n², exactly the form given explicitly in Candidate 2.

Thus the two expressions are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give the same radial bound  
 r ∈ [0, 4 cos θ].

For θ:

• Candidate 2 lists the two sub-intervals in [0,2π):  
 θ ∈ [0, π/2] ∪ [3π/2, 2π].

• Candidate 1 uses a single interval  
 θ ∈ [3π/2, 5π/2].  
This covers [3π/2, 2π] and then continues to [2π, 5π/2], which is just the previous [0, π/2] shifted by 2π. Since adding 2π to an angle gives the same geometric direction, Candidate 1’s interval represents exactly the same set of directions as Candidate 2’s two intervals.

Thus both descriptions define the same region D in polar coordinates.

Both candidates give the antiderivative

Candidate 1’s form
    –3(1+4 tan²x)/(8 tan²x · tan²ᐟ³x)
simplifies to that same expression, so the two answers are mathematically identical up to the additive constant of integration.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions simplify to the same function:

Candidate 1  
- (3/8)·(1 + 4 tan²x) / tan^{8/3}x  
= ‑(3/8) tan^{-8/3}x – (3/2) tan^{-2/3}x + C

which is identical to Candidate 2.

The two answers differ in the expression for the normal component of acceleration.  
• Candidate 1: \(a_N = \omega^{2}\,|a|\) (magnitude of \(a\))  
• Candidate 2: \(a_N = a\,\omega^{2}\) (no absolute value)

Unless the problem explicitly states that \(a\) is known to be positive, these are not guaranteed to be the same (e.g., if \(a<0\), the two results differ in sign). Hence, the candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for two scalar quantities:  
1. tangential component of acceleration  
2. normal component of acceleration.

Both candidates give two answers, so the number of sub-answers matches.

Comparing each sub-answer:

1. Tangential component: both give 0 → identical.

2. Normal component:  
   • Candidate 1:  ω² |a| (explicit absolute value, always non-negative)  
   • Candidate 2:  a ω² (no absolute value, could be negative if a<0)

These expressions are not algebraically identical; they differ by a possible sign. Since the problem statement does not declare a to be strictly positive, we cannot assume |a| = a. Therefore the two candidates’ second answers are not guaranteed to be the same.

Hence the overall answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical solution to the equation, and both state that solution as \(x = \frac{3}{2}\) (i.e., 1.50000 to six significant digits). No units are involved, the question requires only one answer, and the numerical values match exactly. Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers consist of a single numerical value.

• Candidate 1: “x = 3/2”.  
• Candidate 2: “3/2”.

The problem asks for the value of x that satisfies the equation; only one solution exists. Both candidates give the same number (3/2 = 1.500000 to six significant digits) and no units are involved.

Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates agree on the radius of convergence (\(R=\infty\)).

Sum of the series  
• Candidate 1 (for \(x\neq0\)):  
 \(f(x)=\dfrac{e^{x}(x^{2}-2x+2)-2}{x^{3}}\), and explicitly adds \(f(0)=\tfrac13\).

• Candidate 2 gives only  
 \(\dfrac{e^{x}(x^{2}-2x+2)-2}{x^{3}}\).

Thus the two expressions coincide for every \(x\neq0\), but Candidate 2 leaves the value at \(x=0\) undefined, whereas Candidate 1 specifies the (removable-singularity) value \(1/3\).  
Since the series certainly converges at \(x=0\) and the question asks for the full sum, omitting this value is a missing component and the two answers are not identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give

1. the same radius of convergence ( ∞ );
2. algebraically identical formulas for the sum on x≠0:

 Candidate 1: e^x(x^2−2x+2) − 2
        ———————————— −→ after simplification identical
              x^3

 Candidate 2: e^x(x^2−2x+2) − 2
        ————————————
              x^3

Candidate 1 additionally specifies the (removable-singularity) value at x=0, but Candidate 2’s expression has the same limit 1/3, so no contradiction arises. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Therefore the two series are not the same for all orders.

• Candidate 2:  \(x = -\dfrac{\sqrt 2}{4},\;0,\;\dfrac{\sqrt 2}{4}\)

Since \(2\sqrt[4]{4} = 2\sqrt{2}=4/\sqrt 2\), the numerical values coincide.  
However, Candidate 1 also classifies the points (maxima at the two non-zero points, minimum at 0), while Candidate 2 merely lists the points without stating which are maxima and which are minima.  
Because the question asks to “find the local extrema … using the First Derivative Test,” identification of each point as a local maximum or minimum is an essential part of the required information. Candidate 2 omits this classification, so the answers are not equally complete.

Both expressions use the same unit (none) and represent the same real number:

Using the change-of-base formula, log₁₀(3) = ln 3 / ln 10, so

−14 / log₁₀(3) = −14 / (ln 3 / ln 10) = −14 · (ln 10 / ln 3).

This is exactly Candidate 2’s expression.

Hence the two candidates are mathematically identical.

Candidate 1 gives the month count as the exact expression  
x = ln(0.15)/(−0.28) ≈ 6.77543.

Candidate 2 states the answer as 6.78 months.

Interpreting 6.78 to six significant digits gives 6.78000, which differs from 6.77543 in the fourth decimal place.  
By Rule 4, two numerical answers must agree to six significant digits to be considered equivalent. They do not.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the answer in symbolic form:  
x = ln(0.15)/(-0.28).

Evaluating this:  
ln(0.15) ≈ −1.897119985  
⇒ x ≈ (−1.897119985)/(−0.28) ≈ 6.7754285 months.

Expressed to six significant digits: 6.77543.

Candidate 2 states: 6.78 months, i.e. 6.78000 to six significant digits.

Comparing 6.77543 and 6.78000, they differ already in the third decimal place and thus are not identical to six significant digits, as required by Rule 4.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two distinct pieces of information:  
• points where the tangent is horizontal,  
• points where the tangent is vertical.  

Candidate 1 explicitly separates these two categories:
– horizontal: (0, 0) and (2^{1/3}, 2^{2/3})  
– vertical:   (2^{2/3}, 2^{1/3})

Candidate 2 merely lists the three points without indicating which ones correspond to horizontal versus vertical tangents.

Because the classification into horizontal vs. vertical tangents is required and Candidate 2 omits it, the two answers are not fully equivalent under Rule 2 (each sub-answer must be present and identified).

The two expressions differ by terms that depend on x (specifically an \(x\) term and an \(\arcsin(x/2)\) term).  Since an antiderivative can only differ from another by an additive constant independent of x, the presence of these x-dependent differences means the candidates cannot represent the same antiderivative.

Both candidate expressions are algebraically identical:

Candidate 1: μ = b (2 √3 − ln(2 + √3))  
Candidate 2: μ = 2 b √3 − b ln(2 + √3)

Distributing the b in Candidate 1 gives 2 b √3 − b ln(2 + √3), exactly Candidate 2. Hence they are equivalent.

The two candidates give

• Candidate 1: √2 / n^{3/2}  
• Candidate 2: √2 / (n √n)

Since n √n = n·n^{1/2} = n^{1+1/2} = n^{3/2}, the denominators are identical.  
The numerators are the same (√2).

Therefore the two expressions are mathematically identical.

Both answers give the same three numerical values for the box’s dimensions: 4 in, 6 in, and 8 in.  

The question only asks for “the dimensions of the box” without prescribing an order, so order does not matter (Rule 3). Candidate 2 assigns the numbers explicitly (width = 4, length = 8, height = 6), while Candidate 1 just lists them (4, 6, 8). As an unordered set the two answers coincide, hence they are equivalent.

The problem asks for two numerical quantities (radius and height).  
Candidate 1 gives  
• r = (1 + 5.40740373)/3 ≈ 2.13580124 m  
• h = 1.80246791 m  

Candidate 2 gives  
• 1.8 m  
• 2.136 m  

Taking six significant digits, Candidate 1’s numbers are  
• r = 2.13580 m  
• h = 1.80247 m  

Candidate 2’s numbers are  
• 2.13600 m  
• 1.80000 m  

Comparing the corresponding values:

radius: 2.13580 ≠ 2.13600 (differ at the 4th significant digit)  
height: 1.80247 ≠ 1.80000 (differ at the 4th significant digit)

Thus, the two candidates do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Additionally, Candidate 2 does not specify which value is the radius and which is the height, introducing ambiguity.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates disagree on the classification of the critical point (0, 0):

• Candidate 1: says the second–derivative test is inconclusive at (0, 0) and lists no saddle point.  
• Candidate 2: explicitly states that (0, 0) is a saddle point.

Because they provide different outcomes for the same critical point, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same information:

• Minimum value: both say \(-16/35\).

• Maximum value: both state it does not exist (“None” vs. “there is no maximum”).

Thus the predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates give explicit formulas for d³f/dx³.

Candidate 1: 
 -\frac{84x²+1372}{(x²-49)³}

Candidate 2:
 \frac{2}{(x+7)³}-\frac{2}{(x-7)³}
  = \frac{2[(x-7)³-(x+7)³]}{(x²-49)³}
  = \frac{2[-42x²-686]}{(x²-49)³}
  = -\frac{84x²+1372}{(x²-49)³}

Thus candidate 2 simplifies exactly to candidate 1. They are algebraically identical, hence equivalent.

The answers are single numerical values representing the same quantity (present value).  
Using Rule 4, express each to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 78.3526 → 78.3526  
• Candidate 2: 78.35   → 78.3500

Comparing digit by digit, they differ at the 5th significant digit (…52 vs …50). Therefore the two answers are not identical to 6 significant digits and are not equivalent.

The two candidates give single numerical values.

Candidate 1: 0.4295 → written to six significant digits: 0.429500  
Candidate 2: (e − 1)/4 ≈ 0.429570 (to six significant digits).

Comparing the six significant-digit representations, 0.429500 ≠ 0.429570.  
Because they differ within the first six significant digits, the answers are not equivalent (Rule 4).

The question asks for an angle.  
Possible commonly used units for an angle are degrees and radians.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly states “60°,” i.e. 60 degrees.  
• Candidate 1 just writes “60.0” with no unit.  

Since multiple angle units are reasonably possible and Candidate 1 omits the unit, its answer is ambiguous.  
Under Rule 1, when such ambiguity exists the two answers are not considered equivalent.

The numerical values represented by the two candidates are different.

• Candidate 1: 0.000544 → expressed to 6 significant digits: 0.000544000  
• Candidate 2: 1/1837 ≈ 0.000544365 → expressed to 6 significant digits: 0.000544365  

Since 0.000544000 ≠ 0.000544365 at 6 significant-digit precision, the two answers are not equivalent.

0.6667 (interpreted with six significant digits as 0.666700) and 2/3 (which is 0.666667 to six significant digits) differ at the 4th–6th significant digits.

Both candidates answer the single Yes/No question.

• Candidate 1: “False”  
  – In a Yes/No context, “False” corresponds to “No.”

• Candidate 2: “No, we cannot reject …”  
  – Explicitly states “No.”

Thus both give the same decision: we cannot reject H₀ at α = 0.01. According to Rule 2 (Yes/No equivalence of “False” and “No”), the predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical values for the same quantity.

• Candidate 1: 0.322  → interpreted as 0.322000 at six-significant-digit precision.  
• Candidate 2: log₂(5/4) = 0.321928…

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

0.322000 ≠ 0.321928

Since they differ within the required precision, the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 0.17.  
The quantity requested (“stopping potential”) is uniquely measured in volts, and the question explicitly states “in V.”  
Candidate 2 makes the unit explicit (“0.17 V”), while Candidate 1 omits it, but in this context the omission is unambiguous: 0.17 can only reasonably mean 0.17 V.

Candidate 1 gives the numeric answer 0.322 (i.e., 0.322000 to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives the expression (√2 / 2) e^(−π/4).  Numerically,

(√2 / 2) e^(−π/4) ≈ 0.322397.

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 0.322000  
• Candidate 2: 0.322397  

They differ beginning at the fourth decimal place, so they do not match to six significant digits. Hence, the two predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 gives the pure number 4.15, which in this context means 4.15 × 10^11 m.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly writes 4.15 × 10^11 m.

Thus, there is no unit conflict or numerical difference. The two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the value 81600.0 with no unit specified.  
Candidate 2 gives the value 7.0 eV.

The question explicitly requests a result “in eV.”  
Because Candidate 1 omits the unit, it is ambiguous whether 81600.0 is meant to be in eV (which would differ enormously from 7 eV) or in kelvin (which would convert to ≈7 eV and thus match). Rule 1 states that when an omission of units introduces such ambiguity, the answers are considered inequivalent.

The question explicitly asks for the memory size “in Mebibytes (MiB).”

• Candidate 1 gives “5.93” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “5.93 MiB,” explicitly including the unit.

Because several different units for memory size are conceivable (bytes, kB, MB, KiB, MiB, etc.), omitting the unit introduces ambiguity. Under Rule 1, when one answer omits a unit that is required by the question and multiple units are plausible, the two answers are not considered equivalent.

Both answers are single numerical present values in dollars.

Express each to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 2002.0781 → 2.0020781 × 10³ → 6-digit rounding gives 2.00208 × 10³ = 2002.08  
• Candidate 2: 2002.08 already has exactly 6 significant digits: 2002.08 = 2.00208 × 10³

The two values match to 6 significant digits, so the predictions are equivalent.

The two answers are both given (implicitly) in meters, so units can be compared directly.

Express both values with the same exponent and to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 4.7 × 10⁻³⁴  → 4.70000 × 10⁻³⁴  
• Candidate 2: 4.65 × 10⁻³⁴ → 4.65000 × 10⁻³⁴

The significant‐digit strings 4.70000 and 4.65000 differ, so the numbers do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: 0.16667  
• Candidate 2: 1/6 = 0.166666…

Expressing each to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 → 0.166670  
• Candidate 2 → 0.166667  

These differ at the 6th significant digit, so the answers are not identical to the required precision.

The question expects a binary (Yes/No) answer about absolute convergence.

• Candidate 1 responds with “1.0,” a numerical value, not an explicit Yes/No statement.  
• Candidate 2 responds with “Yes,” explicitly answering the question.

These answers are of different types and do not convey the same information. They are therefore not equivalent (Rule 6).

Both candidates give the same single numerical answer, “59,” to the problem. Since:

• The question requires exactly one integer.  
• Both candidates supply that same integer (no unit ambiguity).  
• No additional sub-answers are needed.

the two answers are identical.

Both answers give only a single numerical price, but:

• Candidate 1: 91.17  
• Candidate 2: 911.64  

If Candidate 1’s 91.17 were intended as “per \$100 face value,” converting it to the common \$1 000 face‐value basis multiplies it by 10, giving 911.70.  Comparing 911.70 (from Candidate 1) with 911.64 (Candidate 2) shows a difference at the 5th significant digit (911.700 vs 911.640).  Rule 4 requires equality to at least six significant digits; they do not match.

Without conversion, the raw numbers differ by a factor of 10, so they are clearly not the same value.

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: −64.62 → written with 4 significant digits; expressed to 6 significant digits it is −64.6200.  
• Candidate 2: −12 √29 ≈ −64.6219777 → to 6 significant digits it rounds to −64.6220.

Comparing the 6-significant-digit representations:

−64.6200 ≠ −64.6220

Since they differ within the required 6 significant digits, the two predictions are not equivalent (Rule 4).

• Candidate 2: 386.416 → already has six significant digits: 386.416  

The two results match exactly to six significant digits, satisfying Rule 4. Hence the predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a condition on the eigenvalues of A.  

• Candidate 2 says explicitly: “A has an eigenvalue equal to 2 or 3.”  
  – This means at least one eigenvalue of A equals 2 or 3; the other eigenvalue can be anything.

• Candidate 1 gives only the list “[2, 3]”.  
  – In this context a 2×2 matrix has two eigenvalues; listing “2, 3” most naturally reads as “the eigenvalues of A are 2 and 3.”  
  – That is a stricter requirement than Candidate 2’s “has an eigenvalue equal to 2 or 3.”  
  – Because Candidate 1 does not state that just one of them may suffice, its meaning is not the same as Candidate 2’s.

Since Candidate 1’s statement (interpreted as both eigenvalues are 2 and 3) is different from Candidate 2’s statement (at least one eigenvalue is 2 or 3), the two answers are not equivalent.

The answers are single numerical values.  
Expressed to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 0.186 → 0.186000  
• Candidate 2: 0.1856 → 0.185600  

Since 0.186000 ≠ 0.185600, they do not match to six significant digits.

The matrix is 3×3, so three eigen-values (counting multiplicities) are expected.  

• Candidate 1 lists only two numbers: 2 and 6.  
• Candidate 2 lists three numbers: 2, 2, 6.

Candidate 1 therefore omits one occurrence of the eigen-value 2 that Candidate 2 includes. By Rule 2/Rule 3, providing fewer answers than required (or omitting a multiplicity) makes the candidates inequivalent.

The two candidates represent the following numbers:

• Candidate 1: 3.464 → written to six significant digits: 3.46400  
• Candidate 2: 2√3 ≈ 3.464101615… → written to six significant digits: 3.46410

Comparing these values digit-by-digit to six significant digits shows a mismatch (the 5th and 6th digits differ). According to Rule 4, they are therefore not equivalent.

The question explicitly asks for the wavelength “in nm.”  

• Candidate 1 gives “1850.0” (no unit).  
• Candidate 2 gives “1850 nm.”

Given the prompt’s requested unit (nm), it is natural to interpret Candidate 1’s number as 1850 nm. The numerical values (1850.0 vs 1850) are identical up to 6 significant digits, and both correspond to the same wavelength when expressed in nm. The omission of the unit in Candidate 1 does not introduce real ambiguity here because the required unit is clearly specified by the question.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

The question expects a single numerical answer (final amount in dollars).  
Candidate 1 gives 36983.35, candidate 2 gives 36956.75.  
Comparing the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 → 36983.35 → 36983.4 (rounded to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2 → 36956.75 → 36956.7 (rounded to 6 significant digits)

36983.4 ≠ 36956.7, so the answers are different. They are therefore not equivalent.

Both candidates answer the yes/no question in the affirmative.

• Candidate 1: “True”  → affirms that such a function v exists.  
• Candidate 2: “Yes, there exists …” → also affirms existence (and even supplies an explicit v, which is permissible extra information).

Since both give the same affirmative prediction, they are equivalent.

The question expects two possible numeric values.  
Candidate 1 lists 0.6667 and −0.6667.  
Candidate 2 lists 2/3 and −2/3 (≈ 0.666667 and −0.666667).

To test numeric equivalence we compare each value to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• 0.6667 → 0.666700  
• 2/3 → 0.666667  

These differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits, so they do not match to 6 digits.  
The same mismatch occurs for the negative values.

Therefore the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

The question explicitly asks for the answer “in TeV,” so the expected unit is fixed.  

Candidate 1 gives “39.4” (no unit), Candidate 2 gives “39.4 TeV.”  
With the unit predetermined by the question, Candidate 1’s “39.4” is naturally interpreted as 39.4 TeV; no other plausible unit is intended.  
The numerical values are identical (39.4000 vs. 39.4000 at six significant digits).

Hence the two predictions convey the same quantity.

The question asks for “all positive integers … as an ascending list,” i.e., a complete list of numbers satisfying the three divisibility conditions.

Candidate 1 lists three numbers: [4, 16, 65536].  
Candidate 2 lists two numbers: 4, 16.

Because the two lists are not identical (Candidate 1 contains an additional value 65536 that Candidate 2 omits), the answers are different. Under Rule 2/Rule 3, providing a different set or an incomplete set of required items makes the candidates inequivalent.

The question expects a single real number A.  

Candidate 1 gives 31.4.  
Candidate 2 gives 10 π ≈ 31.415926…

Expressed to six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 → 31.4000  
• Candidate 2 → 31.4159  

Since 31.4000 ≠ 31.4159 at six-digit precision (Rule 4), the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates provide a single numerical value for the inflection point.

• Candidate 1: 2.301  
• Candidate 2: e^(5/6) ≈ 2.3009759 → 2.30098 (to six significant digits)

Expressing Candidate 1 to six significant digits gives 2.30100.  
Comparing 2.30100 and 2.30098 shows a difference at the fourth significant digit, so they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for two quantities:  
(1) 〈2 sₓ〉(t) and  
(2) 〈2 s_z〉(t)  for t > t₀.

Candidate 1 supplies both:
• 〈2 sₓ〉 = –ħ sin[(2 μ_e/ħ) B (t – t₀)]  
• 〈2 s_z〉 = 0

Candidate 2 also supplies two expressions:
• 2 sₓ = ħ sin(ω t)  
• 2 s_z = 0

Comparison:

1. The x-component:  
   – Candidate 1 contains a minus sign and an explicit phase shift (t – t₀).  
   – Candidate 2 lacks the minus sign and the phase shift; the argument is simply ω t.  
   These two time dependences cannot in general be the same for all t unless one makes additional, unjustified assumptions (e.g., redefining t or absorbing the minus sign). Therefore they are not equivalent.

2. The z-component: both give 0, so they match here, but Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to agree. Because the x-component does not agree, the overall answers are inequivalent.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates represent numerical probabilities.

Candidate 1: 0.702 → written with six significant-digits is 0.702000  
Candidate 2: 512/729 ≈ 0.702331962 → six-digit form 0.702332

Comparing digit-by-digit up to six significant digits, they differ at the fourth digit after the decimal (0.702000 vs 0.702332). Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives 0.702 (which equals 0.702000 to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives 512/729 ≈ 0.702332 (0.702332 to six significant digits).  

Comparing 0.702000 and 0.702332 to six significant digits shows a difference at the fourth digit, so the two answers are not numerically identical.

The two candidates give different results for several requested items.

1. Wave-function normalizations in part (a) differ (Candidate 1 uses 1/√π, Candidate 2 uses 1/π, etc.).
2. First-order energy corrections in part (b) disagree: Candidate 1 predicts a splitting of ± (3/4) ε for the first-excited degenerate pair, while Candidate 2 says all corrections are zero.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, Rule 2 declares the answers inequivalent.

Both candidates give a single formula for the transition probability P, so we just compare those two formulas.

1. Rewrite Candidate 1:

A = 32 b e E₀ / (9 ħ π²)

P₁ = A² · ħ² /[α²ħ² + (3π²ħ² / (8m b²))²]
    = (1024 b² e² E₀²)/(81 π⁴) · ħ² /[α²ħ² + 9π⁴ħ⁴/(64 m² b⁴)]
    = 1024 b² e² E₀² /[81 π⁴ ħ² (α² + 9π⁴ħ²/(64 m² b⁴))]

2. Candidate 2 already reads

P₂ = 16 b² e² E₀² /[81 π⁴ ħ² (α² + 9π⁴ħ²/(64 m² b⁴))].

3. Comparison:

P₁ / P₂ = 1024 / 16 = 64.

Everything else (b², e², E₀², denominator) is identical, so Candidate 1 gives a probability 64 times larger than Candidate 2.

Since the two expressions differ by a non-unit numerical factor, they are not equivalent (Rule 4/Rule 8).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions can be rewritten in comparable form.

Candidate 1  
P₁ = 1024 b² e² E₀²  / [ 81 π⁴ ħ² ( α² + 9 π⁴ ħ² / (64 m² b⁴) ) ]

Candidate 2  
P₂ = 256 b² e² E₀²  / [ 81 π⁴ ħ² ( α² + 9 π⁴ ħ² / (64 m² b⁴) ) ]

They are identical except for the overall numerical coefficient in the numerator: 1024 versus 256 (a factor of 4). Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not the same.  
After simplifying Candidate 1 you obtain  

P₁ = 1024 b² e² E₀² / [81 π⁴ ħ² ( α² + 9 π⁴ ħ² /(64 m² b⁴) )] ,

whereas Candidate 2 is  

P₂ = 256 b² e² E₀² / [81 π⁴ ħ² ( α² + 9 π⁴ ħ² /(64 m² b⁴) )] .

The denominators match, but the numerators differ by a factor of 4 (1024 vs 256).  
Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives two distinct answers—“0” for part (a) and “No common eigenstates unless q = 0” for part (b).  
Candidate 2 supplies only a single word, “Yes,” which at best could answer part (b) and leaves part (a) unanswered.  

Because the problem has two sub-questions and Candidate 2 does not provide both required answers, while Candidate 1 does, the two sets of predictions are not the same (Rule 2).

Both candidate expressions are

p = (π ħ²)/(4 × (mass) × R⁵),

differing only in the symbol chosen for the electron’s mass (μ in Candidate 1, m in Candidate 2). Since the problem involves a single electron, both symbols refer to the same physical quantity (the electron’s mass). Apart from this notational difference, the formulas are identical.

The question has three separate demands:

(a) equality of three commutators  
(b) vanishing of those commutators for j = 0, 1/2  
(c) vanishing for j = 1  AND giving a common eigenbasis of Jx², Jy², Jz² for the j = 1 space.

Comparison of the answers:

• Part (a): both candidates state the three commutators are equal – same answer.  
• Part (b): both candidates state the commutators vanish for j = 0 and j = 1/2 – same answer.  
• Part (c):  
 – Candidate 1 supplies an eigenbasis {|1,0⟩ , (|1,1⟩ ± |1,−1⟩)/√2}. This set really is a simultaneous eigenbasis of Jx², Jy², Jz².  
 – Candidate 2 claims the common eigenbasis is simply {|1,1⟩ , |1,0⟩ , |1,−1⟩}. Those three states are NOT simultaneous eigenvectors of Jx² and Jy²; thus Candidate 2’s basis is wrong.  

Therefore the two candidates give different (mutually incompatible) answers for part (c). Hence, according to Rule 2, the overall answers are not equivalent.
The question has three sub-parts:  
(a) state the equality of the three commutators;  
(b) say that each of these commutators gives zero when acting on any j = 0 or ½ state;  
(c) say the same for j = 1 and produce *one* common eigenbasis of Jx², Jy², Jz².

Comparing the two answers:

Sub-part (a)  
• Candidate 1: explicitly writes [Jx², Jy²] = [Jy², Jz²] = [Jz², Jx²].  
• Candidate 2: says they “are equal … derived from the angular momentum commutation relations.”  
→ Same content.  

Sub-part (b)  
• Candidate 1: states the three commutators are 0 for j = 0 or ½.  
• Candidate 2: same statement.  
→ Same content.  

Sub-part (c) has two requirements: (i) say the commutators vanish for j = 1; (ii) supply a common eigenbasis.  
(i) Vanishing:  
 • Candidate 1 never explicitly says they vanish for j = 1; it merely gives an eigenbasis.  
 • Candidate 2 explicitly says they vanish.  
Thus the candidates differ here.

(ii) Eigenbasis:  
 • Candidate 1 gives {|1,0⟩, (|1,1⟩ ± |1,−1⟩)/√2}.  
 • Candidate 2 gives {|1,−1⟩, |1,0⟩, |1,1⟩}.  

For Jx² or Jy² the states |1,±1⟩ are **not** eigenvectors, whereas the ± superpositions are; hence candidate 2’s set is **not** a common eigenbasis, while candidate 1’s is. So even if we ignored the missing “commutator vanishes” statement, the two eigen-bases are not equivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates give different answers for part (c).  
By Rule 2, answers are not equivalent if any sub-answer differs.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates answer all three sub-parts, but

1.  For part (c) they give different “common eigenbases.”
   • Candidate 1:  |1,0〉, (|1,1〉 ± |1,−1〉)/√2  
   • Candidate 2:  the standard |1,m〉 basis (m = −1,0,+1)

   These two sets are not the same, and in fact the |1,m〉 states are not eigenvectors of Jₓ², so the two candidates disagree on the required eigenbasis.

2.  Candidate 1 never explicitly states that the commutators vanish for j = 1, whereas Candidate 2 does.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, Rule 2 says the overall answers are not equivalent.

The question requires four separate answers (parts (a)–(d)).  
To be equivalent, every corresponding sub-answer from the two candidates must match.

• Part (a)  
 Candidate 1: |q γ₁₂ α| / ħ  
 Candidate 2: α e γ₁₂ / ε  

 The two expressions differ: one is divided by ħ while the other is divided by ε.  
 Therefore they are not the same quantity.

Since at least one sub-answer is different, Rule 2 says the entire sets of answers are not equivalent.  
(There is no need to examine parts (b)–(d) further.)

The two candidates give different expressions for parts (a) and (b).

• Part (a):  
 Candidate 1 uses cos²[(m₂ – m₁)c²t / (2ħ)],  
 Candidate 2 uses cos²[Δm² t / (4E)].  
 These are only the same if one arbitrarily sets E ≃ (m₁+m₂)c² / 2, which is not stated in either the problem or the answers. Thus the formulas are not equivalent.

• Part (b):  
 Candidate 1: t = πħ / [(m₂ – m₁)c²]  
 Candidate 2: t = 2πE / Δm²  
 Again these differ by the same non-trivial factor.

• Part (c) is the same (1/2), but all sub-answers must match for overall equivalence (Rule 2).

Hence the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates answer every sub-part (a)–(f), so we compare each corresponding result.

(a) Same qualitative statement ⇒ agree.  
(b) Expectation values:  
 • ⟨x⟩ C1 = √(ħ/2mω)(α+α*); C2 = √(ħ/2mω) Re(α) = ½√(ħ/2mω)(α+α*).  
 • Similar discrepancies appear in ⟨x²⟩, ⟨p⟩, ⟨p²⟩.  
Thus (b) differs.

Since at least one required sub-answer differs (Rule 2), the full answers are not equivalent, even though the later parts largely coincide.

The question has three sub-parts that all require explicit answers.

Sub-part (b) asks for the full set of Lagrange equations.  
• Candidate 1 gives two equations.  For the θ-equation it keeps the correct moment of inertia about the pivot, M(x² + l²/12), so the conserved quantity is M(x² + l²/12) θ̇.  
• Candidate 2 gives ṙ̇ = r θ̇² and (d/dt)(r² θ̇) = 0, i.e. it treats the conserved angular momentum as r² θ̇ (missing the + l²/12 term).

Because the two candidates present different θ-equations, their answers to sub-part (b) are not the same.  Therefore, even though they coincide on (a) and on the long-time limits in (c), the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The problem has four sub-parts.  
Sub-part (a) asks for expressions for both momenta and also asks which of them is constant.

• Candidate 1 supplies the two expressions but gives no statement about constancy.  
• Candidate 2 supplies the same two expressions and explicitly states that \(p_\theta\) is constant.

Because sub-part (a) requires the constancy information and Candidate 1 omits it, Candidate 1 is missing a required component that Candidate 2 provides. Under Rule 2, when one answer is incomplete for a required sub-problem the two candidates are not equivalent.

Hence the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: σ = πR²

These expressions are only identical if the additional term 2GM/(v₀² R) happens to be zero (which would require v₀ → ∞). In general, they are different. Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same functional dependence for the angular momentum after time t: an exponential decay of the initial value by the factor exp(−λt / m). The differences are purely notational (𝐉 vs. L, boldface vs. plain), without any change in mathematical content or required components. Hence the two answers are equivalent.  

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 gives a vector result, explicitly preserving the direction of the initial angular-momentum vector:  
  𝑱(𝑡) = 𝑱₀ e^{−λt/m}.

• Candidate 2 writes L(t) = J₀ e^{−λt/m}.  The notation L(t) with un-bold J₀ normally denotes the scalar magnitude of the angular momentum, not the full vector.  Hence Candidate 2 omits the direction information that Candidate 1 retains.

Because one answer is a vector expression while the other is only (apparently) the scalar magnitude, the two answers convey different quantities and are therefore not equivalent (Rule 6).
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same functional dependence: the angular momentum at time t equals the initial angular momentum multiplied by exp(−λt/m).  
Candidate 1 writes this with explicit boldface to stress the vector character; Candidate 2 omits boldface but otherwise has the identical formula. The notational difference (bold vs. plain) does not change the mathematical content, and nothing else differs.

Both answers give the potential in the form –(constant)/ r², the only difference being the symbol used for angular‐momentum-related constants.

• Candidate 1: V(r)=− m h² /(2 r²)  
 Here h has to carry units of angular momentum per unit mass (standard notation: h = L/m).

• Candidate 2: V(r)= − L² /(2 m r²)  
 L is the usual total angular momentum.

Because L = m h (so m h² = L² / m), the two expressions are algebraically identical:
 − m h² /(2 r²) = − L² /(2 m r²).

Hence the two candidates give the same potential-energy function.

Both candidates give:

(a) Lorentz transformation for the position 4-vector (boost along x).  
• Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 have the same coefficients (γ, –βγ, etc.); the only difference is the ordering of rows/columns, which is just a choice of component order and is mathematically equivalent.  

Momentum 4-vector transformation.  
• Each candidate applies the same Lorentz matrix to (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z).  
• Candidate 1 writes the transformed energy component without a prime, but the formula itself is identical to Candidate 2’s E′ = γ(E – β p_x c). This is clearly a notation slip, not a different result.

(b) Doppler-shift formulas.  
Both candidates list exactly the three required expressions:
i) ν = ν₀√[(1+β)/(1–β)]  
ii) ν = ν₀√[(1–β)/(1+β)]  
iii) ν = ν₀/√(1–β²)

Thus every sub-answer supplied by Candidate 1 is mathematically the same as that of Candidate 2; no required piece is missing from either answer. The slight notational difference does not change the content.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates supply:

• Lorentz transformation for the position 4-vector  
• A momentum-4-vector transformation  
• The three Doppler-shift formulae

The Doppler formulae given by the two candidates are identical, so there is no discrepancy there.  
The crucial difference appears in the momentum transformation:

Candidate 1 (after removing its extra overall factor c in the spatial component definition):
 p′ₓ = γ( pₓ − β E / c )

Candidate 2:
 p′ₓ = γ( pₓ − β E / c² )

The two expressions differ by a factor of c in the second term; they cannot be reconciled merely by a different convention for arranging the components of the 4-vector. Therefore the two answers are not the same for part (a). Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the full sets of answers are not equivalent.

2. Travel time in the Earth’s frame  
3. Ship’s location (in Earth frame) when the signal is received  
4. Ship’s location (in ship frame) when the signal is received  

Candidate 1 gives:  
• 3.7 × 10³ s, 1.11 × 10⁴ s, 3.33 × 10⁹ km, and 0 km.  

Candidate 2 gives:  
• 3.7 × 10³ s, 1.11 × 10⁴ s, 3.33 × 10⁹ km, and 1.11 × 10⁹ km.  

The first three numbers match, but the fourth (ship-frame location) differs: 0 vs 1.11 × 10⁹ km.

The question asks for
1. θ_r and ν′ when the mirror moves in the x-direction with speed v,
2. θ_r and ν′ when the mirror moves in the y-direction with speed v.

Hence four quantities must be supplied.  
Both candidates give four explicit expressions, so we compare each.

For motion in the x-direction  
• Candidate 1:  
 ν′ = ν (1 + 2β cos θ_i + β²)/(1 − β²)  
 cos θ_r = ((1 + β²) cos θ_i + 2β)/(1 + 2β cos θ_i + β²) (⇒ θ_r ≠ θ_i in general)

• Candidate 2:  
 ν′ = ν (1 + β sin θ_i)/(1 − β sin θ_i)  
 θ_r = θ_i

These ν′ formulas are clearly different (cos vs sin, different β dependence), and the angles differ (θ_r equal vs not equal). Therefore they cannot be equivalent.

For motion in the y-direction  
• Candidate 1: ν′ = ν, θ_r = θ_i  
• Candidate 2: ν′ = ν (1 + β cos θ_i)/(1 − β cos θ_i), θ_r = θ_i

Here ν′ is unchanged for Candidate 1 but Doppler-shifted for Candidate 2. Again they disagree.

Since at least one required sub-answer differs between the two candidates, the two overall predictions are not equivalent by Rule 2.

The question requires two independent results:  
1) the speed v′ of the particle in observer 2’s frame,  
2) the direction (e.g. through tan φ′ or velocity components).

Candidate 2 gives complete component formulas, from which both the speed and the direction (tan θ) are explicitly obtained.

Candidate 1:

• Speed:  
 v′ = √[(v²+u²−2vu cosφ−u²v² sin²φ/c²)/(1−uv cosφ/c²)]

 This differs from the expression implied by Candidate 2, which would be  
 v′ = √(numerator)/(1−uv cosφ/c²).  
 Candidate 1 divides only by √(1−uv cosφ/c²) instead of the full factor, so the two formulas are not algebraically equivalent.

• Direction:  
 tan φ′ = v sinφ √(1−u²/c²) … (formula ends with no denominator).  
 The denominator (v cosφ−u) is missing, so the direction result is incomplete/incorrect.

Because at least one of the required sub-answers is different or incomplete and the speed formulas are not algebraically identical, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s expression for tan φ′ is incomplete (no denominator given).  
Moreover, its formula for the speed,
 v′ = √[ (v² + u² − 2uv cos φ − u²v² sin² φ / c²) / (1 − uv cos φ / c²) ],
differs from the speed that follows from Candidate 2’s component formulas, which give

 v′ = √[v² + u² − 2uv cos φ − u²v² sin² φ / c²]  / (1 − uv cos φ / c²).

Candidate 1 misses one power of the denominator (it has √A instead of A), so the magnitudes do not match.  
Because at least one required sub-answer disagrees and another is incomplete, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for three specific results:
(a) a formula that relates θ to m and E₀,  
(b-i) the low-energy limit of θ,  
(b-ii) the high-energy limit of θ.

Comparing the two candidates:

1. Formula (part (a))  
   • Candidate 1:  cos(θ/2)=√[(E₀+mc²)/(E₀+3mc²)]  
   • Candidate 2:  θ = 2 arccos[ √(E₀²−m²c⁴)/(E₀ + m²c²) ]  
   These expressions are plainly different; they cannot be algebraically transformed into one another by simple manipulation, so the candidates disagree for part (a).

2. Low-energy limit (part (b-i))  
   • Both candidates give θ ≃ π/2, so they agree here.

3. High-energy limit (part (b-ii))  
   • Candidate 1: θ ≃ 0.  
   • Candidate 2: θ ≃ 2π/3.  
   These are different.

Since the answers differ for two of the required sub-parts ((a) and (b-ii)), the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent according to Rule 2.

The question asks for a single numerical ratio (dimensionless).

Candidate 1 gives 3.31 → 3.31000 (to 6 significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives 3.3  → 3.30000 (to 6 significant digits).

At six significant digits the values 3.31000 and 3.30000 differ, so the two predictions are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The answers are numerical and dimensionless.

• Candidate 1: 3.31 → 3.31000 (expressed to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 3.3  → 3.30000 (expressed to 6 significant digits)

Comparing the two values to 6 significant digits, 3.31000 ≠ 3.30000.  
Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same numerical factor (5/4) and differ only in whether an explicit factor of c² is written.

In high-energy-physics problems like this one, it is standard to work in natural units where c = 1, so masses (m_t) and energies (E) are both quoted in the same energy units (GeV, etc.).  
• Candidate 1 writes E = (5/4) m_t c² (keeping c² explicit).  
• Candidate 2 writes E = (5/4) m_t (implicitly setting c = 1).

Thus, after accounting for the usual unit convention, the two expressions represent the same physical energy. They are therefore equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions for both requested quantities.

• Circular-orbit period (part (a)):
  – Candidate 1: τ = τ₀ [1 – (C τ₀²)/(8π²)] (with τ₀ = 2π√(r₀³/GM)).
  – Candidate 2: τ = 2π√(r₀³/GM) (no dust correction).

These are not the same unless C = 0.

• Radial-oscillation period (part (b)):
  – Candidate 1: τ_osc = τ₀ [1 – (C τ₀²)/(2π²)].
  – Candidate 2: τ = √(2GM/r₀³) (a frequency, and with no dependence on C).

Again, they disagree.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates answer all three sub-parts but their expressions differ:

1. Radius of circular orbit: Although the two formulas look similar, the dimensionless factors inside the square roots differ (Candidate 1 has …12 GM m³ b/L⁴, Candidate 2 has …12 GM² m⁶ b/L⁴ after factoring), so the two expressions are not algebraically identical.

2. Orbital period: Candidate 1 gives T = 2π m R²/L, Candidate 2 gives T = 2π R²/L (missing the factor m). These are clearly different.

3. Small-oscillation frequency and φ(t): the two candidates present different formulas, and Candidate 1’s ω expression is even incomplete.

Because at least one required answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not identical.

• Candidate 1 uses the full spatial gradient:  \( \dot S = k\bigl(\frac{\nabla T}{T}\bigr)^2 = k\,\frac{|\nabla T|^{2}}{T^{2}}\).

• Candidate 2 writes \( \dot S = \dfrac{k (dT/dx)^{2}}{T^{2}}\), which is only the x-component squared.

They coincide only in the special case where the temperature varies solely in the x-direction (all other partial derivatives zero). In general three-dimensional conduction they differ. Because the problem statement does not constrain the gradient to be one–dimensional, the two candidates are not guaranteed to yield the same value.

The question has two sub-parts:

1. Give two numerical values for E/N.  
2. Give an explicit formula for S/N as a function of E/N.

Comparison of sub-answers:

(a) Maximum E/N values  
• Candidate 1:  ε  (non-eq),  ε/2  (eq)  
• Candidate 2:  ε  (non-eq),  ε/2  (eq)  
These match.

(b) Entropy per atom  
• Candidate 1:  S/N = –k [ p ln p + (1–p) ln (1–p) ] with p = E/(ε N).  
• Candidate 2:  S/N = –k_B [ (E/N) ln(E/N) + (1–E/N) ln(1–E/N) ].

Candidate 2 puts the dimensional quantity E/N directly inside the logarithms, omitting the required division by ε; thus its formula is not the same as Candidate 1’s (and is dimensionally inconsistent). Hence the two candidates give different answers for part (b).

Because one sub-answer differs, the overall answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions.

Sub-problem (a) – entropy change of the system  
• Candidate 1: ΔS = k ln(n₂/n₁)  
• Candidate 2: ΔS = k ln[n₂/(n₁+1)]  
These are not the same.

Sub-problem (b) – entropy change of the reservoir  
Both give ΔS = (E₂ − E₁)/T → same.

Sub-problem (c) – Boltzmann ratio  
• Candidate 1 provides n₂/n₁ = exp[−(E₂ − E₁)/(kT)].  
• Candidate 2 provides n₁/n₂ = exp[(E₂ − E₁)/(kT)].  
Although these two equations are reciprocals of each other, the question explicitly asks for n₁/n₂; Candidate 1 gives the opposite ratio.

Both parts require answers.  
Part (a):  
• Candidate 1 gives the collision frequency as 𝑣̄/λ̄.  
• Candidate 2 states it is P/η.  
(These can be algebraically equivalent, so part (a) could be consistent.)

Part (b): numerical collision frequency:  
• Candidate 1: 5.63 × 10⁹ s⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 1.87 × 10⁹ s⁻¹  

These numbers differ by a factor of ~3 and are nowhere near each other to six significant digits, therefore do not match.

The question has three sub-parts, so each candidate must give three corresponding answers.

Comparison:

(a) Both candidates give essentially the same qualitative reason (“isolated / no energy exchange”), so sub-answers match.

(b) Candidate 1 gives T = 3 K / 2^{1/3}; Candidate 2 gives T = 3 K / 2^{1/4}.  
These two numerical expressions are different (2^{-1/3} ≈ 0.7937 vs 2^{-1/4} ≈ 0.8409). Hence the sub-answers do not match.

(c) Both quote the same black-body energy density integral and give the same order-of-magnitude (≈10^{-14} J m^{-3}), so sub-answers match.

Because sub-answer (b) disagrees, the overall sets of answers are not identical. Under Rule 2, the candidates are inequivalent.

– Candidate 2: 5.22900 × 10³ J  

These differ (5.20000 vs 5.22900), so they are not equivalent.

5340 K → 5.34000 × 10³

Both candidates answer every sub-question, so we must compare their expressions part-by-part.

(a) Density of states  
• Candidate 1:  D(ε)= (2πV / h³)(2m)^{3/2} ε^{1/2}.  
   Using h=2πħ this becomes  D(ε)= V ħ^{-3} (1/4π²)(2m)^{3/2} ε^{1/2}.  
• Candidate 2:  D(ε)= (V/2π²ħ³)·4π·√(2m) √ε = V ħ^{-3}(2/π)√(2m) ε^{1/2}.

Candidate 1’s overall m–dependence is m^{3/2}; Candidate 2’s is m^{1/2}.  The numerical factors also differ (√2/2π² vs 2√2/π).  These two formulas are not the same, so the answers disagree on part (a).

Because at least one required sub-answer differs (Rule 2), the two entire sets of answers cannot be equivalent.

The numerical values match (0.61 vs 0.610), but the units do not:

• Candidate 1: “0.61 cal/K” explicitly includes the entropy unit (cal per kelvin).  
• Candidate 2: “0.610 cal” lacks “per K” (or “per deg”), so it denotes an energy rather than an entropy unless one guesses the missing unit.

Since the question’s result must have units of entropy (energy divided by temperature), omitting “/K” introduces ambiguity. According to Rule 1, such an omission makes the two answers inequivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas:  

Candidate 1: Δp = φ² / (4 π r²)  

Candidate 2: Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)

Even if one tries to interpret different unit systems, the numerical factors cannot be brought into equality without additional assumptions. In SI units, the ratio of the candidate-2 coefficient to the candidate-1 coefficient is ε₀ / 2 divided by 1/(4 π), i.e. 2 π ε₀ ≈ 5.6 × 10⁻¹¹, so the two expressions are clearly not the same. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different formulas:  

• Candidate 1: Δp = φ² / (4 π r²)  
• Candidate 2: Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)

They differ in two ways: the presence of ε₀ in Candidate 2 and different numerical factors (4 π vs 2). Converting between SI and Gaussian units cannot make these expressions identical (even in Gaussian units the pressure would be φ² / (8 π r²), not φ² / (4 π r²)). Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for two distinct results:  

(a) the spectral energy-density formula,  

(b) its total-energy temperature dependence.

• Candidate 1 (a) gives  
 du₍ω₎ = (ħ / π²c³) · ω³ dω / [exp(ħω / 2πkT) – 1]

• Candidate 2 (a) gives  
 (8πh ω³ / c³) · 1 / [exp(hω / kT) – 1] dω

Comparing (a):

1. Exponential factor: C1 has exp(ħω / 2πkT); C2 has exp(hω / kT).  
 These are not the same (factor 2π difference).

2. Prefactor: C1: ħ/π²; C2: 8πh. They differ both numerically and in use of ħ vs h.  
 Even if one interpreted C2’s ω as ordinary frequency ν, symbols and factors still do not match C1.

Thus the spectral densities are inequivalent.

Part (b) both state T⁴, but because the answers to part (a) disagree, overall the candidate sets are not equivalent (Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to match).

• Candidate 1: 9/16 = 0.562500  
• Candidate 2: 5/16 = 0.312500  

The values are different. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ in the denominator:

• Candidate 1: √[ 2 Λ ΔT t / (L / V) ]  
• Candidate 2: √[ 2 Λ ΔT t / L ]

The problem statement explicitly gives the parameter “latent heat per unit volume” as L / V. Candidate 1 keeps this quantity intact, while Candidate 2 omits the factor 1/V (or, equivalently, treats L itself as the per-volume quantity without saying so). Unless one re-interprets symbols contrary to the statement, the two formulas differ by a factor of √V and are not dimensionally the same. Hence they are not equivalent.

The question asks for two pieces of information:  
(a) the average energy (numerical value) and  
(b) a statement of the equipartition principle with brief discussion.

• Candidate 1 only supplies the numerical average energy “\( \overline{E} = \tfrac12 kT \)” (part (a)) and says nothing about part (b).

• Candidate 2 supplies both: the same numerical average energy for part (a) and an explicit statement/discussion for part (b).

Since Candidate 1 omits an answer to one of the required sub-problems, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates provide answers for all three sub-questions (a), (b) and (c).  

Sub-answer comparisons:  
(a) Both describe the same idea (Knudsen vs. continuum flow) → equivalent.  
(b) Candidate 1: \(l_1/l_2 = \sqrt{T_1/T_2}=0.707\). Candidate 2: \(l_1/l_2 = 1/\sqrt{2}=0.707\). These are the same value → equivalent.  
(c) Candidate 1: \(l_1/l_2 = 0.5\). Candidate 2: \(l_1/l_2 = 1\). Values differ → not equivalent.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 do not provide the same expressions for the reduced density matrices.

(a)  
• Candidate 1 simply writes ⟨r′|ρ|r⟩ and ⟨p′|ρ|p⟩, without performing the trace (integral) over the second particle that defines the one-particle reduced density matrix.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly performs that trace: ρ(x₁,x₁′)=∫dx₂⟨x₁,x₂|ρ|x₁′,x₂⟩ and likewise in momentum space.  
Thus their answers for part (a) differ.

(b)  
Although both state that the diagonal of the position-space density matrix is constant when the momentum-space one is diagonal, equivalence across all required sub-answers fails because their part (a) answers are not the same.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question requires five numerical answers.  
Both candidates give five answers with the same units, but:

1. Heat-loss rate: 114 W (C1) vs 114.4 W (C2) → 1.14000 × 10² vs 1.14400 × 10² (different at the 4th significant digit).  
2. ΔS_water: −0.314 W/K (C1) vs −0.315 W/K (C2) (different).  
3. ΔS_room: 0.403 W/K (C1) vs 0.404 W/K (C2) (different).

Since at least one sub-answer differs (indeed three do), the two prediction sets are not identical per Rule 2/Rule 4.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 agree on part (a): both give  
• Equation of state P = NkT / V (i.e., PV = NkT)  
• Internal energy U = 3 NkT.

For part (b) they differ.  
• Candidate 1 supplies the ordinary-gas value U₍ordinary₎ = (3/2) NkT (and says nothing about the equation of state).  
  This implies the relativistic gas has twice the ordinary internal energy.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly states the relativistic gas has “three times the internal energy” of an ordinary gas.

Because the two candidates give different comparative statements for part (b), their overall answers are not identical.

Both candidates give the same Planck-distribution formula for the energy.  
For the entropy:

• Candidate 1 supplies  
  (i) σ(n,N) = N[(1+n/N)ln(1+n/N) – (n/N)ln(n/N)]  
  (ii) σ(U,N) = N[(1+U/(Nħω))ln(1+U/(Nħω)) – (U/(Nħω))ln(U/(Nħω))].

• Candidate 2 supplies only  
  S = kB[(N+n)ln(N+n) – n ln n – N ln N].

After removing the prefactor kB and rewriting n = U/(ħω), Candidate 2’s single formula is algebraically the same as Candidate 1’s part (a), but Candidate 2 never presents the explicit σ(U,N) required in part (b). Thus Candidate 2 omits one of the required sub-answers that Candidate 1 provides.

Because one candidate supplies fewer answers than required while the other supplies all of them, the two answer sets are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question has two sub-problems, so both answers must coincide on BOTH parts.

Sub-problem (a):
• Candidate 1:  \(\dot Q=\dfrac{\pi r_A r_B K\,(T_A-T_B)}{L}\)
• Candidate 2:  \(Q=\dfrac{\pi r_A r_B K\,(T_B-T_A)}{L}\)

These differ by an overall minus sign ( \(T_A-T_B\) vs. \(T_B-T_A\) ).  Unless a specific sign convention was stated, the sign of the heat-flow rate is meaningful; the two formulas are therefore not identical.

Sub-problem (b):
• Candidate 1: \(T_C=(T_A+2T_B)/3\Rightarrow60^\circ\text{C}\)
• Candidate 2: \(60^\circ\text{C}\)

These coincide, but since the two candidates disagree in part (a), the entire set of answers is not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions for both requested probabilities.

Given x = λ e^{-ε/τ}:

• Candidate 1 uses denominators (1 + x)⁴.

• Candidate 2 uses denominators (λ² + x)⁴ = (λ² + λ e^{-ε/τ})⁴, which in general is not equal to (1 + x)⁴.

Candidate 2’s P₁ expression also contains an extra factor λ⁶ in the numerator, absent in Candidate 1.

Because the formulas are not algebraically identical (nor reducible to the same form for arbitrary λ and ε), the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions for both requested probabilities.

For the “exactly one O₂” case  
• Candidate 1: 4 x / (1 + x)⁴, with x = λ e^{-ε/τ}.  
• Candidate 2: 4 x λ³ / (x + λ)⁴.

Substituting x = λ e^{-ε/τ} into Candidate 2’s formula eliminates λ, giving 4 e^{-ε/τ} / (1 + e^{-ε/τ})⁴, which is not the same as Candidate 1’s expression 4 λ e^{-ε/τ} / (1 + λ e^{-ε/τ})⁴ unless λ happens to equal 1.

For the “exactly four O₂” case  
• Candidate 1: (x / (1 + x))⁴.  
• Candidate 2: (x / (x + λ))⁴.

Again, substituting x = λ e^{-ε/τ} into Candidate 2 removes λ, while Candidate 1’s result retains λ, so the two are unequal in general.

Since at least one sub-answer in each candidate differs, the overall answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates both give answers for the two requested quantities (μ and λ), but their expressions for λ(θ_{n,i}(E)) are different: 

• Candidate 1: λ = (p − 1)/2 · p^{n−1} + λ(E^F,ω^{(p−1)/2+i})  
• Candidate 2: λ = λ(E^F,ω^{(p−1)/2+i})

Since these formulas are not the same, the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates give completely different algebraic expressions:

Candidate 1:  
μ(G₁+G₂; x) =  [ x (x – n₁ – n₂) ] / [ (x – n₁)(x – n₂) ] · μ(G₁, x – n₂) · μ(G₂, x – n₁)

Candidate 2:  
μ(G₁+G₂; x) = μ(G₁; x) μ(G₂; x–1) + μ(G₁; x–1) μ(G₂; x) – μ(G₁; x–1) μ(G₂; x–1)

These expressions involve different arguments of the chromatic polynomials and different multiplicative factors; they cannot be algebraically identical for general n₁, n₂, and x. Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

For a typical value (e.g., L = 6, i = 0), Candidate 1 yields (36 − 1)/(36 + 1) = 35/37 ≈ 0.946, whereas Candidate 2 yields 6^{−2} = 1/36 ≈ 0.028. Clearly the two expressions are not equal in general. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions:

• Candidate 1: ⌊(pₐ(𝒞̃) – 1)/2⌋  
• Candidate 2: (pₐ(𝒞̃) – 1)/2

Since (pₐ – 1)/2 is not always an integer (it is half-integer when pₐ is even), taking the floor changes the value in those cases. Therefore the two answers are not always the same and are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 2: m^h · s · mult(R/I)

The binomial coefficient C(h+s−1, s−1) equals s only in the special case h = 1; for general height h it is not equal to s. Therefore the two expressions differ in general and are not equivalent.

The two expressions are different generating functions.

Candidate 1: \(P_{132}(x)=\dfrac{1-x^{2}+2x^{3}}{(1-x)(1-2x^{2}-x^{4})}\).

Candidate 2: \(P_{132}(x)=\dfrac{1+x}{1-2x^{2}}\).

Expanding both into power series (or evaluating at a sample value of \(x\)) shows they give different coefficients:

• Series of Candidate 1: \(1 + x + 2x^{2} + 4x^{3} + 8x^{4} +\dots\)

• Series of Candidate 2: \(1 + x + 2x^{2} + 2x^{3} + 4x^{4} +\dots\)

The coefficient of \(x^{3}\) (and higher terms) already disagree, so the two expressions are not algebraically identical.

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The question has two sub-problems, so both candidates must give two answers.

• Candidate 1 supplies an answer for (i) (ρ_c = 2n − 1) and an answer for (ii) (a binomial expression).

• Candidate 2 provides only a single formula  \(\binom{\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}{i}\), which can at most correspond to part (ii) and gives nothing for part (i).

Because Candidate 2 omits one of the required answers, the two candidates’ outputs cannot be equivalent (Rule 2).

• Candidate 2:  (q; q³)_∞

Candidate 1 states

• 3  otherwise.

Candidate 2 states simply 
γ_{P,c}(G × K_{m₁,…,m_k}) = m₁ + m₂.

These formulas coincide only in a few special cases ((m₁,m₂) = (1,1) or (1,2)), but differ in general (e.g., for (m₁,m₂) = (2,2) Candidate 1 gives 3 whereas Candidate 2 gives 4). Since the two answers are not identical for all admissible values of m₁ and m₂, the candidates are not equivalent.

For k = 12, for example, Candidate 1 gives 8, whereas Candidate 2 gives 1792.

No solution present in one list is missing from the other, and there are no extra or differing solutions.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.  
Candidate 1 lists exactly four primitive, non-trivial solutions (one for each α, with ± z understood).  
Candidate 2 includes those four but also adds many extra tuples in which x = 0 or y = 0—these are “trivial” and therefore outside the required set. Because the answer sets differ, the candidates are inequivalent.

is not the same as Candidate 2’s expression
  \(\displaystyle \calD(Q)=\frac{Y-X}{Z}.\)

Because these formulas are plainly different and there is no indication from the problem’s definitions that they would algebraically coincide for all \(Q,a,b,X,Y,Z\), the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: \(2H_{3}-1 = 2(1+1/2+1/3)-1 = 2(1.833333…)-1 = 2.666666…\)

The two results are clearly not the same, and the general expressions differ in structure (piece-wise with a prefactor \(1/(2m-1)\) vs. a simple \(2H_m-1\)). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives 
 mult(R/I^s) = Σ_{i=1}^r (Π_{j=1}^h a_{i_j})^s.

The two formulas are structurally different:  

• Candidate 1 multiplies mult(R/I) by a binomial coefficient depending on h and s (linear in each product of exponents).  
• Candidate 2 raises each product of exponents to the power s and does not include the binomial coefficient factor.

These expressions coincide only in exceptional trivial cases (e.g., s = 1 or all products equal 0/1), not in general. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different formulas for the same quantity.

Candidate 1: mult(R/I^s) = mult(R/I) · C(h+s–1, s–1)

Candidate 2: mult(R/I^s) = s^h · mult(R/I)

The binomial coefficient C(h+s–1, s–1) equals s when h = 1, but for h ≥ 2 it is not equal to s^h (e.g., with h = 2 and s = 2, C(3,1)=3 whereas 2^2=4). Since the formulas are not the same for all h and s, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidate formulas give manifestly different expressions.

Example check at m = 1  
• Candidate 1: I(1) = −2 ln 2 + (3/2) ζ(2) = −2 ln 2 + π²/4  
• Candidate 2: I(1) = 3 ζ(3)

The two numerical values are not the same, so the formulas cannot be equivalent for general m.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different analytical expressions for Li₂(1/e^π):

• Candidate 1: a complicated combination of π², logarithms, and an unusual limit involving N(N+1) and arctan(2k).

• Candidate 2: the simple series definition  ∑_{n=1}^{∞} e^{-π n}/n².

There is no explicit derivation or statement showing these two formulas coincide, and they are not obviously the same object. Thus, under the rules, the two answers are not equivalent.

Cin(x)=∫₀ˣ(1−cos t)/t dt is an increasing function that approaches π/2 ≈ 1.570796 as x→∞.  
Hence Cin(2π) < π/2, so Cin(2π)/2 < (π/2)/2 = π/4 ≈ 0.785398.

Candidate 1’s value (Cin(2π)/2) is therefore less than 0.7854, whereas Candidate 2’s value is π/2 ≈ 1.5708.

Since 0.7854 ≠ 1.5708 (they differ by about a factor of 2), the two answers are not equal to six significant digits.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas for \(I\).

• Candidate 1: \(I=\pi\bigl(c-\sqrt{c^{2}-a^{2}}\bigr)\) – depends only on \(a\) and \(c\).

• Candidate 2: \(I=\tfrac12\,\sinh^{-1}\!\bigl(\tfrac{a}{\,b-c\,}\bigr)\) – depends on \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) (through \(b-c\)).

Because \(b\) is an independent parameter in the problem and Candidate 1’s expression is completely independent of \(b\), the two results cannot agree for arbitrary \(b>c>a>0\). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give

Candidate 1: ln | (1 + eˣ)/(2 + eˣ) | + C  
Candidate 2: ln(1 + eˣ) – ln(2 + eˣ) + C

Since ln(a) – ln(b) = ln(a/b), Candidate 2 is algebraically ln((1+eˣ)/(2+eˣ)).  
Because eˣ > 0, both 1 + eˣ and 2 + eˣ are strictly positive, so the ratio (1+eˣ)/(2+eˣ) is positive; therefore ln((1+eˣ)/(2+eˣ)) equals ln| (1+eˣ)/(2+eˣ) |. The two expressions differ only in the redundant absolute-value notation, and both include an arbitrary constant of integration.

Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

The two candidates differ only by the explicit “+ C’’ constant of integration that normally accompanies an indefinite integral.  Candidate 1 gives one representative antiderivative (with the constant implicitly taken as 0), while Candidate 2 gives the general antiderivative including the arbitrary constant.  Since any two antiderivatives differ only by such a constant, the mathematical content of the two expressions is the same.

The integral in the question is over a real interval with a real-valued integrand, so the result must be a real number.

• Candidate 1 contains explicit imaginary terms such as “i π³” and “6 i π( … )”.  
  Unless these imaginary contributions miraculously cancel (they are not paired with another “i” to yield a real quantity), the expression is intrinsically complex.  
  Moreover, it still involves polylogarithms and ζ(3) that are absent from Candidate 2.

• Candidate 2 is a simple real combination of π² and powers of ln 2.

Because Candidate 1 is (apparently) complex and structurally very different from Candidate 2, the two answers cannot represent the same real value for the integral.

The two candidates give different expressions:

Candidate 1:  (5/3) ζ(3) – (π/3) Cl₂(2π/3)

Candidate 2:  (11/9) ζ(3)

To be equivalent, we would need
 (π/3) Cl₂(2π/3)  =  (5/3 − 11/9) ζ(3)  =  (4/9) ζ(3),
i.e.
 Cl₂(2π/3) = (4/3) ζ(3)/π ≈ 0.509.

But the known numerical value of the Clausen function at 2π/3 is
 Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 0.656,
so the equality does not hold.  
Thus the two answers are not the same.

The two antiderivatives differ by a multiplicative factor  
(6/25) (3 cos x + 4 sin x)^{1/3}.  
Because (3 cos x + 4 sin x)^{1/3} is not a constant (its value changes with x), this factor cannot be absorbed into the arbitrary integration constant. Hence the two expressions are not the same antiderivative.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers give the antiderivative as

(6/25) e^{x/2} (3 cos x + 4 sin x)^{2/3} + C,

just written in two equivalent ways:

• Candidate 1: ( (3 cos x+4 sin x)^2 )^{1/3} = (3 cos x+4 sin x)^{2/3}.  
• Candidate 2: directly (3 cos x+4 sin x)^{2/3}.

Thus the two candidates are mathematically identical.

The two expressions contain very different sets of terms.

Examples of clear mismatches:
• Candidate 1 has constant terms like −120, 6 π², π⁴/30, etc.; Candidate 2 has none of these.
• Candidate 1 contains a −(π⁴/30) ln 2 term, whereas Candidate 2’s only π⁴–related term is −(π⁴/180) ln² 2.
• Candidate 1 has +24 Li₄(½) and +24 Li₅(½); Candidate 2 has 12 ln 2 Li₄(½) − 6 Li₅(½).
• Candidate 1 includes (3/5) ζ(5) (no ln 2 factor); Candidate 2 has ζ(5) ln 2 instead.
These and many other discrepancies show the results cannot be algebraically identical.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give two different explicit formulas for \(g_{ij}(\mathbf{x})\).

•  Candidate 1  
 \(g_{ij}= \dfrac{x_i x_j}{r^{2}}\phi(r)+\Bigl(\delta_{ij}-\dfrac{3x_i x_j}{r^{2}}\Bigr)\dfrac{1}{r^{3}}\int_{0}^{r}k^{2}\phi(k)\,dk\)

•  Candidate 2  
 \(g_{ij}= \dfrac{\partial^{2}\phi}{\partial r^{2}}\dfrac{x_i x_j}{r^{2}}+\dfrac{\partial\phi}{\partial r}\Bigl(\dfrac{\delta_{ij}}{r}-\dfrac{x_i x_j}{r^{3}}\Bigr)\)

These expressions are not the same.  
For instance, take a simple spherically-symmetric scalar potential that is constant, \(\phi(r)=\phi_0\):

 •  Candidate 1 then gives \(g_{ij}=(\phi_{0}/3)\,\delta_{ij}\neq 0\).  
 •  Candidate 2 gives \(g_{ij}=0\) (because both radial derivatives of a constant vanish).

Since they produce different values for the same \(\phi\), the two answers cannot be equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions for \(g_{ij}(\mathbf{x})\) are not the same.

• Candidate 1 contains both a term proportional to \(x_i x_j/r^2\) and a separate isotropic term proportional to \(\delta_{ij}\), with the latter involving an integral \(\frac{1}{r^{3}}\int_{0}^{r}k^{2}\phi(k)\,dk\).

• Candidate 2 has only the \(x_i x_j/r^2\) structure and no \(\delta_{ij}\) term, and its coefficients are written in terms of first- and second-radial derivatives of \(\phi\), not the integral that appears in Candidate 1.

Since the tensor structures and coefficient functions differ and cannot in general be transformed into one another, the answers are inequivalent.

  (highest power n³, no n⁴ term)

• Candidate 2:  I₂ = π(2n+1)⁴ / 2 = π(16 n⁴ + 32 n³ + 24 n² + 8 n + 1)/2  
  (contains an n⁴ term)

Since I₂ includes the term 16 n⁴ π/2 while I₁ has no n⁴ term, the two results cannot be equal for general n.

Both candidates give the same mathematical relationship:

• Candidate 1:  \(\ddot{\mathbf r}_j = -\dfrac{\partial \Phi_j(\mathbf r_j,t)}{\partial \mathbf r_j}\)

• Candidate 2:  \(\ddot{\mathbf r}_j = -\nabla_{\mathbf r_j}\Phi_j(\mathbf r_j,t)\) (written concisely as \(-\nabla \Phi_j\))

The gradient with respect to the position vector \(\mathbf r_j\) is exactly the vector of partial derivatives with respect to the components of \(\mathbf r_j\). Thus “\(-\partial/\partial\mathbf r_j\)” and “\(-\nabla_{\mathbf r_j}\)” denote the same operator acting on the same function, giving identical expressions for the acceleration. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for two pieces of information:
1. the unique minimum value of 𝓛(f,g), and  
2. the functions f(t) and g(t) that attain this minimum.

Candidate 1 gives both: “minimum value = 0” and “f(t)=0, g(t)=0”.
Candidate 2 only states the functions (“f(t)=0, g(t)=0”) and omits the minimum value.

Because Candidate 2 fails to provide all requested information, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidate expressions for \(I(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{t})\) are clearly different:

• Candidate 1  
\(I(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{t}) = 2 \sqrt{\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_i}{\prod_{i=1}^{n} s_i}}\;
        K_1\!\Bigl( 2\sqrt{\bigl(\sum_{i=1}^{n} t_i\bigr)\bigl(\prod_{i=1}^{n} s_i\bigr)}\Bigr).\)

• Candidate 2  
\(I(\mathbf{s},\mathbf{t}) = \displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{n} 2\,K_1\!\bigl(2\sqrt{s_i t_i}\bigr).\)

Even in the simplest case \(n=1\), Candidate 1 becomes  
\(2\sqrt{\tfrac{t_1}{s_1}}\;K_1(2\sqrt{s_1 t_1})\),  
while Candidate 2 gives  
\(2\,K_1(2\sqrt{s_1 t_1})\).

They differ by the factor \(\sqrt{t_1/s_1}\), and for \(n>1\) the discrepancy is even larger. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: \(\frac12\) (independent of \(k\)).

They coincide only at \(k=1\) (since then \(\binom{2}{1}=2\)), but differ for every other positive integer \(k\) (e.g., for \(k=2\) candidate 1 gives \(5/6\neq1/2\)). Because the question allows any positive integer \(k\), the answers are not the same in general.

The question asks for a single limiting probability that depends (in general) on the integer k.  

• Candidate 1: 1 − 1/​C(2k,k) (a function of k)  
• Candidate 2: 1/2 (a constant, independent of k)

These two expressions coincide only when k = 1; for any other k they differ. Because the answers are not the same for the general case, the candidates are inequivalent.

The two candidates propose different expressions:

Candidate 1:
(a) 0  
(b) 2/3  

Candidate 2:
“0 2/3”

Interpreting the two numbers in the same order as the two sub-problems, Candidate 2 gives 0 for (a) and 2/3 for (b). The numerical values match exactly (0.000000 vs 0.000000 and 0.666667 vs 0.666667 to six significant digits). No units are involved, and both candidates supply answers for both sub-problems.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas for the same integral:

• Candidate 1  
 I = π e^{-αβ}/(2β cos πβ) + Σ_{n=0}^{∞} (-1)^{n+1} e^{-α(n+½)}/[(n+½)^2 – β^2]

• Candidate 2  
 I = π e^{-αβ} sech(α/2) / (β cos πβ)

These are plainly not algebraically identical.  
To check numerically, take (for example) α = 1, β = 0.25 (cos πβ ≠ 0):

 Candidate 1 → I ≈ 3.78  
 Candidate 2 → I ≈ 12.3  

The results are vastly different, so the expressions are not equivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates do not give the same value for the integral.
The two candidates give clearly different mathematical expressions for the integral.

• Candidate 1: a prefactor  π e^{−αβ}/(2β cos πβ)  plus an infinite series  
  Σ_{n=0}^{∞} (−1)^{n+1} e^{−α(n+½)}/[(n+½)²−β²].

• Candidate 2: a single closed-form term  
  π e^{−αβ}/[β cos(πβ) sinh(πβ)].

Because candidate 1 contains an additional infinite series that does not appear in candidate 2, and there is no obvious identity reducing that entire series to 1/sinh(πβ), the two expressions are not the same. Hence the answers are inequivalent.

 (using the digamma recurrence relations), which gives a numerical value ≈ 0.07064.

•  Candidate 1, when the constants are worked out, also yields ≈ 0.07064.

Hence the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

• Candidate 2:  Γ(b) · M(a, 1, 1/(k − s)) / (k − s)^b

Candidate 1 contains cos(π a) and no Γ or confluent-hypergeometric function, whereas Candidate 2 contains Γ(b) and still involves the confluent hypergeometric function M(a,1,⋯). The functional forms, factors, and dependence on the parameters are plainly different, so they cannot be equivalent.

• Candidate 2: I = Γ(b) · M(a, 1, 1/(k – s)) / (k – s)^{b}

They involve different special functions (cosine and powers versus Γ(b) and the confluent hypergeometric M with different second parameter), and their overall functional dependence on the parameters a, b, k, s is entirely different. No standard identity converts one form into the other. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives “\(\dfrac{1}{2}\)”.  

Both expressions denote the same real number 0.500000 (to six significant digits).  
There are no units involved and only one answer is required.  
Hence, by Rule 4 (numeric equality) and Rule 2 (single-answer question), the two predictions are equivalent.

The two proposed results have very different functional forms.

Candidate 1  
I₁ = (√(i π)/T^{3/2}) · (√a + √b)/(√a √b) · exp[i(√a + √b)²/T]

Candidate 2  
I₂ = (2πi)/(T²(a+b)) K_{1/2}[(a+b)/T]

Using the identity K_{1/2}(z)=√(π/(2z)) e^{−z}, candidate 2 simplifies to  

I₂ = (2πi)√(π/2) T^{−3/2}(a+b)^{−3/2} e^{−(a+b)/T}.

Comparing:

• The exponential factors differ: exp[i(…)/T] vs exp[−(a+b)/T].  
• The algebraic prefactors differ: proportional to (√a+√b)/(√a √b) in one case and to (a+b)^{−3/2} in the other.  
• Numerical tests (e.g., T=1, a=b=1) give very different complex values.

Since the two expressions cannot be transformed into each other by simple algebraic or branch choices, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different analytic expressions:

• Candidate 1 contains an explicit factor e^{-b} and an infinite series involving the upper incomplete gamma function Γ( · ,b ).  
• Candidate 2 is simply (b √π / 2) {}_2F_1(½,½;1;(a/b)²) – it has no exponential or incomplete-gamma terms.

For large b (with a fixed), the integral behaves like e^{-b}.  
Candidate 1 starts with the term e^{-b}, matching this asymptotic behaviour, whereas Candidate 2 grows linearly with b (≈ b √π / 2), which is incompatible with the required exponential decay. Hence the two formulas cannot represent the same quantity.

Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.
The two expressions are clearly different.  
A quick consistency check:  
• When a → b⁻, the integral should approach ∫_{b}^{∞} e^{−x} dx = e^{−b}.  
 – Candidate 1 gives exactly e^{−b} in this limit because the prefactor (b²–a²)→0, leaving only the first term e^{−b}.  
 – Candidate 2 becomes Γ(½) e^{−b} · {}_2F_1(½,1;3/2;1).  But {}_2F_1(½,1;3/2;1) diverges (its argument equals 1 with c−a−b=0), so Candidate 2 blows up instead of tending to e^{−b}.  

Since they behave differently even in this basic limit, the two answers cannot be equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical expressions for the integral.  
• Candidate 1: \( \dfrac{2\,\operatorname{sgn}(a)}{\pi}\) (equals \(2/\pi\) if \(a>0\) and \(-2/\pi\) if \(a<0\)).  
• Candidate 2: \( \dfrac{1}{\pi}\) (independent of \(a\)).

Since \(2/\pi \neq 1/\pi\) (and \(-2/\pi \neq 1/\pi\)), the predictions are not the same. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question requires: 
1) giving the exact set of all initial values that make the sequence converge, and  
2) stating the limit attained for each such initial value.  

Candidate 1 presents a specific (though possibly incorrect) list of initial values, explicitly pairing each value (or family of values) with a limit (either 1 or –2).  
Candidate 2 only says “all nested-radical values ±√(2 ±√(2 ± …))” make the sequence converge and that “the corresponding limits are 1 and –2,” without indicating which initial values go to which limit and without listing special non-nested-radical cases (e.g., 0 or ±2) that Candidate 1 includes.

Thus the two answers give different descriptions of the convergence set and different (or at least incomplete) correspondence to limits. They are not equivalent.

The two expressions

Candidate 1: I₂(N) = π · (N − 1)(2N − 1) / (3 N²)

Candidate 2: I₂(N) = π · (N − 1) / (2 N)

are not the same function of N.  In general

( (N − 1)(2N − 1) / (3 N²) )  ≠  ( (N − 1) / (2 N) )

for most positive integers N > 1 (they coincide only at N = 2). Hence the two candidates are inequivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical limit.  

Candidate 1 gives: 1  
Candidate 2 gives: –4  

Both are plain dimensionless numbers; compare them directly (Rule 4).  
1.00000 ≠ –4.00000 up to six significant digits.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

  512 Im Li₄((1+i)/2) + (8π/3) ln²2 ln2 + 6π³ ln2 − 384 β(4)

• Candidate 2:  
  8 π β(4)

A direct numerical estimate (using accurate values for β(4), ln 2, π, and Im Li₄((1+i)/2)) shows

 Candidate 1 ≈ 25.41, Candidate 2 ≈ 24.85,

a difference of about 0.56, far larger than any conceivable rounding error.  
Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two proposed formulas for \(I_n\) are different.

Key discrepancies:
1. Candidate 1 has an additional purely imaginary term \(-\dfrac{\pi i}{2^{n+1}}\Gamma(n+1)\!\left(1-\frac1{2^{\,n+1}}\right)\zeta(n+1)\); Candidate 2 has no such term.
2. The coefficients in front of the remaining real terms differ:  
   • Candidate 1 multiplies them by \(\dfrac{1-(-1)^n}{2^{n+1}}\) or by \(1\);  
   • Candidate 2 multiplies everything by \(\dfrac1{2^{n+1}}\).  
3. The sign of the term with \(\Gamma(n+1)\zeta'(n+1)\) is opposite in the two expressions.

Because the two expressions are not algebraically identical and cannot be made identical by simple factor rearrangement, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give substantially different analytic expressions:

Candidate 1:  
    −(15/8) Li₄(½) − (7/4) ζ(3) ln 2 + 467 π⁴/23040 − 5 ln⁴2/64 + 3 π² ln²2/32

Candidate 2:  
    −π⁴/360 − (π²/12) ln²2 + ln⁴2/6

• Candidate 1 contains the constants Li₄(½) and ζ(3) ln 2 with non-zero coefficients; Candidate 2 contains neither of these terms.  
• No known identities allow Li₄(½) and ζ(3) ln 2 to cancel out exactly with the remaining terms to leave only powers of π and ln 2.  
• A direct numerical evaluation using standard values (Li₄(½)≈0.517479 …, ζ(3)≈1.202056 …, etc.) gives:

 Candidate 1 ≈ −0.0274  
 Candidate 2 ≈ −0.6271

The results differ by about 0.6, well beyond numerical uncertainty.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different closed-form expressions for the same integral.

Candidate 1:   
I(g) = (2/π) g ln g + [(g²–2)/(2π√(g²–4))] ln[(g² – g√(g²–4) – 2)/(g² + g√(g²–4) – 2)]

Candidate 2:   
I(g) = 2/(π g)

These functions of g are clearly not the same: they possess different algebraic structure (one involves g ln g and a complicated logarithmic factor, the other is a simple 1/g dependence). Substituting numerical values of g > 2 (e.g., g = 2.5, 3, 4) shows the two formulas yield different numerical results, agreeing only asymptotically for large g. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The two answers give the density in essentially the same form:

• Both express the density at a point (u, y)/(u, v) as  
  f_{X,Y}( F_X^{-1}(u), y )  /  f_X( F_X^{-1}(u) ).

• Candidate 1 multiplies by the indicator 1_{[0,1]}(u); the support of u coming from F_X already lies in [0,1], so this factor is redundant and does not change the density.

• The only notational difference is that Candidate 1 explicitly writes the “generalised inverse’’ F_X^{*-1}, while Candidate 2 writes F_X^{-1}.  In probability theory F_X^{-1} is often used for the same generalised/quantile function, so the two notations denote the same object in this context.

Hence the two expressions represent the same density; the candidates are equivalent.

Known identity: \(\displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{m}\frac{H_k}{k}=\frac12\bigl(H_m^{2}+H_m^{(2)}\bigr)\).

\(I(m)=\frac{2}{m}\sum_{k=1}^{m}\frac{H_k}{k}
      =\frac{2}{m}\cdot\frac12\bigl(H_m^{2}+H_m^{(2)}\bigr)
      =\frac{H_m^{2}+H_m^{(2)}}{m}.\)

The two candidates give completely different analytic expressions for the same principal-value integral:

Candidate 1: Re ψ(½ + ħω / (2π i kBT))  –  ln(ħω / kBT)

Candidate 2: ½ tanh(ħω / (2kBT))  –  (1/2π)[ψ(½ + ħω / (4kBT)) – ψ(½ – ħω / (4kBT))]

These formulas cannot be transformed into one another by the standard digamma reflection identity or by simple algebra. Evaluating numerically at, say, ħω/(2kBT)=0.5 gives approximately −1.96 for Candidate 1 versus −0.27 for Candidate 2, demonstrating that they yield different results. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers represent the same dimensionless quantity (an average number of coin tosses).  
Expressing Candidate 2’s value 70/9 as a decimal and rounding to six significant digits gives 7.77778, which is exactly the value written by Candidate 1.

Therefore, the two candidates’ predictions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The values are:

• Candidate 1: 1.667 → 1.66700 (to 6 significant digits, units implicit m/s)  
• Candidate 2: 5/3 m/s = 1.666666… → 1.66667 (to 6 significant digits)

Comparing the first six significant digits: 1.66700 ≠ 1.66667.  
Hence the two answers are not numerically identical, so they are not equivalent.

The required answer is a single numerical value for dy/dt (with units of m/s).

Candidate 1: 1.667  (= 1.667000 to six significant digits, unit omitted)  
Candidate 2: 5/3 m/s = 1.666666… ≈ 1.666667 to six significant digits.

Comparing the numbers to six significant digits (Rule 4):  
1.667000 ≠ 1.666667.

They are therefore different values.  
Additionally, Candidate 1 omits the unit, while Candidate 2 specifies “m/s,” giving another mismatch (Rule 1).

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical values: 

• Candidate 1: 3.00000 × 10⁻³⁶  
• Candidate 2: 1.51000 × 10⁻³⁶  

Expressed with the same exponent, the significant digits do not match to six places (3.00000 vs 1.51000). Therefore, according to Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical answers:

Candidate 1: 1.132  
Candidate 2: 1.1321

Expressed to six significant digits (Rule 4):

Candidate 1 → 1.13200  
Candidate 2 → 1.13210

They differ at the fifth significant digit (…200 vs …210), so they are not identical to six significant digits.

The question expects a single numerical dollar value.

Candidate 1 gives 88.33 (no explicit unit, but the context clearly implies dollars).
Candidate 2 gives $88.33 (explicitly dollars).

Both express the same numerical value: 88.3300 when written to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Both answers represent Euler’s number.

• Candidate 1: 2.7182818  
• Candidate 2: e = 2.718281828…  

Comparing at 6 significant digits (Rule 4):  
2.7182818 → 2.71828 (six‐digit truncation)  
e → 2.71828 (six‐digit truncation)

They match, so the two candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical values:

• Candidate 1: 0.098 (unit omitted)  
• Candidate 2: 0.386 nm

Even if we assume Candidate 1’s number is meant to be in nanometres (the required unit), 0.098 nm ≠ 0.386 nm (difference at the first significant digit). Moreover, Candidate 1’s omission of the unit introduces ambiguity (it could also be interpreted in ångströms, etc.). Therefore, by Rule 1 and Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

The answers are single numerical values.  
Expressed to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 3.46621207 → 3.46621  
• Candidate 2: 3.466 → 3.46600  

Since they differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits (3.46621 ≠ 3.46600), they do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4). Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The question requires a single numerical answer (the real root).  
Candidate 1 gives –1, i.e. –1.00000 to six significant digits.  
Candidate 2 gives –1.167, i.e. –1.16700 to six significant digits.  

Comparing the two numbers at six significant digits (Rule 4), –1.00000 ≠ –1.16700.  
Hence the candidates do not provide the same answer.

The question asks for an angle.  An angle can legitimately be expressed in either degrees or radians.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly states “7.1 degrees.”  
• Candidate 1 just gives “7.1” with no unit.  

Because more than one unit could reasonably be used here, the absence of a unit in Candidate 1 introduces ambiguity, which—according to Rule 1—means the two answers are not considered equivalent.

The question requires two numerical answers:
1. distance from object to objective (in cm)
2. magnifying power (dimensionless)

Candidate 1:  0.51 cm ,  +290  
Candidate 2:  0.5 cm ,  –300  

• Distance: 0.51 cm vs 0.5 cm → same unit and within 10 %; acceptable.

• Magnifying power: +290 vs –300  
  – The numerical values differ in sign and are not identical to 6 significant digits (290.000 vs –300.000).  
  – The rules require the numbers themselves to match; sign is part of the value unless the context explicitly ignores it, which is not stated here.

Since one of the required sub-answers does not match, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two formulas are not equivalent.

Reasoning:
• Dimensional check: In Candidate 1, Δd and L are both lengths, so Δd / L is dimensionless, whereas a wavelength must have units of length.  
• Candidate 2, (d y)/(m L), has overall units of length (length·length / length), matching a wavelength.  
• The symbols appearing in Candidate 2 (d, y, m) do not appear in Candidate 1, and there is no stated correspondence that would make Δd equal to d y / m.  

Therefore the two expressions cannot be considered the same.

Candidate 1 gives three possible widths: 
• 0.2 Å = 2 × 10⁻¹¹ m  
• 0.1 Å = 1 × 10⁻¹¹ m (twice)

Candidate 2 gives one width:  
• 10⁻¹⁰ m

After converting to the same unit, none of the three numbers from Candidate 1 (2 × 10⁻¹¹ m or 1 × 10⁻¹¹ m) matches 10⁻¹⁰ m to six significant digits.  
Moreover, Candidate 1 lists multiple distinct values while Candidate 2 lists only one, so the two answer sets do not coincide.

The question asks for four specific wavelengths.  
Both candidates give four numerical answers in nanometres, so the units and the number of items match, but we must compare each value.

Expressing all answers to six significant digits:

Candidate 1: 424 nm → 424.000 nm  
Candidate 2: 423.5 nm → 423.500 nm  

Already the first pair differs at the third significant digit (424.000 vs 423.500).  
Because Rule 4 requires equality to six significant digits for numerical comparisons, these two values are not identical. The same slight discrepancies (554 vs 553.8; 655 vs 654.5) occur for other pairs.

Since at least one of the corresponding wavelengths does not match to six significant digits, the two lists are not identical. Therefore the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for four specific wavelengths (within 400 nm–700 nm) that are most intensified.  
Both candidates list four wavelengths in nanometres, but several of the numerical values differ:

1) 424 nm  vs  423.5 nm  
2) 480 nm  vs  480 nm   (same)  
3) 554 nm  vs  553.8 nm  
4) 655 nm  vs  654.5 nm  

Under Rule 4, numerical answers are considered equivalent only if they match to six significant digits.  
424.000 and 423.500 do not match, nor do 554.000 and 553.800, nor do 655.000 and 654.500. Therefore at least two of the four sub-answers differ beyond the allowed tolerance.

Hence the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for three specific angles (first diffraction minimum, first interference minimum, first interference maximum).

Compare each sub-answer:

1. First diffraction minimum  
   • Candidate 1: θ = ± arcsin(λ / a)  
   • Candidate 2: θ =  arcsin(λ / a)  
   → Same expression (the “±” only adds the symmetric negative angle), so they match.

2. First interference minimum  
   • Candidate 1: θ = ± arcsin(λ / 6 d)  
   • Candidate 2: θ =  arcsin(λ / 2 d)  
   → Different (λ/6d vs λ/2d).

3. First interference maximum  
   • Candidate 1: θ = ± arcsin(λ / 2 d)  
   • Candidate 2: θ =  arcsin(λ / d)  
   → Different (λ/2d vs λ/d).

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question asks for all wavelengths (within 4000–7000 Å) giving maximum reflected intensity.  
Both candidates list two wavelengths, so the number of answers matches.

Comparing the numerical values:

1. 6000 Å  (Candidate 1)  vs.  6000 Å  (Candidate 2) → identical.

2. 4285 Å  (Candidate 1)  vs.  4285.7 Å  (Candidate 2)

   • Expressed to six significant digits:
     – 4285 Å → 4285.00  
     – 4285.7 Å → 4285.70  
   • They differ at the 5th significant digit (0 vs. 7), so they do NOT match to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Because at least one of the wavelength values differs beyond the allowed tolerance, the two answer sets are not identical.

The two candidates give matching results for parts (a) and (b) (expressions for RCP/LCP waves and the rotation angle θ(z)=ωβz/c), but they differ on part (c).

• Candidate 1 supplies an explicit high-frequency plasma index  
  n ± ≈ 1 − ½ ω_p²/ω² (1 ∓ ω_B/ω).

• Candidate 2 merely repeats the formal notation n_± = n ± β and states the qualitative condition ω ≫ ω_p, ω ≫ ω_c, without the explicit expression for n_±.

Because the answers must match for every sub-problem and Candidate 2 omits essential information that Candidate 1 provides for part (c), the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

• Candidate 1: a ≈ b ⁄ 8  (linear in b, has units of length)

• Candidate 2: a = 1 ⁄ (8 b³) (inversely proportional to b³, has units of 1/length³)

The expressions have incompatible dimensions and yield entirely different numerical values for any given b. Hence they are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different formulas.

• Candidate 1: 
 j = − (4 ε₀ V₀)/(9 d²) √(2 e V₀ / m) e_x
 – Units: A m⁻² (correct for a current density).

• Candidate 2: 
 J = e V₀ / d
 – Units: (C · V)/m = J/m = N (not current density).  
 – Numerically and dimensionally unrelated to Candidate 1’s expression.

Because the expressions differ algebraically and even have incompatible units, they are not equivalent.

The two candidates give formulas of the same general form (direct-charge term minus an image-charge term), but the location of the image charge differs:

• Candidate 1 uses s′ = (a² / s) s (no minus sign, and only one power of s in the denominator).

• Candidate 2 uses s′ = −(a² / |s|²) s (minus sign, and two powers of s in the denominator).

Because the vectors s′ are not the same, the denominators |r − s′| in the two potentials are different. Hence the two expressions for the potential (and likewise for part (b)) are not identical.

Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Key points:

1. Required items: The question asks for E, B, F, a in both rest and lab frames.  
   • Candidate 1 supplies explicit expressions for all four quantities in both frames.  
   • Candidate 2 gives only E and B in the rest frame and gives only rough qualitative statements (“E ≈ γ E_rest”, “B ≈ γ B_rest”) for the lab frame, omitting explicit B (it ends up zero), and omits explicit F and a altogether.  
   Hence Candidate 2 is incomplete (Rule 2).

2. Content difference: In the lab frame Candidate 1 has a non-zero magnetic field (~γ v E/c²), whereas Candidate 2 implies Bₗₐb = γ B_rest = 0 (because B_rest = 0), contradicting Candidate 1. This alone makes the answers inequivalent.

Therefore the two sets of predictions are not the same.

• Candidate 2: I = (4 π K V²) / [ln(b/a)]²

The denominators differ by a factor of ln(b/a); they are not algebraically the same except for the special (non-general) case ln(b/a)=1. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The question requires two distinct results:  
1. the electric field inside the dielectric sphere,  
2. the electric field outside the sphere.

Candidate 1:  
• Inside: \( \mathbf{E}_\text{in}= \dfrac{3\varepsilon_0}{\varepsilon+2\varepsilon_0}\,\mathbf{E}_0\)  
• Outside: \( \mathbf{E}_\text{out}= \mathbf{E}_0 + \dfrac{\varepsilon-\varepsilon_0}{\varepsilon+2\varepsilon_0} R^{3}\!\left[\dfrac{3(\mathbf{E}_0\!\cdot\!\mathbf{r})\mathbf{r}}{r^{5}}-\dfrac{\mathbf{E}_0}{r^{3}}\right]\)

Candidate 2:  
• Inside: same as above.  
• Outside: simply \( \mathbf{E}_\text{out}= \mathbf{E}_0\).

Thus the outside fields differ: Candidate 1 adds the induced-dipole term, Candidate 2 does not. Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates give the same formula for the scattered-photon energy in back-scattering (part (b)), namely  

 E′ = E / (1 + 2E/(m c²)).

However, for part (a) the question asks for the full set of conservation equations.  
• Candidate 1 supplies two independent momentum-component equations (x and y) plus the energy equation.  
• Candidate 2 writes only a single component of the momentum equation (the one along the incident-photon direction) and the energy equation, omitting the transverse component required for complete momentum conservation.

Because one sub-answer is incomplete in Candidate 2, the two candidates do not supply equivalent sets of answers for the whole problem (Rule 2).

The question asks for two separate results, (a) and (b).

Candidate 1  
(a) ρ = –P₀  
(b) **B** = 0  

Candidate 2  
(a) –ρ₀  
(b) 0  

Comparison for each sub-answer:

a)  –P₀ vs –ρ₀  
• The problem statement defines the symbol P₀; it never introduces ρ₀.  
• Since ρ₀ is undefined, we cannot assume ρ₀ = P₀.  
• Therefore the two charges are not guaranteed to be the same quantity.  
⇒ The two answers to part (a) are not unequivocally the same.

b) **B** = 0 vs 0  
• A vector zero and a scalar zero are effectively the same physical statement (“no magnetic field”), so part (b) would match.

Because Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to match for the candidates to be equivalent, and the part (a) answers differ, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem statement defines the parameter as p (coming from \(n_2 = n(1+ip)\)).  
Candidate 2’s answer is \(\arctan(2/p)\), which explicitly uses that parameter.

Candidate 1 gives \(\arctan(2/\rho)\) with a symbol ρ that is not introduced in the question.  
Because there is no explicit indication that ρ is meant to be the same quantity p, we cannot assume they are identical.

Hence the two expressions cannot be taken as unquestionably the same result.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different phase-change formulas.

• Candidate 1: φ = arctan (2 / ρ)

• Candidate 2: φ = π + arctan (2 / p)

Even if we interpret ρ and p as the same parameter, Candidate 2 has an extra additive term of π. Since a phase change is not generally defined only up to multiples of π (it is defined modulo 2π), adding π changes the physical result. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply four answers matching the four requested sub-questions.

Sub-answer comparison:
1. Frequency: 10^8 Hz vs 10^8 Hz → identical.
2. Wavelength: 3 m vs 3 m → identical.
3. Propagation direction: “positive x” vs “+x” → identical.
4. Magnetic-field direction: “z” vs “+z”.  In usual notation an unsigned axis label denotes the positive axis, so “z” and “+z” convey the same direction.

Since every corresponding sub-answer is the same, the two sets of predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for four specific items.  
Both candidates give four answers, one for each item.

Sub-answer comparison:  
(a) frequency: both give 10^8 Hz → identical.  
(b) wavelength: both give 3 m → identical.  
(c) propagation direction: both say positive x-direction → identical.  
(d) magnetic-field direction: Candidate 1 says “z”, Candidate 2 says “positive z-direction”.  Saying “z-direction” conventionally refers to the +z axis unless a negative sign is stated; thus both point along +z.  No contradiction exists.

All required answers match.

The question asks for the magnetic‐field vector in three radial regions, i.e. it expects a full vector answer (magnitude + direction).

Candidate 1 supplies:
(a) 𝐁 = 0  
(b) 𝐁 = (μ₀I/2πr)·(r²−a²)/(b²−a²)  êθ  
(c) 𝐁 = (μ₀I/2πr)  êθ  

Candidate 2 supplies:
(a) B = 0  
(b) B = μ₀I(r²−a²)/[2πr(b²−a²)]  
(c) B = μ₀I/2πr  

Thus:

• Region (a): both give 0 – matches.  
• Regions (b) and (c): magnitudes are identical, but Candidate 2 omits the azimuthal unit vector êθ, i.e. gives only a scalar magnitude, while Candidate 1 gives the full vector. Because the question requires the magnetic field itself (a vector quantity), omission of the direction is an essential missing component.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both answers provide results for all three sub-parts, so we must compare each component.

(a) Electric field  
• Candidate 1: 𝐸 = –B₀ e^{ax} sin w êₓ  – (ac/ω) B₀ e^{ax} cos w ê_y  
• Candidate 2: 𝐸 = (c B₀ k/ω) e^{ax} sin w êₓ  + (c B₀ a/ω) e^{ax} cos w ê_y  

The x-component amplitudes differ (–B₀ vs c k B₀/ω) and the y-components differ both in sign and magnitude (–ac B₀/ω vs +ac B₀/ω). These cannot be made equal by any simple identification of parameters given in the problem statement. Hence the two candidates give inequivalent electric fields.

Because one required sub-answer already disagrees, the entire sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question has three sub-parts.  
Compare each sub-answer:

(a) Current density  
• Cand 1: 𝑱 = i nₑe² 𝐄 / (mₑ ω)  
• Cand 2: 𝑱 = nₑe²τ 𝐄 / mₑ (= σ 𝐄).  
Different functional dependence (Cand 1 ∝ 1/ω, imaginary; Cand 2 ∝ τ, real). Not equivalent.

(b) Wave equation  
• Cand 1: ∇²𝐄 + (ω²/c²)(1 – ω_p²/ω²)𝐄 = 0.  
• Cand 2: ∇²𝐄 + (iωμ₀σ – ω²μ₀ε₀)𝐄 = 0.  
Forms are different; no direct algebraic equivalence. Not equivalent.

(c) Propagation condition  
• Cand 1: ω² > ω_p² (or nₑ < ε₀mₑω²/e²).  
• Cand 2: σ = 0.  
Different conditions. Not equivalent.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, overall the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 8).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.

Reasoning:

1. Sub-problem (a) (electric field):  
   • Candidate 1 does not actually provide the expressions for E; it merely refers to another problem.  
   • Candidate 2 gives explicit formulas for E inside and outside the sphere.  
   → Answers differ; Candidate 1 is incomplete.

2. Sub-problem (b) (potential):  
   • For r > R the two candidates give the same expression.  
   • For r < R the expressions differ:  
     – Candidate 1: φ = (ρ/6ε₀)(3R² − r²)  
     – Candidate 2: φ = (ρ/6ε₀)(r² + R²)  
     These are not algebraically identical except in the special case r=R, so the inside potentials disagree.

Because Candidate 1 omits the required electric-field answer and the potentials inside the sphere disagree, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
F = (e² n r)/(2 π ε₀ γ²) e_r.

Candidate 2 gives  
F = (n e² r/2)(1/ε₀ − μ₀ v²).

Using c² = 1/(μ₀ ε₀) and β = v/c, the bracket in Candidate 2 becomes  

1/ε₀ − μ₀ v² = (1 − β²)/ε₀ = 1/(ε₀ γ²).

Thus Candidate 2 simplifies to  

F = (e² n r)/(2 ε₀ γ²),

which differs from Candidate 1 by a factor of π in the denominator.  
Since the two expressions are not the same (extra factor π), the answers are not equivalent.

3. Energy density (r<R): Candidate 1 ∝ q²r²/(ε₀R⁴), Candidate 2 ∝ q²r²/(ε₀R⁸); the R-dependence is different, so they are not the same.
4. Momentum density: Candidate 1 ∝ v²/(ε₀c²), Candidate 2 ∝ v/(ε₀c⁴); they differ in both v-power and c-power.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

In Candidate 1 every term contains the appropriate factor of \(R\) [ \( (R/r), (R/r)^2, (R/r)^4 \) ], whereas Candidate 2 lacks those \(R\)-factors (effectively setting \(R=1\)). Because of this systematic discrepancy, the two potentials are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different expressions:

• Candidate 1: a position-dependent function of x and y, with two terms and no ε₀ factor.  
• Candidate 2: a single position-independent constant proportional to 1/ε₀ z₀².

The functional forms, dependence on (x,y), and presence/absence of ε₀ all differ, so the answers cannot be the same.

The two candidates give different expressions.

Candidate 1: 𝐅 = −(π / 4) μ₀ R⁴ σ² ω² ẑ  
     (magnitude coefficient = π/4 ≈ 0.785)

Candidate 2: (μ₀ σ² ω² R⁴) / 8  
     (coefficient = 1/8 = 0.125) and no direction given.

The numerical coefficients differ by a factor of 2π, and one answer is a vector (with direction −ẑ) while the other is a scalar. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The essential quantitative result required is the dipole‐field vector in spherical coordinates.  
 
• Candidate 1 gives  
 E = (p / 4π ε₀ r³) (2 cos θ  r̂ + sin θ  θ̂).

• Candidate 2 gives  
 E = (1 / 4π ε₀) [ 2 (p·r̂)/r³ r̂ + (p·θ̂)/r³ θ̂ ].  
For p along ẑ, p·r̂ = p cos θ, but p·θ̂ = –p sin θ, so Candidate 2’s expression becomes  
 E = (p / 4π ε₀ r³) (2 cos θ  r̂ – sin θ  θ̂).

Hence the θ̂ component has the opposite sign in the two answers. They therefore predict different electric fields, and the remaining parts of their answers (force, mass etc.) are also not identical.  

According to the comparison rules, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives
vₜ = (1024 m g R⁴)/(45 μ₀² μ² σ t).

Candidate 2 gives
v = (μ₀ σ μ g R²)/(2 μ₀ σ μ g R²) = ½.

• Units:  
  – Candidate 1’s expression carries physical units (m s⁻¹).  
  – Candidate 2 reduces to a pure number ½, hence dimensionless.  

Because the two answers are not the same quantity, they cannot be equivalent.

The problem asks for two separate pieces of information:

(a) the inherent mass uncertainty  
(b) the isospin I

Candidate 1 gives for (a):  Γ ≈ ħ(γ₁ + γ₂) (an energy width, no c² in the denominator)  
Candidate 2 gives for (a):  Δm = ħ(γ₁ + γ₂)/c²  (a mass width)

These two expressions are not the same physical quantity: one is in units of energy, the other in units of mass. Hence their answers to sub-problem (a) differ.

For (b) both candidates state I = 2, but Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to match; a mismatch in any sub-answer makes the whole set inequivalent.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for several sub-answers (dominant multipole for 5 transitions, a rate formula, a numerical estimate, and four rate ratios).  
Comparing the two candidates for part (a):

Transition                             Candidate 1         Candidate 2  
2p₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂                   E1                     E1            (same)  
2s₁/₂ → 1s₁/₂                   “double-photon dipole”  M1         (different)  
3d₃/₂ → 2s₁/₂                   “M1 or E2”            E2            (different)  
2p₃/₂ → 2p₁/₂                   “M1 or E2”            M1            (different/ambiguous)

Since at least three of the five multipole assignments differ, the two sets of answers are not identical.  
By Rule 2, disagreement on any required sub-answer makes the overall responses inequivalent. Additional discrepancies exist in parts (b) and (c) as well.

The problem has two sub-questions, so two answers are required:

1. Electrostatic energy of a uniformly charged sphere.
2. Radius of the mirror nuclei.

Candidate 1 supplies both:
• energy: 3 Q²/5 R  
• radius: 3.88 fm

Candidate 2 supplies only one piece of information:
• radius: 3.6 fm

Thus, according to Rule 2, Candidate 2 is missing the first required answer; moreover, for the second answer the numerical values (3.88 fm vs 3.6 fm) differ beyond 6 significant digits. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Part (a):  
  – Candidate 1 gives \( \dfrac{3Q^{2}}{5R}\).  
  – Candidate 2 gives \( \dfrac{3}{5}\dfrac{Q^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}R}\).  
  These differ by the constant factor \(1/(4\pi\varepsilon_{0})\); this is not simply a unit conversion explicitly stated, so the results are not the same.

• Part (b):  
  – Candidate 1: 3.88 fm → 3.88000 fm (to six significant digits)  
  – Candidate 2: 3.9 fm  → 3.90000 fm  
  These differ at the second decimal place and thus are not equal to six significant digits.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall answers are inequivalent.

The question asks for two things:
1. The energy required for a muon to orbit Earth.
2. Whether Earth’s magnetic field is strong enough.

Comparison of sub-answers:

1. Energy  
   • Candidate 1: 6.7 × 10⁶ MeV = 6.7 TeV.  
   • Candidate 2: 6.68 GeV.  
   These differ by a factor of 1000; they are not the same value (Rule 4).

2. Magnetic-field sufficiency  
   • Candidate 1 gives a required field of 3.49 × 10⁻³ T (≈35 G) but does not explicitly state “yes” or “no.”  
   • Candidate 2 states “No.”  
   Even if Candidate 1’s numeric value implies “no,” it is not explicitly the same form of answer, and the sub-answers do not match exactly (Rule 2).

Because both sub-answers disagree, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical answers for the same quantity (a dimensionless ratio).  
Candidate 1: 2 × 10⁷  
Candidate 2: 1 × 10⁷  

Using Rule 4, numerical answers must match to 6 significant digits when expressed with the same exponent.  
2.00000 × 10⁷ ≠ 1.00000 × 10⁷.  

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates answer all three sub-parts, so compare each sub-answer:

(a) Force  
• C1:  \(F(r) = -\dfrac{e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{3}}\,r\)  
• C2:  \(F(r) = -\dfrac{Ze^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{3}}\,r\)

For hydrogen \(Z=1\), so after inserting \(Z=1\) the two expressions coincide. Sub-answer (a) is equivalent.

(b) Type of motion  
Both say “simple harmonic motion.” Equivalent.

(c) Frequency  
• C1:  \(\omega = \sqrt{\dfrac{e^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{3}m}}\) (angular frequency)  
• C2:  \(f = \dfrac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\dfrac{Ze^{2}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}ma^{3}}}\) (ordinary frequency)

Even with \(Z=1\), C2’s result differs from C1’s by a factor \(1/2\pi\). ω (rad s⁻¹) and f (Hz) are different physical quantities; unless the factor \(2\pi\) is included, the expressions are not the same. Therefore sub-answer (c) is not equivalent.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
 ν = (Δ c² / h) (1 + Δ / 2M)

Candidate 2 gives  
 ν = Δ c² / h

The two expressions differ by the recoil-correction factor (1 + Δ / 2M). Unless Δ = 0 (which is not assumed), the results are not the same. Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

The question requires a single numerical energy value (in the same units).  

Candidate 1 gives “E = 1.92 × 10³ GeV” (≈ 1920 GeV).  
Candidate 2 gives “0.938 GeV”.

Both answers are in GeV, so units match, but the numerical values differ by orders of magnitude and do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4). Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single algebraic expression for the required incident-kaon energy.  
Writing Δ = m_Λ – m_p, note

Candidate 1: E_K = ( m_K² – m_π² + Δ² ) / [ 2 Δ ].

Candidate 2: E_K = c² ( m_π² – m_K² – (–Δ)² ) / [ 2 (–Δ) ]  
        = c² [ – ( m_K² – m_π² + Δ² ) ] / ( – 2 Δ )  
        = c² ( m_K² – m_π² + Δ² ) / [ 2 Δ ].

Thus the two expressions are identical up to the overall factor c².  
Including or omitting c² simply reflects whether one is using explicit SI units (candidate 2) or natural units with c = 1 (candidate 1). This is an allowed unit conversion (Rule 1), not a substantive difference.

Therefore the two answers are mathematically and physically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same algebraic expression except that Candidate 2 multiplies the whole result by the constant \(c^{2}\).  
This difference is purely a matter of unit convention:  

• Candidate 1 implicitly adopts natural units (\(c=1\)), so the masses are treated as energies and no extra \(c^{2}\) appears.  
• Candidate 2 keeps \(c\) explicit, converting the mass factors to energy by the usual \(E=mc^{2}\).

After accounting for this standard unit conversion, the two formulas represent the same physical quantity. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.

The question requires two answers:  
(a) β  
(b) rest energy (an energy, units of MeV)  

Sub-answer (a): both candidates give 1/3 → identical.  

Sub-answer (b):  
• Candidate 1: “136 MeV/c²” (a rest-mass, not an energy).  
• Candidate 2: “135.7 MeV” (an energy).  

1. Units differ (MeV/c² vs MeV). Rest-mass and rest-energy are physically different quantities.  
2. Even if one converts 136 MeV/c² to an energy of 136 MeV, the numerical values become 136.000 and 135.700, which differ at the third significant digit—thus not identical to 6 significant digits as required.  

Therefore the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

The question has two sub-parts, so each candidate must give two corresponding answers.

Sub-part (a)  
• C1: identifies the observable implicitly as an angular distribution and gives a specific formula  dN/dΩ = 1 − (1/3) cos θ.  
• C2: states that the observable is the angular distribution of the positron and writes the generic form  ∝ 1 + a cos θ, with ‘a’ an unspecified asymmetry parameter.

These expressions are not identical.  C1 fixes the coefficient to −1/3, whereas C2 does not specify either the value or the sign of a.  Therefore the two answers are not the same mathematical result for the distribution.

Sub-part (b)  
Both candidates state that both decays violate parity, so they match here.

Because Rule 2 requires that “each and every one of answers from both candidates are exactly identical,” and the answers to part (a) are not identical (nor guaranteed equivalent, since C2 leaves the coefficient undetermined), the two candidates are not equivalent overall.

Both candidates give 10 decay modes, one for each requested particle, so we compare each corresponding item.

1. n: p e⁻ ν̄ₑ vs. p e⁻ ν̄ₑ  → same  
2. π⁺: μ⁺ ν_μ vs. μ⁺ ν_μ  → same  
3. ρ⁰: π⁺ π⁻ vs. π⁺ π⁻  → same  
4. K⁰: π⁺ π⁻ (Candidate 1) vs. μ⁺ ν_μ (Candidate 2)  → different  
5–10: even if the rest were identical, Rule 2 says that a single discrepancy in any required sub-answer makes the whole sets inequivalent.

Because the K⁰ decay modes differ, the two answer sets are not identical.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

The question asks for a separate explanation (one answer) for EACH of the ten listed decay / reaction processes.  
• Candidate 1 supplies an answer for all ten numbered items.  
• Candidate 2 supplies answers only for items 4 and 10, and leaves the other eight items blank.  

By Rule 2, when a question requires multiple answers, any candidate that omits some of them is not equivalent to one that gives all of them. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same expression for the minimum value of \(E_\gamma-B\):

• Candidate 1 explicitly writes the equation  
 \(E_\gamma - B = \dfrac{B^2}{2Mc^2}\).

• Candidate 2 simply writes the right-hand side,  
 \(\dfrac{B^2}{2Mc^2}\).

Since the question asks for the value of \(E_\gamma-B\), providing just the value (Candidate 2) conveys the same result as writing the full equality (Candidate 1). No units or additional quantities differ. Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for TWO sub-answers (a) and (b).  
Candidate 1 supplies:

(a) 2.6 b  
(b) violation of optical theorem/ unitarity …

Candidate 2 supplies:

(a) 0 mb/sr  
(b) violation of physical limits / error in model …

For sub-answer (a) the numerical values are totally different (2.6 barn ≈ 2600 mb vs 0 mb) and the units differ. Because at least one required sub-answer does not match, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different kinds of answers and they are not compatible with each other.

• Candidate 1 supplies an absolute error, “ΔV ≈ 1 × 10⁻⁹” (presumably volts).  
• Candidate 2 supplies a relative error, “less than 1 %.”

An absolute error of 10⁻⁹ V compared with the potential at the Bohr radius (tens of volts) corresponds to a fractional error ~10⁻¹¹, which is many orders of magnitude smaller than 1 %. Because the numerical predictions are not the same and represent different measures (absolute vs. percentage), they do not agree.

Candidate 1 gives an error of “≈ 1 × 10⁻⁹” (dimensionless or in some unspecified potential units).  
Candidate 2 says the error is “less than 1 %,” i.e. < 1 × 10⁻² in fractional form.

Even if Candidate 1’s number were interpreted as a dimensionless fractional error, 10⁻⁹ ≪ 10⁻², so the two answers differ by seven orders of magnitude. They are therefore not equivalent under Rule 4/Rule 6.

The question has three sub-parts, so we must compare the candidates’ three individual answers.

(a) Diffusion coefficient  
 Candidate 1:  ħ/(2m)  
 Candidate 2:  ħ/(2m)  
 → identical.

(b) Whether the boundary is felt immediately  
 Candidate 1: boundary felt only after time elapses.  
 Candidate 2: boundary felt only after time elapses (adds timescale t ≈ l²/D).  
 → same basic answer; extra detail in candidate 2 is allowed.

(c) Range of ε_k contributing when the boundary is felt  
 Candidate 1: ε_k ≤ ħ²/(2ml²)  
 Candidate 2: ε_k ~ ħ²/(2ml²) (of order that value)  

The inequality “≤” (all energies up to that value) is not equivalent to the “∼” (energies of order that value). One includes a broad range below the threshold, while the other singles out energies around that scale. Because the two provide different ranges, their answers to part (c) differ.

Since at least one sub-answer is different, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give exactly the same algebraic expression—just with the factors written in a different order:

Candidate 1:  Eₙ = [ h α (β + 1) n E₀^β ]^{1/(1+β)}

Candidate 2:  Eₙ = [ (β + 1) α E₀^β n h ]^{1/(β+1)}

Because multiplication is commutative, the contents of the brackets are identical, and the exponents 1/(1+β) and 1/(β+1) are the same. Hence the two results are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates express the first–order correction as

 E₀ = ħω + α /√(1 + 2βħ/(mω)),

just written with different but standard notations for the harmonic-oscillator length scale:

• Candidate 1 uses α₀ ≡ √(mω/ħ), so
 α₀ α /√(α₀² + 2β) = α√(mω/ħ) /√(mω/ħ + 2β)
          = α√(mω)/(√(mω + 2βħ)).

• Candidate 2 writes the same final form directly:
 α√(mω)/(√(mω + 2βħ)).

After the obvious algebraic identification α₀² = mω/ħ, the two expressions are identical. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for separate, explicit results for three statistics (Fermi, Bose, Boltzmann) plus a qualitative comment.  
Both candidates supply results for all three cases, so we must compare each corresponding result.

1. Fermi-statistics partition function  
   • Candidate 1: \(Z_F = 1 + 2e^{-\varepsilon}+2e^{-2\varepsilon}+e^{-3\varepsilon}\).  
   • Candidate 2: \(Z_F = 1 + 4e^{-\beta\varepsilon}+e^{-3\beta\varepsilon}\).  
   The numerical coefficients of the \(e^{-\varepsilon}\) term differ (2 vs 4), and Candidate 1 has an \(e^{-2\varepsilon}\) term that Candidate 2 lacks. Hence the two answers are not the same (even disregarding the missing β).

Because at least one of the required sub-answers is different, under Rule 2 the sets of answers are not equivalent, and we need not check the remaining parts in detail.

The question asks for TWO numerical expressions: the 1 s-shift and the 2 p-shift.  
Both candidates supply two formulas, so Rule 2 applies and we must compare each pair.

1s level:  
• Candidate 1 (Gaussian units): ΔE₁ = (2 e² r_p²)/(5 a³)  
   → if converted to SI it becomes (e² r_p²)/(10 π ε₀ a³).  
• Candidate 2 (SI): ΔE₁ = (7 e² r_p²)/(30 π ε₀ a₀³).

The numerical prefactors differ: 1/10 ≈ 0.100 versus 7/30 ≈ 0.233; they cannot be made equal by unit conversion alone.

2p level:  
• Candidate 1 (Gaussian): ΔE₂ = e² r_p⁴/(1120 a⁵)  
   → in SI: e² r_p⁴/(4480 π ε₀ a⁵).  
• Candidate 2 (SI): ΔE₂ = 11 e² r_p⁴/(3360 ε₀ a₀⁵).

Again the prefactors differ strongly (1/(4480 π) ≈ 7.1 × 10⁻⁵ vs 11/3360 ≈ 3.27 × 10⁻³).

Since at least one sub-answer differs numerically (and the unit factors don’t reconcile the difference), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts and therefore expects three corresponding answers.

Comparison of the two candidates:

1. Part (a) – both simply restate the required equality, so they match here.

2. Part (b) –  
   • Candidate 1 only writes the time-independent Schrödinger eigen-equation “\(\hat H\psi = E\psi\)” without explicitly asserting the “remains stationary for all time” statement.  
   • Candidate 2 explicitly states the required result in words.  
   These are not the same answer.

3. Part (c) –  
   • Candidate 1 gives a generic expansion \(\psi(x,t)=\sum a_n\psi_n(x)e^{-iE_n t/\hbar}\) with a formula for \(a_n\).  
   • Candidate 2 gives a specific series with coefficients \( \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{n\pi} \) and only odd \(n\).  
   These expressions are different.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, Rule 2 says the overall answers are not equivalent.

The question has four sub-problems ((a), (b), (c), (d)).  
Candidate 1 supplies four separate answers; Candidate 2 also gives four.  
We must compare each corresponding sub-answer.

(a)  Clebsch–Gordan coefficient  
 • C1: coefficient = 1  
 • C2: coefficient = 1  
 → identical.

(b)  Two CG coefficients are required.  
 • C1: √(2/3) and √(1/3) (with explicit association to basis states).  
 • C2: 1/√3 and √2/√3 – the same two numbers but in the opposite order and with no indication which coefficient multiplies which basis state.  Because the ordering/basis assignment matters for CG coefficients, the two answers are not the same.

(c) & (d)  Relative reaction rates  
 • C1 gives a three-channel ratio 1 : 1 : 0 for (c) and 1 : 1 : 1 for (d), omitting the K n channels.  
 • C2 gives a single number “1” for (c) and “0” for (d).  
 → The two sets of answers clearly differ.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question asks for two numerical probabilities.  
• Candidate 1 gives: (a) 0.702 , (b) 0  
• Candidate 2 gives: (a) 512/729 , (b) 0  

For part (a):  
512/729 = 0.702332… .  
Expressing both results to six significant digits gives  
– Candidate 1: 0.702000  
– Candidate 2: 0.702332  

They differ at the fourth significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.  
For part (b) both give 0, but equivalence requires both sub-answers to match.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

For the question three separate numerical estimates are required:

(a) zero-point amplitude  
(b) tunnelling probability  
(c) some numerical measure of diffraction (e.g., angle or wavelength)

Comparison of the two candidates:

(a) 0.41 × 10⁻¹⁷ m (C1) = 4.1 × 10⁻¹⁸ m (C2)  → equivalent.  
(b) “≈ 0” (C1) vs e^(–9.34 × 10²⁹) (C2).  Although both convey “negligible”, one is an exact zero while the other is an explicit but tiny number; however even if this were accepted,  
(c) C1 supplies diffraction angles (≈ 10⁻³² rad) whereas C2 supplies a wavelength (≈ 10⁻³³ m).  These are different physical quantities with no conversion relation given, so they are not equivalent.

Because part (c) differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.
The question asks for three separate numerical estimates.

Comparison of the two candidates:

(a) Zero-point amplitude  
• Candidate 1: 0.41 × 10⁻¹⁷ m = 4.1 × 10⁻¹⁸ m  
• Candidate 2: 4.1 × 10⁻¹⁸ m  
→ Same value (equivalent).

(b) Tunnelling probability  
• Candidate 1: “T ≈ 0” (no explicit number).  
• Candidate 2: T ≈ e^(–9.34 × 10²⁹) (a specific but extremely small non-zero number).  
→ One answer is an unspecified zero/approximation; the other is a concrete non-zero value. Not identical.

(c) Diffraction quantity  
• Candidate 1: Two diffraction angles (≈1.3 × 10⁻³² rad and 9 × 10⁻³³ rad).  
• Candidate 2: A wavelength λ = 1.325 × 10⁻³² m.  
→ Different physical quantities altogether (angle vs wavelength).

The two candidates give different expressions for the same requested quantities.  

• Part (a):  
 – Candidate 1’s symmetric-top energy depends on m².  
 – Candidate 2’s expression contains K(K + 1).  m² ≠ K(K + 1) in general, so the two formulas are not the same.

• Part (b):  
 – Candidate 1 supplies energies that include an O(A) correction (extra ± Δ… term).  
 – Candidate 2 just repeats the unperturbed symmetric-top energies without any A‐dependent correction.  
 – The numerical results therefore disagree.

Both answers give the same mathematical expression once unit conventions are reconciled:

• Candidate 1 is evidently in Gaussian (cgs‐esu) units, where the Coulomb energy is e²/r.  
  Converting to SI requires replacing e² → e²/(4π ε₀):

 ΔE = (2/3) e² R²/a₀³  (Gaussian)  
   = (2/3)(e²/(4π ε₀)) R²/a₀³  (SI)  
   = e² R²/(6 π ε₀ a₀³).

• Candidate 2 already writes the result in SI units: ΔE = e² R²/(6 π ε₀ a₀³).

After the unit conversion, the two expressions coincide exactly. Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

The question explicitly asks for two things:  
1) the state at t = T, and  
2) an explanation that this state is an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian if T is “sufficiently long,” including what “sufficiently long” means.

Candidate 1 only supplies a formula for the state.  It does not discuss the adiabatic (“sufficiently long”) condition at all.

Candidate 2 supplies the same state (to first order in H_x/H_z; the global phase in Candidate 1 is physically irrelevant and the coefficients match to the required order) and also provides the required explanation of the “sufficiently long” condition.

Because Candidate 1 omits the second requested part of the answer, while Candidate 2 includes it, the responses are not equivalent under Rule 2.

The question has three sub-parts:

(a) list the possible eigenvalues (two numbers),  
(b) give the probability associated to each eigenvalue,  
(c) give the expectation value.

Thus, for (b) each probability must be linked to a specific eigenvalue.  Order therefore matters: the first probability should correspond to the first eigenvalue, the second probability to the second eigenvalue.

Candidate 1 lists the eigenvalues in the order “+ħ, 0” and then gives the probabilities “2/3” (answer 2) and “1/3” (answer 3).  
→ Mapping: +ħ → 2/3, 0 → 1/3.

Candidate 2 lists the eigenvalues in the order “0, ħ” and then gives the probabilities “2/3, 1/3”.  
→ Mapping: 0 → 2/3, ħ → 1/3.

Because the probabilities are assigned to opposite eigenvalues, the answers to part (b) are different.  Hence the two candidates are not equivalent overall.

0.160000 ≠ 0.157299 at six‐digit precision, so the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers for parts (a) and (b), so we must compare each sub-answer.

Part (a):  
|ψ(t)⟩ given by both candidates:  
cos(γBt/2)|+⟩ − sin(γBt/2)|−⟩.  
These are identical.

Part (b):  
⟨s_z⟩: both give (ħ/2) cos(γBt)  → match.  
⟨s_y⟩: both give 0  → match.  
⟨s_x⟩:  
• Candidate 1: −(ħ/2) sin(γBt)  
• Candidate 2: −ħ sin(γBt)  
These differ by a factor of 2.

Because at least one component of the required expectations differs, the two sets of answers are not identical.

The Hamiltonian involves the spin operators \( \mathbf s_i\), which have dimensions of angular momentum (and therefore carry factors of \(\hbar\)).  

Candidate 1’s four eigen-energies all contain explicit factors of \(\hbar\) and \(\hbar^{2}\):
 • \(+\hbar A + \frac{\hbar^{2}}{4}B\)  
 • \( \frac{\hbar^{2}}{4}B\)  
 • \(-\hbar A + \frac{\hbar^{2}}{4}B\)  
 • \(-\frac{3}{4}\hbar^{2}B\).

Candidate 2 lists the same algebraic structure but with every \(\hbar\) (and \(\hbar^{2}\)) omitted:
 • \(-A + B/4,\; B/4,\; A + B/4,\; -3B/4\).

Thus the two sets of values differ by overall factors of \(\hbar\) in the \(A\)-term and \(\hbar^{2}\) in the \(B\)-term.  No conversion or scaling is stated to reconcile the units, so by Rule 1 the answers are not equivalent.

The question requires two numerical/analytic answers: the first-order energy corrections for cases (a) and (b).

Candidate 1  
(a) ΔE = (λ / a) √(m ω π / ħ)  
(b) ΔE = λ / a²

Candidate 2  
(a) ΔE = λ / a  
(b) ΔE = λ / a²

For case (a), the two expressions differ by the factor √(m ω π / ħ). Because the factors are not identical (and cannot be eliminated by simple unit conversion—they contain extra physical constants), the two candidates give different results. Even though their answers for case (b) coincide, Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to match; a discrepancy in any part makes the overall sets of answers inequivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the θ-dependence of the differential cross section as an exponential of the form  

      exp[ –2 a² k² sin²(θ/2) ].

Candidate 1 writes it as exp[ –q² a²/2 ] with q = 2k sin(θ/2); candidate 2 writes it directly as exp[ –2 a² k² sin²(θ/2) ].  These are the same function of θ.

The prefactors differ (candidate 1 contains π m²A²a⁶/(4ħ⁴), candidate 2 sets the prefactor to 1), but the question requests the result only “up to a multiplicative constant.”  Hence any overall constant difference is irrelevant.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Both formulas have the same overall structure:

• Prefactor: 4 V₀² / ħ⁴ multiplied by the square of the mass (μ² in C1, m² in C2).  
  – For a nucleon scattering from a very heavy target, the reduced mass μ ≃ m, so these are the same.

• Denominator: (2k sin θ/2)⁶ in C1 equals q⁶ in C2 if one identifies q = 2k sin (θ/2), the usual momentum transfer.

• Form factor:  
  – C1: sin(2kR sin θ/2) – (2kR sin θ/2) cos(2kR sin θ/2)  
  – C2: sin(qR) – qR cos(qR)  
  With q defined above, these match exactly.

Thus, after the standard identification q = 2k sin (θ/2) and μ = m, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same differential cross-section.

Both candidates answer all three sub-parts (a), (b) and (c).  
Parts (a) and (b) give the same content:

• (a) identical normalized eigenfunctions (phase label m vs k).  
• (b) same ground-state occupancy (2 in m = 0, 4 in each of four other levels).

For part (c) they must supply two quantities: the lowest excitation energy and the corresponding wavelength.

Energy:  
Candidate 1’s formula ΔE = 9ħ²/(2mr²) equals 2.142 eV for r = 4 Å, matching Candidate 2’s 2.14 eV to six significant digits (2.14200 vs 2.14000 ×10⁰ → identical at first 6 digits).

Wavelength:  
Candidate 1: 5800 Å = 580 nm = 5.80000 ×10² nm  
Candidate 2: 579 nm = 5.79000 ×10² nm

At six significant digits 5.80000 ×10² ≠ 5.79000 ×10², so the wavelengths differ.  
Because at least one required sub-answer is different, the overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 4).

The question has four sub-parts, with part (d) explicitly asking in addition for a comment on whether the eigen­vectors are orthogonal.

• Parts (a), (b), (c): both candidates give identical numerical results.

• Part (d):
  – Both give the same set of eigenvalues and (up to overall sign and ordering) the same normalized eigenvectors, so these match.
  – However, the question also asks “Are the eigenvectors orthogonal? Comment on this.”  
    ‑ Candidate 2 answers: “Eigenvectors are not orthogonal.”  
    ‑ Candidate 1 gives no statement at all about orthogonality.

Because Candidate 1 omits a required component of the answer while Candidate 2 supplies it, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give identical answers for parts (a), (b), (c), and they list the same three eigenvalues.  
However, for part (d) their normalized eigenvectors are not the same: the third eigenvector provided by Candidate 1 differs from the second eigenvector given by Candidate 2 (they are not scalar multiples of one another).  
Furthermore, Candidate 2 explicitly states that the eigenvectors are not orthogonal, while Candidate 1 gives no comment about orthogonality.  

Because at least one required sub-answer (the full set of eigenvectors/orthogonality remark) is different, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for three pieces of information:  

1. Energy spectrum  
2. Degeneracy of each level  
3. Corresponding eigenfunctions  

Comparison:

• Energy spectrum  
  – Candidate 1: \(E = \dfrac{p_z^{2}}{2m} - \Bigl(n+\tfrac12\Bigr)\dfrac{eH_0\hbar}{mc}\).  
  – Candidate 2: \(E = \Bigl(n+\tfrac12\Bigr)\hbar\omega_c + \dfrac{n_z^{2}\pi^{2}\hbar^{2}}{2mL^{2}}\) with \(\omega_c = eH_0/m\).

  These are not the same expression: the overall sign differs, and there is an explicit \(c\) in the denominator of Candidate 1 but not in Candidate 2. Hence the two spectra are not identical.

• Degeneracy  
  – Candidate 1: gives none.  
  – Candidate 2: \(D = \dfrac{L^{2}mH_0}{2\pi\hbar}\).

  Candidate 1 omits a required answer, so the two sets of answers cannot be equivalent (Rule 2).

• Eigenfunctions  
  – Both give Landau-type wavefunctions, but disagreement on the other two required parts already makes the overall answers inequivalent.

Because (i) Candidate 1 fails to supply the degeneracy at all and (ii) the energy formulas are different, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts, so the two candidates must match in all three.

(a)  Both give the same time-reversed wavefunction: ψ*(–t).  → match.

(b)  Candidate 1:  H = (+eħ/2mc) σz Hz  
     Candidate 2:  H = – μ·Hz  

     Whether these match depends on how μ is defined.  If μ = (+eħ/2mc) σ the two differ by a minus sign; if μ = –eħ/2mc σ they agree.  Because Candidate 2 does not state the definition or sign of μ, the two answers are not unambiguously the same.  They cannot be declared identical.

(c)  Candidate 1:  dμ/dt = (e/mc) H × μ  
     Candidate 2:  dμ/dt = γ (B × μ)

     Candidate 2 leaves the coefficient as an unspecified γ, whereas Candidate 1 fixes it to e/mc; also, both use B×μ/H×μ rather than μ×B, so sign aside, the coefficients are different or at best undefined in Candidate 2.  Thus they do not match.

Because (b) and (c) are not clearly the same, the two sets of answers are not equivalent overall.

The two antiderivatives coincide if one implicitly assumes x > 0 (so that √(x²)=x), but with the standard definition √(x²)=|x| they differ for x < 0:

Candidate 1 = (1/6)(x²+4)^{3/2}/(x²|x|)  
Candidate 2 = (1/6)(x²+4)^{3/2}/x³

Since x³ = x²|x| only when x > 0, the two expressions are not identical on the whole domain x ≠ 0.  An additive constant cannot bridge this piece-wise sign difference. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives can be rewritten in a comparable form.

Candidate 2  
F₂(x) = (x² + 4)^{3/2}/(6 x³).

Candidate 1  
F₁(x) = (1/6) (4/x² + 1) √(4/x² + 1)  
      = (1/6) [(x² + 4)/x²] √[(x² + 4)/x²]  
      = (1/6) (x² + 4)^{3/2}/(x² |x|)  
      = (x² + 4)^{3/2}/(6 |x|³).

Hence
 • For x > 0: |x| = x ⇒ F₁(x) = F₂(x).  
 • For x < 0: |x| = −x ⇒ F₁(x) = −F₂(x).

Because on the negative-x region the two expressions differ by a factor −1 (not by an x-independent constant), the two candidates do not represent the same antiderivative on a common domain. Therefore they are not equivalent.
The two antiderivatives can be rewritten as  

Candidate 1: F₁(x)= 1/6 (1+4/x²)^{3/2}+C  
Candidate 2: F₂(x)= (4+x²)^{3/2}/(6x³)+C.

Since (1+4/x²)^{3/2}= (4+x²)^{3/2}/|x|³, we have  

 F₁(x)= (4+x²)^{3/2}/(6|x|³)+C.

• For x>0, |x| = x, so F₁(x)=F₂(x)+constant.  
• For x<0, |x| = –x, hence F₁(x)= –F₂(x)+constant·(x⁻ᵈ), i.e. the two expressions differ by a sign depending on x and therefore cannot differ only by a universal constant.

Moreover, differentiating shows F₂’(x)= –2 x⁻⁴ √(4+x²) for all x≠0, whereas F₁’(x) matches the integrand only when x>0.

Thus the two candidates are not equivalent antiderivatives of the given integrand.
Candidate 1 gives the antiderivative as
F₁(x)= (1/6)(1+4/x²)^{3/2}+C.

Candidate 2 gives
F₂(x)= (4+x²)^{3/2}/(6x³)+C.

Note that
(4+x²)^{3/2}=|x|³(1+4/x²)^{3/2},
so

F₂(x)= (|x|³/x³)(1/6)(1+4/x²)^{3/2}+C
      = sign(x)·F₁(x)+C.

Hence, for x>0, F₂(x)=F₁(x)+C; but for x<0, F₂(x)=−F₁(x)+C.  
The two expressions therefore differ by a non-constant factor on the negative half–line; their derivatives there have opposite signs, so they do not represent the same antiderivative on the whole domain.

Thus the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the value −24/25 (Candidate 1 writes “cos(a) = −24/25,” which clearly states that the cosine equals −24/25; Candidate 2 simply writes −24/25). The numerical result is identical to six significant digits (−0.960000). Thus the two answers are equivalent.

Both answers give an antiderivative of

∫ ((x+4)/(x-4))^{3/2} dx.

Write  

t = √(x-4) >0, u = √(x+4) > t (for x>4), s = u/t = √((x+4)/(x-4)).

1. Log term  
• Candidate 1:   –12 ln| (t – u)/(t + u) |  
• Candidate 2:   –12 ln( (s – 1)/(s + 1) ).

Since (s – 1)/(s + 1) = (u/t – 1)/(u/t + 1) = (u – t)/(u + t) = –(t – u)/(t + u), the two logarithm arguments differ only by a minus sign.  Candidate 1 uses an absolute value, so ln|…| removes that sign.  Hence the two log terms are identical (they differ, at most, by an additive constant that is absorbed in the “+ C”).

2. Algebraic term  
• Candidate 1:  s (x – 20) = (u/t)(x – 20).  
• Candidate 2:  √(x² – 16) – 16 s  
      = tu – 16 (u/t)  
      = u(t – 16/t)  
      = (u/t)(t² – 16) = (u/t)(x – 4 – 16) = (u/t)(x – 20).

Thus the algebraic parts are exactly the same.

Since both the algebraic and logarithmic parts coincide (up to the overall arbitrary constant of integration), Candidates 1 and 2 provide the same antiderivative.

Both candidates express the same solution set.

• Candidate 1 simplifies to  
 x = (π/2 − arcsin(4/5)) + 2πn = arcsin(3/5) + 2πn.  
This angle has sin x = 3/5 and cos x = 4/5.

• Candidate 2 gives  
 x = arctan(3/4) + 2πk.  
For an acute angle, tan x = 3/4 also implies sin x = 3/5 and cos x = 4/5, so the angle equals arcsin(3/5).

Both answers therefore describe exactly the same set {arcsin(3/5) + 2π ℤ}.  
Hence the predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates provide one solution for each of the seven equations in the same order.  
Converting the fractional answers in Candidate 1 to decimals gives:

1. 0 → 0  
2. 24 → 24  
3. 8 → 8  
4. 3/2 = 1.5  
5. –153/10 = –15.3  
6. 21/5 = 4.2  
7. 18 → 18  

Comparing with Candidate 2’s list:

0, 24, 8, 1.5, –15.3, 4.2, 18  

Every corresponding value is identical (Rule 4), the number of answers matches the seven sub-problems (Rule 2), and there are no unit or type mismatches (Rule 1). Therefore the two sets of answers are equivalent.

The question asks for two items:
1. Radius of convergence.
2. The complete sum of the series (i.e., its value for every \(x\) where the series converges, including \(x=0\)).

Candidate 1  
– Radius: \(R=\infty\).  
– Sum: piecewise; for \(x\neq0\) it is \(\dfrac{e^x(x-1)+1}{x^{2}}\), and it explicitly states the value at \(x=0\): \(f(0)=\tfrac12\).

Candidate 2  
– Radius: \(\infty\).  
– Sum: only \(\dfrac{e^x(x-1)+1}{x^{2}}\); no value is given for \(x=0\) (the formula gives the indeterminate form \(0/0\) there).

Thus the two sums differ at \(x=0\): Candidate 1 supplies the required value \(1/2\), while Candidate 2 leaves the function undefined at that point. Because one sub-answer (the series sum) is not identical/completely specified in both candidates, the answers are not equivalent according to Rule 2 and Rule 8.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give  
• Radius of convergence R = ∞.  
• An identical closed‐form for the series when x ≠ 0, since  
 Candidate 1: (1 + e^x(x − 1))/x²  
 Candidate 2: (1 − e^x(1 − x))/x² = (1 + e^x(x − 1))/x².

However, Candidate 1 also specifies the value of the sum at x = 0 (½) in a piecewise definition, while Candidate 2 gives no value at x = 0; the expression it provides is undefined there.  
Because the question asks for the full sum of the series and the two answers differ at x = 0, the candidates are not fully equivalent according to Rule 2/Rule 8 (one answer omits a required case).

 I₁ = ∫₀^{π/6} cos²(3θ) dθ  
 Substitute u = 3θ ⇒ dθ = du/3, limits 0→π/2:  
 I₁ = (1/3)∫₀^{π/2} cos²u du = (1/3)(π/4) = π/12.

• Candidate 2  
 I₂ = ½∫₀^{π/3} cos²(3θ) dθ  
 Substitute u = 3θ ⇒ dθ = du/3, limits 0→π:  
 I₂ = ½·(1/3)∫₀^{π} cos²u du = (1/6)(π/2) = π/12.

Both candidates ultimately evaluate to the same expression for the area.

Candidate 1:

   = 4·(π/3) + 16 ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ
   = 4π/3 + 16 ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ.

Candidate 2:
E₂ = ½[ ∫_{-π/3}^{π/3} 4 dθ + 2 ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} 16 cos²θ dθ ]
   = 2 ∫_{-π/3}^{π/3} 1 dθ + 16 ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ
   = 2·(2π/3) + 16 ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ
   = 4π/3 + 16 ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ.

Thus E₁ = E₂. The two proposed integrals give exactly the same value and represent the same region.

The two antiderivatives can be rewritten (ignoring the arbitrary integration constant) as

(2x/5)(cos + 3 sin) = (2/5)x cos + (6/5)x sin

They are identical up to the constant of integration, so the candidates are equivalent.

• (x − 9/2)² − 169/4  (since 9/2 = 4.5 and 169/4 = 42.25)

Thus the two expressions are algebraically identical.

The question asks for three separate pieces of information:

1. Degree  
2. y-intercept (a single value)  
3. Zeros (a set of three values)

Candidate 1  
1. Degree: 3  
2. y-intercept: 0, √3 − 1, −1 − √3   ← gives three numbers  
3. Zeros: 0, √3 − 1, −1 − √3  

Candidate 2  
1. Degree: 3  
2. y-intercept: 0  
3. Zeros: 0, −1 + √3, −1 − √3  (same set as candidate 1’s zeros)

The two candidates agree on the degree and on the list of zeros, but they disagree on the y-intercept: candidate 1 lists three values, whereas candidate 2 (correctly) lists only 0. Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question asks for three distinct pieces of information:

1. Degree  
2. y-intercept  
3. Zeros  

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give:

• Degree: both give 3 → same.  
• y-intercept:  
  – Candidate 1 lists three numbers “0, √3 − 1, −1 − √3”.  
  – Candidate 2 lists only “0”.  
  These are not the same.

• Zeros: both list 0, −1 + √3, −1 − √3 (order difference only) → same set, but this does not fix the mismatch in the y-intercept.

Because at least one sub-answer (the y-intercept) differs, the two overall predictions are not identical.

Candidate 1 gives 
• Length = 96 ft  
• Height ≈ 26.53 ft  

Candidate 2 gives  
• Length = 96 ft  
• Height = 8√11 ft.

Convert Candidate 2’s height to a decimal:
8√11 ≈ 26.532998 ft.

Express both heights to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 26.530000 (implicit trailing zeros)  
• Candidate 2: 26.532998.

These differ starting at the 5th significant digit, so by Rule 4 the two numerical answers are not the same.  
Since one of the two required quantities (the height) does not match, the overall answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers give the same length (96 ft), but their heights differ:

• Candidate 1: height ≈ 26.53 ft  
   → to six significant digits: 26.5300 ft

• Candidate 2: height = 8√11 ft ≈ 26.5330 ft  
   → to six significant digits: 26.5330 ft

These values differ at the 5th–6th significant digits, so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

Both answers give an integral whose numerical value is

A = ∫₀^{π/4} sin²θ dθ = π/8 − 1/4.

Candidate 1:
9 ∫₀^{π/4} sin²θ dθ = 9A.

Candidate 2:
(1/2)·9∫₀^{π/4} sin²θ dθ + (1/2)·9∫_{π/4}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ
      = (9/2)(A + B) with B = ∫_{π/4}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ
      = (9/2)(A + A) = 9A.

Since both integrals evaluate to the identical quantity 9A = (9/8)(π – 2), they represent the same area. Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

There is no difference in value, notation, units, or required components.

The two antiderivatives simplify to  

Candidate 1:  
F₁(x)= 5/128·x − 1/96 sin³(4x) − 1/256 sin(8x) − 1/2048 sin(16x) + C  

Candidate 2:  
F₂(x)= 5/64·x − 1/48 sin³(4x) − 1/128 sin(8x) − 1/1024 sin(16x) + C  

Every coefficient in F₂ is exactly twice the corresponding coefficient in F₁, i.e. F₂ = 2 F₁ (up to the same integration constant). Multiplying an antiderivative by 2 multiplies its derivative by 2, so the derivatives of F₁ and F₂ (which must reproduce the original integrand) cannot both be the same. Hence the two expressions differ by more than an additive constant and are not equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that can be rewritten into the same form up to an additive constant:

• Candidate 1:
     (½) sin(x/2) cos³(x/2) + (¾) sin(x/2) cos(x/2) + 3x/8 + C₁

• Candidate 2:
     (½) sin x + (1/16) sin 2x + 3x/8 + C₂  
  = sin(x/2) cos(x/2) + (¼) sin(x/2) cos(x/2)(cos²(x/2) – sin²(x/2)) + 3x/8 + C₂  
  = (½) cos²(x/2) sin(x/2) + (¾) sin(x/2) cos(x/2) + 3x/8 + C₂

The non-constant parts match exactly; any difference is just a constant (C₂ – C₁).

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The two expressions can be compared by rewriting Candidate 1 in the same “single-fraction” style used by Candidate 2.

Candidate 1  
 F₁(x) = −(1/9)(1 + 3/x²)^{3/2}

Rewrite the power:

(1 + 3/x²)^{3/2} = ((x²+3)/x²)^{3/2} = (x²+3)^{3/2}/|x|³.

Hence  
 F₁(x) = −(1/9)(x²+3)^{3/2}/|x|³.

Candidate 2  
 F₂(x) = −(x²+3)^{3/2}/(9x³).

So
 F₁(x) = F₂(x) for x>0,  
 F₁(x) = −F₂(x) for x<0,

i.e. the two differ by the factor sign(x) and therefore cannot differ only by an additive constant on the whole domain.  Their derivatives coincide with the integrand for positive x, but for negative x differ by a sign, so they are not the same antiderivative everywhere x≠0.

Hence the two candidates are NOT equivalent.
The two expressions are

Candidate 1:   \(-\frac19\left(1+\frac{3}{x^{2}}\right)^{3/2}+C\)

Candidate 2:   \(-\dfrac{(3+x^{2})^{3/2}}{9x^{3}}+C\)

Since \(1+\dfrac{3}{x^{2}}=\dfrac{3+x^{2}}{x^{2}}\),
 \((1+3/x^{2})^{3/2}=\dfrac{(3+x^{2})^{3/2}}{|x|^{3}}\).

Thus Candidate 1 equals
\(-\dfrac{(3+x^{2})^{3/2}}{9|x|^{3}}+C\).

Candidate 2 has denominator \(x^{3}\), not \(|x|^{3}\).  
For \(x>0\) the two expressions coincide, but for \(x<0\) they differ by a sign factor (they are negatives of one another), which is not a constant difference on the whole domain \( \mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\}\).

Therefore the two antiderivatives are not equivalent overall.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

1. Numerical value:
   • Candidate 1 gives the maximum utility as 16.715 (which, to 6 significant digits, is 16.7150).  
   • Candidate 2’s expression evaluates to 8·(12/5)^{4/5}·(6/5)^{1/5} ≈ 16.715712 (which, to 6 significant digits, is 16.7157).  
   Because Rule 4 requires agreement to 6 significant digits and 16.7150 ≠ 16.7157, the numerical answers differ.

2. Content provided:
   • Candidate 1 also supplies the maximizing point (2.4, 1.2).  
   • Candidate 2 does not explicitly give the point.  
   Even ignoring this, the mismatch in the numerical value already violates Rule 4.

Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of  
I(x) = (x-15)·√((x+3)/(x-3))  +  K·ln| (√((x+3)/(x-3)) – 1)/(√((x+3)/(x-3)) + 1) |  + C  

They agree on the first (algebraic) term, but the logarithmic coefficients differ:

• Candidate 1 coefficient:  –9  
• Candidate 2 coefficient:  –21  

Because ln|…| is not a constant function of x, changing its coefficient changes the derivative; therefore the two expressions are not the same up to an additive constant. Hence the answers are inequivalent.
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant.

1.  Non-logarithmic part  
   (x − 15)√((x+3)/(x−3))  – [–12√((x+3)/(x−3)) + √(x²−9)]  
   = (x−3)√((x+3)/(x−3)) − √(x²−9) = 0.

2.  Logarithmic part  
   Let S = √(x²−9).  Then  
   |(√(x−3)−√(x+3))/(√(x−3)+√(x+3))| = (1/3)(x−S).  
   Hence ln|…| = ln|x−S| − ln 3, so the two log terms differ by the constant 9 ln 3.

Since their difference is a constant, the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

The question asks for three distinct answers:  
1) the linear cost equation,  
2) interpretation of its slope and intercept,  
3) the cost for 687 minutes.

Comparing the two candidates:

1. Linear equation:  
   • Candidate 1: C(x) = 0.15 x + 10  
   • Candidate 2: C(x) = 0.1503 x + 9.868  
   The slope (0.150000 vs 0.150300) and intercept (10.000 vs 9.868) differ, so the equations are not identical (Rule 4).

2. Interpretation: each candidate’s interpretation matches its own equation, but because the equations themselves differ, these interpretations are not the same answer to the question.

3. Cost for 687 minutes:  
   • Candidate 1: 113.05  
   • Candidate 2: 113.14  
   These numbers differ (113.050 vs 113.140), again violating equality to six significant digits (Rule 4).

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

1. Both include the term  (1/5) √(x²+25).
2. Both include the logarithmic term (1/2) ln[(√(x²+25) − 5)/(√(x²+25)+5)], with Candidate 1 only adding absolute-value bars, which change the result at most by an additive constant (absorbed into the integration constant C).
3. Each answer ends with an arbitrary constant C.

Since the only difference is the optional absolute value—irrelevant up to the constant of integration—the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

The integrand is continuous only on each open interval between the points  
x = π/2 + k π (k ∈ ℤ).  
On any such interval we have

 arctan(tan x) = x − k π, where k is the fixed integer that labels the interval.

Hence on every connected domain where the antiderivative is defined,

 (arctan(tan x) − x) = −k π = constant.

Therefore the two expressions differ only by an additive constant ( −k π ) on every interval of definition, so they represent the same family of antiderivatives of tan⁴x.

Thus the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

The question has three sub-problems, so every answer must give three corresponding results.  
Both candidates supply three numerical costs, the inverse function, and a ppb value for \$50 000, so the structure matches.  
However, Rule 4 requires each corresponding numerical value to agree to 6 significant digits.

Cost for 40 ppb:  
• Candidate 1: 66.66666667  → 66.666667 (6 sig. fig.)  
• Candidate 2: 66.67        → 66.670000 (6 sig. fig.)  
These differ at the 4th significant digit (66.666667 ≠ 66.670000).

Cost for 50 ppb shows a similar mismatch (107.143 vs. 107.140).

Because at least one required numerical answer differs at the 6-significant-digit level, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a list of nine answers, one for each of the nine equations in the prompt.

Comparing entry-by-entry:

1. 8  =  c = 8
2. 6  =  n = 6
3. 62 =  x = 62
4. −10 = r = −10
5. 10.5 = r = 10.5
6. 4.5 = g = 9/2 = 4.5
7. 9 = m = 9
8. 3/5 = t = 3/5
9. 3/2 = m = 3/2

Every numerical value matches exactly (Rule 4), and both candidates supply an answer for every sub-problem (Rule 2). Therefore the two sets of answers are equivalent.

The two candidates give identical answers for items 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 9.

For item 5 (“intervals where the function is increasing”) they differ:

• Candidate 1:  (−∞, −6) ∪ (−2, 0) ∪ (0, ∞)  
  (The point 0 is excluded.)

• Candidate 2:  (−∞, −6) ∪ (−2, ∞)  
  (The point 0 is included.)

Thus the two descriptions are not the same set; they disagree on whether the function is classified as increasing at x = 0. Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two overall responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates simplify to exactly the same antiderivative (up to an arbitrary additive constant):

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
(1/2)x³ sin(2x) − (3/4)x sin(2x) + (3/2) sin(2x) + (3/4)x² cos(2x) − (3/8) cos(2x) + constant

Candidate 2 is  
(1/2)x³ sin(2x) − (3/4)x sin(2x) + (3/2) sin(2x) + (3/4)x² cos(2x) − (3/8) cos(2x) + C

Since they differ only by the name/absorbed value of the arbitrary constant, they represent the same indefinite integral.

The question asks to “identify the maxima and/or minima” of the given single-variable function.  For such a function, a maximum or minimum is normally specified by the point (x, y).  

• Candidate 1 supplies both coordinates: maximum at (1, 2) and minimum at (−1, −2).  
• Candidate 2 gives only the x-locations: local maximum at x = 1 and local minimum at x = −1, omitting the corresponding y-values.  

Because Candidate 2 leaves out information that is ordinarily required to specify the extrema fully, the two answers are not equally complete.  Hence they are not equivalent.
The question asks to “identify the maxima and/or minima” of the given function.  
To pin down a maximum or minimum of a single-variable function, one normally has to state

1. where it occurs (the x–value), and  
2. the corresponding function value (the y–value, i.e. the maximum/minimum itself).

Candidate 1 supplies both pieces of information, giving the full points
 • maximum at P(1, 2)  
 • minimum at P(–1, –2).

Candidate 2 mentions only the x–locations
 • local maximum at x = 1  
 • local minimum at x = –1,

omitting the y–values.  
Under Rule 2, if a required component of the answer is missing, the candidates are not equivalent. Because Candidate 2 lacks the y-values that Candidate 1 provides (and that the question implicitly requires for full identification), the two answers are not equivalent.

•  – 3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2)  
•  + C

The sets of solutions described by the two candidates are not the same.  
Candidate 2 only allows the pairs  
 (x, y) = (π/6 + nπ, π/3 + nπ) or (π/3 + nπ, π/6 + nπ).  

Candidate 1, with its two integer parameters n and k, generates additional pairs such as  
 (x, y) = (5π/6, 2π/3) (take n = 0, k = 1),  
which satisfy the equations but are not contained in Candidate 2’s list.  
Because Candidate 1 includes solutions that Candidate 2 omits, the two answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 lists two distinct families of solutions:

 • (I) x = π/3 + (π/2)(2n + k), y = π/6 + (π/2)(k – 2n)  
 • (II) x = π/6 + (π/2)(2n + k), y = π/3 + (π/2)(k – 2n)

With integers n, k these reduce (mod 2π) to

 • (I) x ≡ π/3 + (π/2)m, y ≡ π/6 + (π/2)m  
 • (II) x ≡ π/6 + (π/2)m, y ≡ π/3 + (π/2)m,

so Candidate 1 contains both the “π/3-π/6” ordering and its swapped “π/6-π/3” counterpart.

Candidate 2 gives only

 x = π/3 + (π/2)m, y = π/6 + (π/2)m,

i.e. only the first ordering.  
Thus Candidate 2’s set of solutions is a proper subset of Candidate 1’s set; the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent. Candidate 1 describes a larger family of solution pairs that includes cases with an additional “k” parameter (allowing both even and odd values), producing solutions such as (5π/6, 2π/3) that satisfy the system but are absent from Candidate 2’s more restrictive formulas. Therefore Candidate 2 provides only a subset of the solutions listed by Candidate 1. 

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates provide exactly the same two solutions to the equation: ‑2 and 6.  
The problem merely asks to “solve,” so the order is irrelevant (Rule 3); both answers list the full required set of solutions with no extras or omissions. Hence the predictions are equivalent.

The integrand can be rewritten as  

log_{a^x}(b)=ln b / (x ln a)= (ln b / ln a)·1/x,

so an antiderivative on the whole domain x≠0 is (ln b / ln a) ln|x| + C = log_a(b) ln|x| + C.

Candidate 2 gives exactly this:  log_a(b) ln|x| + C.

Candidate 1 gives (ln x)(ln b)/ln a + C = log_a(b) ln x + C, which coincides with Candidate 2 only for x>0.  
For x<0 the expression ln x is not defined, whereas the integrand is defined (and the correct antiderivative must use ln|x|).

Because Candidate 1 omits the absolute-value bars and therefore is not valid on the entire domain x≠0 specified in the problem, the two answers are not equivalent.
The two antiderivatives differ in the argument of the logarithm:

• Candidate 1: (ln x · ln b)/(ln a) + C  
 (valid only for x > 0)

• Candidate 2: (ln b)/(ln a) · ln|x| + C  
 (valid for x ≠ 0)

Because ln x and ln|x| are not the same function for x < 0 (ln x is undefined there, while ln|x| is defined), the two expressions are not identical on the whole domain allowed by the problem (x ≠ 0). Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives must differ at most by an additive constant to be equivalent.

1.  The logarithmic parts are the same, because  
    ln | (√(x-6) − √(x+6))/(√(x-6)+√(x+6)) |  
    = ln | ( √((x+6)/(x-6)) − 1 ) / ( √((x+6)/(x-6)) + 1 ) |  (they differ only by an overall − sign inside the absolute value, which vanishes).

2.  Compare the algebraic (non-log) terms:

   Candidate 1: (x − 30) √((x+6)/(x-6))

   Candidate 2: 2(x − 18) √((x+6)/(x-6))

   Difference:  [2(x − 18) − (x − 30)] √((x+6)/(x-6))
       = (x − 6) √((x+6)/(x-6))
       = √((x−6)(x+6)) = √(x² − 36),

   which is a non-constant function of x.

Because the two expressions differ by √(x² − 36), not by a constant, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 lists full coordinate pairs (x, y): (1, 1), (−2 + √3, (1 + √3)/4), (−2 − √3, (1 − √3)/4).

The question asks for “points of inflection,” which are points on the graph and therefore require both x and y values. Candidate 1 omits the y-coordinates, giving an incomplete answer, whereas Candidate 2 supplies complete points. According to Rule 2/Rule 9, an answer that omits required components is not equivalent to one that provides them.

1. x = π + 2πn              (n ∈ ℤ)
2. x = π + arctan(7/24) + 2πn (n ∈ ℤ)

Note:

arctan(7/24)  =  π − 2 arctan(7)  
⇒  π + arctan(7/24) = 2π − 2 arctan(7) = −2 arctan(7) + 2π.

Thus Candidate 2’s second family can be written as −2 arctan(7) + 2π(n+1), i.e. exactly the same set of angles as Candidate 1’s first family (just with the integer index shifted by 1). Both candidates also share the family x = π + 2πk.

Hence the two solution sets are identical.

The two candidates give answers for all nine requested items, so we compare item-by-item.

1. Domain Both intend “(−∞,−2)∪(−2,∞)” (candidate 1 writes “(−1·∞,−2)” but clearly means −∞), so item 1 agrees.
2. Vertical asymptote Both give x = −2 → agree.
3. Horizontal asymptote Both say none → agree.
4. Slant asymptote Both give y = x/5 − 4/5 → agree.

5. Increasing intervals  
 Candidate 1: (−∞,−6) ∪ (−2,0) ∪ (0,∞) (0 is excluded)  
 Candidate 2: (−∞,−6) ∪ (−2,∞) (0 is included)  
 Sets differ at the single point x = 0, so they are not identical.

6. Decreasing intervals Both: (−6,−2) → agree.
7. Concave-up intervals  
 Candidate 1: (−∞,−6) ∪ (−2,0) ∪ (0,∞)  
 Candidate 2: (0,∞) → clearly different.
8. Concave-down intervals Both list (−∞,−2) ∪ (−2,0) → agree.
9. Inflection point Both: (0,0) → agree.

Because items 5 and 7 differ, the overall sets of answers are not the same. According to Rule 2, any discrepancy in any sub-answer makes the candidates inequivalent.

Both candidates give two sub-answers (minimum and maximum), as required.

Minimum value:
• Candidate 1: 6·2^{1/3}
• Candidate 2: 3·4^{2/3}

Algebraic check:
4^{2/3} = (2^2)^{2/3} = 2^{4/3}.  
Thus 3·4^{2/3} = 3·2^{4/3}.  
Also, 6·2^{1/3} = 3·2·2^{1/3} = 3·2^{1+1/3} = 3·2^{4/3}.  
Hence both expressions are identical (≈ 7.559526).

Maximum value:
Both state that no maximum exists.

Since both sub-answers match, the candidates’ predictions are equivalent.

The two proposed Fourier series are structurally different.

• Candidate 1 gives
  φ(x) = 4 π − 8 ∑_{n=1}^∞ (sin(n x / 2) / n).

This series contains only sine terms with argument n x/2 and has no cosine terms at all.

• Candidate 2 gives
  φ(x) = 4 π + ∑_{n=1}^∞ [ 16((−1)^n − 1)/(π n²) cos(n x / 4) + 16(−1)^{n+1}/n sin(n x / 4) ].

This series contains both cosine and sine terms, the trigonometric arguments are n x/4 (half those in Candidate 1), and the cosine coefficients are non-zero for every odd n (they vanish only for even n).

Because Candidate 1 has no cosine component while Candidate 2 has non-zero cosine components, and because the sine parts use different fundamental frequencies (n x/2 vs. n x/4), the two expressions cannot be algebraically identical descriptions of the same Fourier expansion. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives simplify to  

Candidate 1:  
  I₁ = ¼ sin⁷(x/2) cos(x/2) − 1⁄24 sin⁵(x/2) cos(x/2) − 5⁄96 sin³(x/2) cos(x/2) − 5⁄64 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) + 5⁄128 x + C  

Candidate 2:  
  I₂ = ¼ sin⁷(x/2) cos(x/2) − 1⁄24 sin⁵(x/2) cos(x/2) − 5⁄96 sin³(x/2) cos(x/2) − 5⁄128 sin x + 5⁄64 x + C  

Using sin x = 2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2), the “− 5⁄64 sin(x/2) cos(x/2)” term in I₁ equals “− 5⁄128 sin x”, so those parts match.  
The only remaining difference is the x–term:

• I₁ has + 5⁄128 x  
• I₂ has + 5⁄64 x

The difference between the two results is (5⁄64 − 5⁄128) x = 5⁄128 x, which is not a constant; therefore the two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant.

Both antiderivatives can be rewritten as

Candidate 1  
= ½ cos³(2x) + 3/2 cos(2x) − 3/4 ln | (1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x−1) | + C  

Candidate 2  
= ½ cos³(2x) + 3/2 cos(2x) + 3/2 ln |tan x| + C′

Since  
1 + cos 2x = 2 cos²x, cos 2x − 1 = −2 sin²x,  
so (1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x−1) = −cot²x and, with absolute values,

ln | (1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x−1) | = ln |cot²x| = −2 ln |tan x|.

Thus  
− 3/4 ln | (1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x−1) | = (3/2) ln |tan x|.

The logarithmic parts in both expressions therefore differ only by a constant, and the polynomial parts are identical. Hence the two antiderivatives differ at most by an overall constant, meaning they are equivalent.

Both candidates give exactly the same mathematical expression, just written in a slightly different (but obviously algebraically identical) order:

Candidate 1:  S = [sin(n a/2) · cos((n+1) a/2)] / sin(a/2)

Candidate 2:  S = (sin(n a/2) / sin(a/2)) · cos((n+1) a/2)
              = [sin(n a/2) · cos((n+1) a/2)] / sin(a/2)

Because multiplying by cos((n+1)a/2) in the numerator after or before dividing by sin(a/2) yields exactly the same product/quotient, the two formulas are identical. No units or extra conditions differ. Hence the answers are equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 3.0723 → 3.07230

The two candidates give the expression

Candidate 1:  − x − 2√x − 2 ln|√x − 1|  
Candidate 2:  − 2 ln(1 − √x) − 2√x − x.

Re-ordering terms shows the only potential difference is in the logarithm:

ln|√x − 1|  versus  ln(1 − √x).

For the series to converge we require |x| < 1 (in particular, for real x we have 0 ≤ x < 1), so 0 ≤ √x < 1 and therefore 1 − √x > 0. Hence |√x − 1| = 1 − √x on the whole domain of definition, making ln|√x − 1| = ln(1 − √x).

Thus the two expressions are algebraically identical on the domain where the series is defined. Consequently, the two candidates’ answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1: −x − 2√x − 2 ln|√x − 1|  
Candidate 2: −x − 2√x − 2 ln(1 − √x)

For the series ∑_{n=1}^∞ x^{n/2+1}/(n/2+1) to converge (with real x), we need |√x| < 1, i.e. 0 ≤ x < 1. In this interval, √x < 1, so |√x − 1| = 1 − √x. Hence

ln|√x − 1| = ln(1 − √x),

making the two expressions identical on the domain where the series is defined. Thus the two candidate answers are equivalent.

The question requires 9 separate sub-answers.  
Compare each pair of sub-answers:

1. Domain  
   • Candidate 1: \((-\infty,-\tfrac23)\cup(-\tfrac23,1)\cup(\tfrac23,\infty)\)  
   • Candidate 2: \((-\infty,-\tfrac23)\cup(-\tfrac23,\tfrac23)\cup(\tfrac23,\infty)\)  
   These are different (the second interval ends at 1 vs. \(\tfrac23\)).

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two antiderivatives differ by  

(1/5) arctan(tan(10 x)) – 2 x.

Because arctan(tan θ) equals θ only up to an integer multiple of π, this difference is not a single constant; it jumps by –π/5 whenever 10 x crosses a discontinuity of tan. Hence the two expressions are not globally the same antiderivative (they coincide only on each individual branch between the vertical asymptotes of tan).

The two antiderivatives differ by  

(1/5) arctan(tan 10x) – 2x.

Because arctan(tan 10x) equals 10x minus an x-dependent multiple of π (it jumps by π whenever 10x crosses (π/2)+kπ), this difference is not a single constant on the whole real line; it changes from interval to interval. Therefore the two expressions are not the same up to an additive constant, so the candidates are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives give the same derivative

d/dx [Candidate 1] = d/dx [Candidate 2] = 2 tan⁴(10x),

so each is a correct antiderivative.  
However, to be equivalent they must differ by one global additive constant.

Difference:  
Candidate 2 − Candidate 1 = 2x − (1/5) arctan(tan 10x).

For x in an interval where −π/2 < 10x < π/2, arctan(tan 10x)=10x, so the difference is 0.  
But if 10x passes to the next branch, e.g.  π/2 < 10x < 3π/2, then arctan(tan 10x)=10x−π, giving difference π/5.  
Thus the difference depends on x and is not a single constant over ℝ.

Since they are not identical up to one constant everywhere, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for nine specific pieces of information.  
Comparing the two candidates item-by-item:

1. Domain – both give \((-\infty,\infty)\) ⇒ same.  
2. Vertical asymptotes – both say “None” ⇒ same.  
3. Horizontal asymptotes – both say “None” ⇒ same.  
4. Slant asymptote – C1: \(y=-\frac{x}{\sqrt[3]{2}}+\frac{10}{3\sqrt[3]{2}}\); C2: \(y=-\frac{x}{\sqrt[3]{2}}\) ⇒ different.  
5. Increasing intervals – both give \((0,20/3)\), but C1 gives nothing beyond that while C2 gives only that; still same here.  
6. Decreasing intervals – C1: \((-\infty,0)\cup(0,10)\); C2: \((-\infty,0)\cup(20/3,\infty)\) ⇒ different.  
7. Concave up intervals – C1: \((10,\infty)\); C2: \((0,20/3)\cup(20/3,\infty)\) ⇒ different.  
8. Concave down intervals – C1: \((-\infty,0)\cup(20/3,\infty)\); C2: \((-\infty,0)\) ⇒ different.  
9. Inflection points – C1: \((10,0)\); C2: “\(x=20/3\) and one between 0 and 20/3” ⇒ different.

Because at least one of the sub-answers differs (in fact several do), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives can be rewritten in a common form.

Let  
c = cos(2x), s = sin(2x).

Candidate 2, factored, is  
F₂(x) = –7 [ 1/(2c) + (3/4) ln|tan x| – (1/4) c/s² ] + C₂.

For Candidate 1,
•  (3/8)ln|c–1| – (3/8)ln|1+c| = (3/8)ln|(c–1)/(1+c)|  
  = (3/8)ln|tan²x| = (3/4)ln|tan x|.

•  1/[8(1+c)] + 1/[8(c–1)]  
 = (1/8)[1/(1+c) – 1/(1–c)]  
 = (1/8)[(1–c) – (1+c)] /(1–c²)  
 = –(1/4) c/s².

Thus Candidate 1 gives  
F₁(x) = –7 [ 1/(2c) + (3/4) ln|tan x| – (1/4) c/s² ] + C₁.

F₁(x) and F₂(x) differ only by the (arbitrary) constant (C₁ – C₂), so they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both candidates agree on 
• intervals of increase/decrease,  
• concave-up interval,  
• local minimum and maximum (same x–values).

However, they differ on two requested items:

1. Concave-down interval  
   – C1: (-∞,0) ∪ (0,54/11) (excludes x = 0)  
   – C2: (-∞,54/11) (includes x = 0)  
   These sets are not identical.

2. Inflection point(s)  
   – C1 gives the full point (x = 54/11, corresponding y-value).  
   – C2 lists only x = 54/11, omitting the y-coordinate that the question asks for (“inflection points” implies coordinates).  
   Hence C2 is incomplete compared with C1.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give answers for all nine requested items, and for each item their content matches:

1. Domain:  
   • Candidate 1 writes “(-1·∞, -2) ∪ (-2, 2) ∪ (2, ∞)”.  
   • Candidate 2 writes “(-∞, -2) ∪ (-2, 2) ∪ (2, ∞)”.  
   Interpreting “-1·∞” as the usual (though non-standard) way of indicating “−∞”, the two domains are identical.

2-9. For vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, slant asymptotes, increasing/decreasing intervals, concavity, and inflection points, the two candidates list exactly the same results.

Hence all sub-answers coincide; the predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for both the x-intercept and the y-intercept of the line—that is, the coordinate pairs where the graph crosses the axes.

Candidate 1 supplies each intercept as a full point:
• x-intercept: (–530/21 , 0)  
• y-intercept: (0 , 53000)

Candidate 2 lists only single numbers:
• x-intercept: –530/21  
• y-intercept: 53000

Thus Candidate 2 omits the second coordinate (the 0 for the x-intercept and the 0 for the x-coordinate of the y-intercept). Under Rule 2, if a required component of an answer is missing, the answers are not considered equivalent.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same formula for every point where x ≠ 0:

 Candidate 1:  − x /( |x| √(1 − x²)) = −sign(x)/√(1 − x²)

 Candidate 2:  −sign(x)/√(1 − x²)

However, at x = 0 the two expressions differ:

• Candidate 1 is undefined (0/0).  
• Candidate 2 gives the finite value 0 (because sign 0 = 0).

Since the two answers do not coincide at x = 0, they represent different functions.  
Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The required answer is a single numerical speed value (with units mph).

Candidate 1: 34.02 mph  → 34.0200 (to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 34.0 mph   → 34.0000 (to 6 significant digits)

Comparing the two numbers digit-by-digit (Rule 4), 34.0200 ≠ 34.0000.  
Therefore the two predictions are not identical to 6 significant digits, hence not equivalent.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give three sub-answers (degree, y-intercept, zeros).  
Compare each sub-answer:

1. Degree  
   • C1: 2  
   • C2: 2 → match.

2. y-intercept  
   • C1: “-5, 1/2” (two numbers)  
   • C2: “-5” (single number)  
   → Different.

3. Zeros  
   • C1: “-5, 1/2”  
   • C2: “-5, 1/2” → match.

Since at least one required sub-answer (the y-intercept) differs, the two sets of predictions are not identical (Rule 2 and Rule 3).

The two candidates are not equivalent. Candidate 1 gives the complex number (2 + 2 i)/15, while Candidate 2 gives the real number 2/15. These differ already at the level of having non-matching real and imaginary parts, so they cannot represent the same value.

The two answers denote the same unit (years), so we compare the numerical values.

• Candidate 1: 200/11 = 18.181818…  
  → to 6 significant digits: 18.1818

• Candidate 2: 18.18 (interpreted as 18.1800 when extended to 6 significant digits)  
  → to 6 significant digits: 18.1800

Since 18.1818 ≠ 18.1800 at the 6-significant-digit level, the two results do not match as required by Rule 4.

The question asks for two numerical values, radius (r) and height (h).

Candidate 1  
r = 3.95546093 − 2  →  1.95546093  
h = 3.95546093  

Candidate 2  
r = 1.955 m  
h = 3.955 m  

Compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• r:  
 Candidate 1 1.95546  
 Candidate 2 1.95500  
 They differ at the 5th significant digit (0 vs 4).

• h:  
 Candidate 1 3.95546  
 Candidate 2 3.95500  
 Again they differ at the 5th significant digit.

Because both required numbers fail to match to 6 significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give antiderivatives that differ in the logarithmic term:

Candidate 1 uses  
ln (1 + 5x + √(1 + (5x + 1)²)) = ln (1 + 5x + √(25x² + 10x + 2)),

whereas Candidate 2 uses  
ln (5x + 1 + √(25x² + 10x + 6)).

Because √(25x² + 10x + 2) ≠ √(25x² + 10x + 6), the two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant (their derivatives differ, so the difference is not a constant). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers represent the same numerical value to six significant digits:

• Candidate 2: 3.107 → interpreted with trailing zeros → 3.10700

Since 3.10700 equals 3.10700, the two predictions are equivalent.

Both predictions are algebraically the same:

• Candidate 1: 32 (π/2 − 1) = 16 π − 32  
• Candidate 2: 16 (π − 2)   = 16 π − 32  

Since they reduce to the identical expression 16 π − 32, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both answers simplify to the same numerical value:

Candidate 1: 32 · (π/2 − 1) = 16 π − 32  
Candidate 2: 16 (π − 2) = 16 π − 32

Since 32 · (π/2 − 1) equals 16 (π − 2), the two candidates are mathematically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that are the same up to algebraic manipulation (and hence differ at most by an additive constant):

1.  Candidate 1:  
   √(x²+1) + ½ ln | (√(x²+1) – 1)/(√(x²+1) + 1) | + C

2.  Candidate 2:  
   √(x²+1) – ln[ (1+√(x²+1))/x ] + C  
   = √(x²+1) + ln x – ln(1+√(x²+1)) + C  
   = √(x²+1) + ln [ √(x²) /(1+√(x²+1)) ] + C  
   = √(x²+1) + ln [ √(√(x²+1)-1) / √(√(x²+1)+1) ] + C  
   = √(x²+1) + ½ ln [ (√(x²+1) – 1)/(√(x²+1) + 1) ] + C.

Thus the logarithmic parts coincide exactly, so the two expressions differ only by a constant of integration. According to the rules, this means the answers are equivalent.

The two candidates both give a single numerical price (dollars), so we compare the numbers.

• Candidate 1: 101/3 = 33.666666…  
  Six-significant-digit value → 33.666667

• Candidate 2: 33.67  
  Six-significant-digit value → 33.670000

Since 33.666667 ≠ 33.670000 at six significant digits, the two answers are not identical.

The question asks for a single number (a price in dollars).  
Candidate 1 gives 101/3 = 33.666666…  
Candidate 2 gives 33.67.

Convert both to six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 → 33.6667  
• Candidate 2 → 33.6700  

Since 33.6667 ≠ 33.6700 at six-significant-digit precision (Rule 4), the two predictions are not exactly the same.

Both candidates supply answers to all seven sub-problems, and for each sub-problem the numerical values match:

1. m = –8  (identical)  
2. h = 3   (identical)  
3. t = 0.166666…  = 1/6  (equal within ≥6 significant digits)  
4. t = –3/7  (identical)  
5. y = 13  (identical)  
6. h = 10  (identical)  
7. y = –9  (identical)

Thus every corresponding answer is the same.
Both candidates give a single numerical answer for each of the 7 equations requested.

Comparing each pair:

1. m = –8  vs. –8      identical  
2. h = 3   vs. 3       identical  
3. t = 0.166666666666667 vs. 1/6:  
   • 1/6 = 0.166666…  
   • To 6 significant digits both are 0.166666 → match.  
4. t = –3/7 vs. –3/7    identical  
5. y = 13  vs. 13      identical  
6. h = 10  vs. 10      identical  
7. y = –9  vs. –9     identical  

All sub-answers coincide, so the two candidate predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates express the Taylor series as

Coefficient for (x − 1)ⁿ  =  3^{1/2−n} · (½ choose n).

Candidate 1 writes this term directly:
  ∑ 3^{1/2−n} C_{1/2}^n (x−1)ⁿ.

Candidate 2 factors out √3 (= 3^{1/2}) and writes
  √3 ∑ (½ choose n) [(x−1)/3]ⁿ
  = ∑ 3^{1/2}·3^{−n} (½ choose n) (x−1)ⁿ
  = ∑ 3^{1/2−n} (½ choose n) (x−1)ⁿ.

Thus every term in both series is identical; the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

2. Point(s) of minimum  

Candidate 1 states  
1. max → (31, 14)  
2. min → (-1033/32, -69/4)

Candidate 2 lists  
1. (-1033/32, -69/4)  
2. (31, 14)

Thus Candidate 2 gives the two points in the opposite order, implying the maximum and minimum are swapped. Since the ordered pairing of answers is required (Rule 2), the two candidates do not match.

simplifies to
 (3/2)x^{2/3} + 6 arctan(x^{1/6}) + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2’s result.  Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give two answers, matching the two sub-questions.

Sub-answer 1  
Candidate 1:  e^t / (e^t + e^x)  
Candidate 2:  e^t / (e^x + e^t)  
The numerator is identical; the denominators differ only by the order of the summands, so the expressions are the same.

Sub-answer 2 (with x = t³)  
Candidate 1: (3 t² e^{t³} + e^t)/(e^t + e^x)  
Candidate 2: (3 t² e^{t³} + e^t)/(e^{t³} + e^t)  

Given the condition x = t³, e^x = e^{t³}.  Substituting this into Candidate 1’s denominator turns it into e^{t³} + e^t, exactly the same as Candidate 2’s denominator.  The numerators are already identical.  Hence the two expressions are algebraically equivalent once the stated condition is applied.

Since both sub-answers are equivalent, the overall answers are equivalent.

All three components have opposite signs, so the vectors are negatives of each other and therefore not the same result for the projection vector requested.

The question explicitly asks for the answer in m/s, so the only reasonable unit is m/s in this context.  
Candidate 2 includes the unit (“m/s”), while Candidate 1 omits it, but the omission does not introduce any realistic ambiguity because no other unit is reasonably expected here.  
Thus the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a list of all n ≤ 20 for which a regular n-gon is constructible.  
Both candidates answer with unordered lists of integers, but they differ:

• Candidate 1: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20  
• Candidate 2: 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20

Candidate 2 includes “2,” whereas Candidate 1 does not.  
Because at least one element differs, the two answers are not the same set (Rule 3).

The question asks for one list (the minimum vertex cover).  

Candidate 1 lists six vertices: {0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9}.  
Candidate 2 lists seven vertices: {0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9}.  

Because the two sets are not identical (Candidate 2 includes vertex 5, which Candidate 1 omits), the answers are different.  By Rule 3, differing elements in the lists make the candidates inequivalent.

The question calls for a single numerical answer in MeV.  

• Candidate 1 gives “15.9” (unit not explicitly stated, but even assuming MeV this is 15.9 MeV).  
• Candidate 2 gives “265 MeV”.

Both answers are numerical, but 15.9 MeV and 265 MeV differ greatly and do not match to six significant digits (or at all). Hence they are not equivalent.

The two answers represent the same quantity only if 48.8 bits equals log₂( 52 choose 26 ).

log₂( 52 choose 26 ) ≈ 48.8283 bits.  
Candidate 1 gives 48.8 bits, which corresponds to 48.800000 when written with six significant digits.  
Comparing to 48.8283, they differ starting at the third decimal place, so they do NOT match to six significant digits (Rule 4).  

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.
The question asks for a single numerical value in bits.  

Candidate 1 gives 48.8 bits (48.8000 to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives 32.21 bits (32.2100 to six significant digits).  

The two numbers differ well beyond six significant digits, so by Rule 4 they are not the same.

The two answers are numerical values.

Convert each to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.66667 → 0.666670  
• Candidate 2: 2/3 = 0.666666… → 0.666667 (to 6 significant digits)

Comparing 0.666670 with 0.666667, they differ in the 6th significant digit (0 vs 7).  
According to Rule 4, they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers represent numerical values.

• Candidate 1 gives 0.66667.  
  – Written to six significant digits this is 0.666670.

• Candidate 2 gives 2/3.  
  – 2/3 = 0.666666…, which to six significant digits is 0.666667.

Comparing 0.666670 and 0.666667, they differ in the 6th significant digit.  
Rule 4 states the values must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two answers are numerical values: 

• Candidate 1: 0.66667  
• Candidate 2: 2/3.

Express each to six significant digits for comparison (Rule 4):

• 0.66667 → 0.666670  
• 2/3 = 0.666666…

At six significant digits these are 0.666670 vs 0.666667 (or 0.666666 if truncated). The digits do not match exactly, so the answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value in GeV.

• Candidate 1 gives 114.5 (implicit GeV).  
• Candidate 2 gives 114.6 GeV.

Expressed to six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 114.500  
Candidate 2 → 114.600

Because 114.500 ≠ 114.600 at six significant digits, the two answers are different. (The slight unit omission in Candidate 1 is acceptable, but the numerical values do not match.)

The problem expects a single numerical answer expressed in metres, with the scale “× 10⁻⁸ m”.

• Candidate 1: “1.2”  
  – No unit is written, but if interpreted per the question’s instruction it would correspond to 1.2 × 10⁻⁸ m.

• Candidate 2: “1.16 × 10⁻⁸ m”.

Numerically:
1.2 × 10⁻⁸ m = 1.20000 × 10⁻⁸ m  
1.16 × 10⁻⁸ m = 1.16000 × 10⁻⁸ m

These differ already in the third significant digit and thus do not match to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).  
Moreover, Candidate 1 omits the unit, adding ambiguity (Rule 1).

Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 2.03.  
Candidate 2 explicitly appends “bits,” while Candidate 1 provides just the number.  
Since the question requests the answer in bits and the only reasonable unit here is bits, omitting the unit does not create ambiguity—2.03 is naturally interpreted as 2.03 bits.  
The numerical values also match exactly to at least six significant digits (2.03000 vs. 2.03000).

The question asks for a period (a quantity with units of time).  
• Candidate 1 gives “2” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “2 s”, explicitly in seconds.

Because the first answer omits the unit while the second specifies one, and a period could reasonably be expressed in various time units (seconds, milliseconds, etc.), the omission introduces ambiguity. According to Rule 1, when such ambiguity exists, the answers are considered inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

The value from Candidate 2 is explicitly “10.92 %”.  
Candidate 1 gives “10.92” with no unit.

For an expected rate of return, two different unit conventions are commonly used—either a percentage (%) or a pure decimal (e.g., 0.1092). Because both conventions are plausible and Candidate 1 omits the unit, its answer is ambiguous. Under Rule 1, when multiple reasonable units exist and the omission creates ambiguity, the answers are considered inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers give the same numeric digits, but Candidate 2 explicitly states a percentage (“10.92 %”) while Candidate 1 gives “10.92” with no unit.  
For a rate of return, the quantity could reasonably be expressed either as a percentage or as a decimal fraction; omitting the unit therefore introduces ambiguity.  
Under Rule 1, when unit omission leads to ambiguity, the answers are treated as different.

The two candidates give the same numerical value (12).  
Candidate 2 explicitly writes the unit “m/s²,” while Candidate 1 omits the unit, but the problem statement itself specifies “Unit: m/s²,” so the context unambiguously fixes the unit.  
Because both answers represent the same quantity (12 m/s²), they are equivalent.

The question requires a single numerical answer “in nm.”

Candidate 2 explicitly gives 0.173 nm.  
Candidate 1 gives 0.17 with no unit stated.

1. Even if we assume Candidate 1’s value is meant to be in nm, the two numbers differ:

• Candidate 1: 0.170000  
• Candidate 2: 0.173000  

They are different at the 3rd decimal place, so they do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4).

2. Additionally, Candidate 1 omits the required unit, introducing ambiguity (Rule 1).

Because of both the numerical mismatch and the unit omission, the two predictions are not equivalent.
Candidate 1: “0.17” (unit not stated)  
Candidate 2: “0.173 nm”

1. Units  
   – The question explicitly asks for the wavelength “in nm.”  
   – Candidate 2 supplies the unit (nm).  
   – Candidate 1 omits the unit. Because wavelength could be expressed in various units (nm, Å, m, etc.), the omission introduces ambiguity. According to Rule 1, this makes the answers inequivalent.

2. Numerical value  
   – Even if we assume both are in nm, 0.170000 and 0.173000 differ at the third significant digit, so they do not match to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Since the answers differ in both unit specification and numerical value, they are not equivalent.

The two answers represent different numerical values.

• Candidate 1: –4.0  
• Candidate 2: –8 sin(2)

Using radians (the usual default for calculus problems), sin 2 ≈ 0.909297, so –8 sin 2 ≈ –7.27438, which differs from –4.00000 well beyond 6 significant digits. Even if degrees were (unusually) intended, –8 sin 2° ≈ –0.2792, still not –4. Therefore the two predictions are not equal.

Both candidates give a single numerical value.  
According to Rule 4, two real-number answers are equivalent only if they match to 6 significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 3.1415926 → 3.14159 (first 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 3.142 → 3.14200 (first 6 significant digits)

Since 3.14159 ≠ 3.14200 at the 6-significant-digit level, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the result in energy per mole, so we can compare after converting to the same unit.

Candidate 1: 7.3 kJ mol⁻¹ = 7300 J mol⁻¹ = 7.30000 × 10³ J mol⁻¹  
Candidate 2: 7281 J mol⁻¹ = 7.28100 × 10³ J mol⁻¹

Comparing the numbers to 6 significant digits:

7.30000 ≠ 7.28100

The values differ already in the second digit after the decimal point, so they are not equal to six significant figures.

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Compare the numerical values to 6 significant digits:

Candidate 1: 152.67 → 152.670  
Candidate 2: 152.68 → 152.680  

152.670 ≠ 152.680 (they differ at the 5th significant digit).  
Therefore, the answers are not identical.

Candidate 1: 131 K  → 131.000 K (to six significant digits)

Comparing the two numbers, they differ starting at the fourth significant digit, so they are not equal to six-significant-digit precision (Rule 4). Units are the same, so no unit-conversion issue (Rule 1).

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a molar volume of 1.2 in the same effective units (1 dm³ mol⁻¹ is identical to 1 L mol⁻¹ since 1 dm³ = 1 L).

• Candidate 2: 1.20 L mol⁻¹ → 1.20000 L mol⁻¹

The two answers express the temperature rise in different but directly convertible units (K vs °C). For a temperature difference, 1 K = 1 °C, so we compare the numerical values:

• Candidate 1: +37 K → 37.0000  
• Candidate 2: 36.8 °C → 36.8000  

To six significant digits these numbers differ (37.0000 ≠ 36.8000). Hence, according to Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers use convertible units:

• Candidate 1: −0.55 kJ mol⁻¹  = −550 J mol⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: −546 J mol⁻¹

Expressed with six significant digits:
• −5.50000 × 10² J mol⁻¹  
• −5.46000 × 10² J mol⁻¹  

Since −550 J mol⁻¹ and −546 J mol⁻¹ differ at the third significant digit, they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two answers differ:

• Candidate 2: −546 J mol⁻¹

Converted to the same units, −550 J mol⁻¹ vs −546 J mol⁻¹ do not match to 6 significant digits (−5.50000 × 10² vs −5.46000 × 10²).

The two candidates give the same numerical value (−111.92), but their units differ:

• Candidate 1: −111.92 kJ mol⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: −111.92 kJ  (no “per mol”)

Because the question’s other data are expressed in kJ mol⁻¹, omitting “mol⁻¹” introduces ambiguity. Under Rule 1, differing or omitted units that create ambiguity mean the answers are not equivalent.

The units can be converted:

• Candidate 1: 17 kN mol⁻¹  
 17 kN = 17 000 N, and 1 N = 1 J m⁻¹, so this equals 17 000 J (mol · m)⁻¹.

• Candidate 2: 17 173 J (mol · m)⁻¹.

After conversion both are in J (mol · m)⁻¹, so we compare the numerical values.

Expressed with six significant digits:
 Candidate 1 → 1.70000 × 10⁴  
 Candidate 2 → 1.71730 × 10⁴

These differ already at the third significant digit. Therefore, according to Rule 4, the two predictions are not the same number.

The two candidates give numerical values for the vapour pressure.

• Candidate 1: 8.7 kPa = 8.7 × 10³ Pa  
• Candidate 2: 2.09 × 10²⁸ Pa

Converting to the same unit (pascals) shows they differ by about 24 orders of magnitude, far beyond the 6-significant-digit tolerance of Rule 4. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers give numerical volumes in the same units (cm³):

Expressed to six significant digits:  
16 cm³ → 16.0000  
5.12 π cm³ → 16.0850  

These values differ already at the second decimal place, so they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

• Candidate 2: 1.226 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  

Writing both to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 1.23000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
• Candidate 2: 1.22600 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  

The significant digits differ (1.23000 vs. 1.22600), so the two values are not equal to six significant digits.

Candidate 1 gives the work function as 3.52 × 10⁻¹⁹ J.  
Candidate 2 gives it as 2.20 eV.

Converting candidate 2 to joules (1 eV ≈ 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J):

2.20 eV ≈ 2.20 × 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
    = 3.52479 × 10⁻¹⁹ J (to six significant digits).

Now compare both answers to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 3.52000 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
• Candidate 2: 3.52479 × 10⁻¹⁹ J

They differ starting at the fourth significant digit, so they are not equal to six-digit precision. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different units for the force constant.

• Candidate 1: 479 N m⁻¹  (= 479 N/m)  
• Candidate 2: 479 J/m.  Since 1 J = 1 N·m, 1 J/m = 1 N, so Candidate 2’s unit is simply Newtons.

A force constant must have units of N/m, not N. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 6.626 × 10⁻²⁵ J → 6.62600 × 10⁻²⁵ J

Expressed with the same exponent and to six significant digits, 7.00000 and 6.62600 differ already in the first digit, so they are not the same value to six-digit precision (Rule 4).

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

2.00000 × 10⁻¹⁵ J and 1.99000 × 10⁻¹⁵ J differ in the first significant digit, so they are not equal to six-significant-digit precision.

Both candidates give the same numerical value 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷ with the same power-of-ten exponent.

• Candidate 1: 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷ J electron⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷ J

The question asks for “the kinetic energy of an electron,” i.e., the energy per single electron. Saying “J electron⁻¹” or simply “J” for that single electron expresses the same physical quantity. The slight unit-notation difference does not change the value or meaning in this context.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

However, they differ in sign. Since the question asks for an amplitude (a quantity that should be non-negative), the sign is significant. Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.
The two answers must be compared numerically.

Candidate 2 gives the exact expression  
L₂ = 2 √2 · sin(π / (2 √2)).

Evaluate it:

1. 2 √2 ≈ 2 × 1.414213562 = 2.828427125  
2. π / (2 √2) = π × (1 / 2 √2) = π × 0.353553391 ≈ 1.110720735 rad  
3. sin(1.110720735) ≈ 0.896018694  
4. Product: 2.828427125 × 0.896018694 ≈ 2.5343236

Hence L₂ ≈ 2.5343236.

Candidate 1 states 2.534324263.

Compare to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1 → 2.53432 …  
• Candidate 2 → 2.53432 …

They coincide to at least the first six significant digits. Therefore the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 2.74 rad s⁻¹.  
Candidate 2 gives 0.436 Hz.

Converting Candidate 2 to radians per second:  
0.436 Hz × 2π ≈ 2.74067 rad s⁻¹.

Comparing the two angular frequencies to six significant digits:  
2.74000 rad s⁻¹ (implicit trailing zeros for Candidate 1)  
2.74067 rad s⁻¹ (from Candidate 2)  

They differ starting at the fifth significant digit, so they are not identical to six significant digits.  
Therefore, under Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value (Δv) in m/s.  
Both candidates supply one number in the same unit, so we compare the numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Candidate 1: 5275 m/s  → 5.27500 × 10³ m/s  
Candidate 2: 5200 m/s  → 5.20000 × 10³ m/s  

5.27500 × 10³ ≠ 5.20000 × 10³ at 6 significant digits, so the two answers are different.

Hence, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical answer (a distance error).  

Candidate 1: 260 m  
Candidate 2: 343 m  

Both are in the same units (metres), but the numerical values differ (260 ≠ 343). According to Rule 4, since the numbers do not match to six significant digits, the answers are not equivalent.

The answers are both in MeV, so units match (Rule 1).  
Compare numerical values to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 0.800000 MeV  
• Candidate 2: 0.782000 MeV  

Since 0.800000 ≠ 0.782000 at six-digit precision, the two predictions are different.

The question asks for a single numerical value (velocity) and both candidates provide that value in the same unit (m/s).  
Using Rule 4, compare the two numerical answers to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 15.6 m/s  →  15.6000  
• Candidate 2: 15.36 m/s →  15.3600  

15.6000 ≠ 15.3600, so the answers do not match.

Both candidates give the same angle but in different units.

• Candidate 1: 90 ° (explicitly in degrees)  
• Candidate 2: π/2 (implicitly in radians)

90 ° = π/2 radians, so after converting to the same unit the two answers coincide.

The two candidates give different explicit infinite-product/finite-product expressions.

• Candidate 1:  F = (−zq; q²)∞ / (zq; q)∞  
  = ∏_{n≥0}(1 + z q^{2n+1}) / ∏_{n≥1}(1 − z q^{n})

• Candidate 2:  F = 1/[(1−zq)(1−zq²)]

Expanding both to first order in q:

 Candidate 1: 1 + 2zq + O(q²)  
 Candidate 2: 1 + zq + O(q²)

Since the coefficients already differ at order q¹, the two functions are not the same. Thus the predictions are inequivalent.

The question asks for the (primitive) integer solutions \((x,y,z)\).  
Candidate 1 claims \((x,y,z) = (\pm 47,\,\pm 2,\,\pm 7)\).  
Candidate 2 claims \((x,y,z) = (\pm 47,\,\pm 8,\, 7)\).

The \(y\)-coordinates differ (2 vs 8) and the \(z\)-coordinate in Candidate 2 is fixed to \(+7\) rather than \(\pm 7\). Hence the two candidates list different solution sets. By Rule 2/Rule 3, answers that give different elements are not equivalent.

For m = 1 the two coincide, but the problem states “for an integer m ≥ 1” (i.e., m is arbitrary). For m ≥ 2 the two expressions are plainly unequal, so the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different expressions:

This depends on both the extension degree \(n\) and the parity of \(j\).

• Candidate 2:  \(u^{\,j}\)

This depends only on \(j\) and is independent of \(n\).

Because in general these expressions are not the same element of \(\GW(\mathbb{F}_q)\) (they already differ, for example, when \(n=1\)), the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for four separate values (cases (a)–(d)), so each candidate must give four matching answers.  

Candidate 1 gives:  
(a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 4  

Candidate 2 gives:  
(a) 2, (b) 1, (c) 1, (d) 1  

At every case the numerical results differ, so the two sets of answers are not identical.  
Hence, the candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates give different expressions:

• Candidate 1: \(r n + m - 2\)

• Candidate 2: \(m + n\)

For general integers \(m \ge 2,\; n \ge 1,\; r \ge 2\) these expressions are not equal (e.g., with \(m=2,\;n=1,\;r=2\) we get \(r n + m - 2 = 2 \cdot 1 + 2 - 2 = 2\) versus \(m + n = 3\)). Hence the predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different algebraic expressions:

• Candidate 1: r n + m − 2  
• Candidate 2: m + n − 1

These expressions are not identical for general integers r ≥ 2, n ≥ 1, m ≥ 2. Candidate 1 depends linearly on r (through the term r n) whereas Candidate 2 has no r-dependence; their constant terms also differ. Hence they cannot be equivalent except in very special cases not guaranteed by the problem’s conditions.

The question asks for TWO specific values:
1. χ(SK(n,k)^-)
2. χ(SSG(n,k)^-)

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each supply both answers, so Rule 2 applies: compare every corresponding sub-answer.

For χ(SK(n,k)^-):
• Candidate 1 gives 2n − 2k + 2.  
• Candidate 2 gives n − 1.  
These two algebraic expressions are not generally equal for integers n ≥ k (they coincide only in very special cases such as k = (n+3)/2, which is not required or stated).

For χ(SSG(n,k)^-):
• Candidate 1 gives n − k + 2.  
• Candidate 2 gives 2.  
Again, these are not generally equal (they coincide only if n − k = 0, which is not assumed).

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not the same.

Candidate 1: \(A-B-C+2\) with \(C=\binom{\,n-k-2\,}{\,k-2\,}\)

Candidate 2: \(A-B-1\)

Their difference is
\[
(A-B-C+2)-(A-B-1)=3-\binom{\,n-k-2\,}{\,k-2\,},
\]
which is not identically zero (it depends on \(n,k\)). Hence the two bounds differ except in exceptional parameter choices that are not generally true.

The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 1:  C(n-1,k-1) – C(n-k-1,k-1) – C(n-k-2,k-2) + 2  
Candidate 2:  C(n-1,k-1) – 1

Subtracting the second from the first yields  
-C(n-k-1,k-1) - C(n-k-2,k-2) + 3.

For general n ≥ 2k+1 and k ≥ 3 these extra terms are not identically zero.  
Example: k = 3, n = 7 gives

Candidate 1 = 15 – 3 – 2 + 2 = 12,  
Candidate 2 = 15 – 1 = 14.

Since the two expressions differ, the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different algebraic expressions.

Candidate 1:  C₁ = 𝑪(n−1, k−1) − 𝑪(n−k−1, k−1) − 𝑪(n−k−2, k−2) + 2  
Candidate 2:  C₂ = 𝑪(n−1, k−1) − 𝑪(n−2k+1, k−1) − 1

Take (n, k) = (7, 3):

 C₁ = 15 − 3 − 2 + 2 = 12  
 C₂ = 15 − 1 − 1 = 13

The values differ, so the formulas are not identical. Since the question requires a single numerical bound and the two candidates give non-equal answers, they are not equivalent (Rules 2, 4, 8).

The question asks for the relationship between the primal minimum  
  min φ( x )  
and the dual minimum  
  min [ f* (-Aᵀu) + g*(u) ].

Candidate 1 states that the primal minimum equals the negative of the dual minimum.  
Candidate 2 states that the two minima are equal (i.e., the same sign, not negated).

These two statements differ by a minus sign and therefore cannot be the same except in the very special situation where both minima happen to be zero. Since the problem does not impose that restriction, the candidates give different relationships.

The question requests all solvable groups whose derived length f(G) is ≤ 3.

Candidate 1 supplies a finite, explicit list of eleven particular groups.  
Candidate 2 describes an entire class: “all solvable groups with derived length at most 3,” which is an infinite collection (e.g., it would also contain the cyclic group C₅, C₆, any abelian group, many semidirect products, etc.).

Because Candidate 1’s list omits countless groups that satisfy the condition given in Candidate 2, the two answers describe different sets; they are therefore not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives an explicit, complete list of all Steklov-Lamé eigenvalues for the disk, including the formulas, the indices, and the stated multiplicities.

Candidate 2 merely writes two vague expressions, “(α_{0,n}/R)^2” and “(β_{1,n}/R)^2”, without defining α_{0,n} or β_{1,n}, without specifying multiplicities, and without covering the whole spectrum that Candidate 1 enumerates. Hence Candidate 2 is incomplete and does not match Candidate 1.

By Rules 2 and 8 the two answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ by a factor of \(n^{\,n}\).

Substituting the standard formula
\[
\omega_n=\frac{\pi^{n/2}}{\Gamma\!\bigl(\frac{n}{2}+1\bigr)}
\]
into Candidate 1 gives
\[
\frac{n^{n/2}(n+1)^{(n+1)/2}}{n!\,\omega_n}
=\frac{n^{n/2}(n+1)^{(n+1)/2}\,\Gamma\!\bigl(\tfrac{n}{2}+1\bigr)}{n!\,\pi^{n/2}},
\]
which has \(n^{n/2}\) in the numerator.

Candidate 2 has the same factors except that \(n^{n/2}\) is in the denominator:
\[
\frac{(n+1)^{(n+1)/2}\,\Gamma\!\bigl(\tfrac{n}{2}+1\bigr)}{n^{n/2}\,n!\,\pi^{n/2}}.
\]

Thus
\[
\text{Candidate 1} = n^{n}\times \text{Candidate 2},
\]
and they are not equivalent (for \(n\ge 2\) they differ; only when \(n=1\) do they coincide by accident).

(ii) χ'' = Δ + 1.

Candidate 2 gives two values—Δ + 1 and Δ + 2—but does not state which one goes with case (i) and which with case (ii). Taking the natural reading that “answer 1” corresponds to the first sub-problem (case (i)) and “answer 2” to the second (case (ii)), Candidate 2 assigns  
(i) χ'' = Δ + 1,  
(ii) χ'' = Δ + 2,

which is the reverse of Candidate 1. Therefore the two candidates give different predictions for at least one case and are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 gives only the single pattern (n = 2, D₁ = 1, D₂ = p) and a prime list {2, 3, 7, 11, 19, 43, 67, 163}, which does not match Candidate 1’s list {2, 3, 5, 7, 11}.

(ii) 9765  

Candidate 2 gives:
(i) 12600

Comparing each sub-answer:

1. 5184 ≠ 12600.  
2. 9765 ≠ \(\binom{n_1+5}{5}\) (and there is no integer \(n_1\) for which this binomial equals 9765).

• Candidate 1:  
λ(θ_{n,i}(E)) = (p − 1)/2 · p^{n−1} + q_n + { λ^+  (n even) ; λ^- (n odd) }  
(so λ depends on n, contains p^{n−1}, q_n, and parity choice)

• Candidate 2:  
λ(θ_{n,i}(E)) = λ^+ + λ^- (independent of n and parity; same for even/odd)

Because the expressions are not the same (and μ formulas, though both 0, are insufficient to make the answers match), the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single expression, 𝒮(Q).  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give two different formulas:

• Candidate 1: a long logarithmic expression that depends explicitly on Q and on a and b.  
• Candidate 2: simply states 𝒮(Q) = 𝒮 (independent of Q).

These two expressions are obviously not the same for general Q; Candidate 1 varies with Q whereas Candidate 2 is constant. Therefore, by Rule 8 (mathematical non-equivalence) and Rule 2 (single required answer differs), the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates present completely different formulas for \(\mathcal{S}(Q)\).

• Candidate 1 gives a complicated logarithmic expression depending on \(a\), \(b\) and \(Q\).

• Candidate 2 states simply \(\mathcal{S}(Q)=2\operatorname{arctanh}(\sqrt{b})\).

These expressions are not algebraically the same: plugging in generic numerical values of \(a\) and \(Q\) (e.g., \(a=\tanh(0.5)\), \(Q=2\)) yields a real value from Candidate 1 but an argument larger than 1 inside the arctanh for Candidate 2, producing a complex number. Hence the two results cannot coincide in general.

Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
 dim QP₅^{⊗ h} ≡ 3 C(h,3)+3 C(h,4)+C(h,5) (mod 2).

Because 3 ≡ 1 (mod 2), this is  
 ≡ C(h,3)+C(h,4)+C(h,5) (mod 2).

Candidate 2 gives  
 ≡ C(h+4,4) (mod 2).

For h = 1 (allowed since h ≥ 1):
 • Candidate 1: C(1,3)=C(1,4)=C(1,5)=0 ⇒ total parity 0.  
 • Candidate 2: C(5,4)=5 ⇒ parity 1.

They yield different values, so the two expressions are not equivalent.

Both candidates provide a single algebraic expression for the maximum number of edges.

Simplify Candidate 1:  
(1 − 1/k)(n² − s²)/2 + C(s,2)  
= (k-1)/(2k)·n² − (k-1)/(2k)·s² + (s(s−1))/2  
= (k-1)/(2k)·n² + (1/(2k))·s² − s/2.

Candidate 2 is  
[(k-1)n² + s² − ks]/(2k)  
= (k-1)/(2k)·n² + (1/(2k))·s² − s/2.

The two simplified expressions match term-by-term, so they are algebraically identical and therefore equivalent.

Both candidates give two pieces of information:  
1. The required orientation of f.  
2. The required similarity ratio of f.

• They agree on the similarity ratio (both say it is 1).  
• They differ on the orientation:

  – Candidate 1: “non-oblique.”  
  – Candidate 2: “orientation-preserving.”

“Non-oblique” and “orientation-preserving” are not synonymous: a non-oblique similitude could still reverse orientation (e.g., a reflection in the x-axis), whereas “orientation-preserving” excludes such reflections. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for two pieces of information: orientation and similarity ratio.  
Both candidates give “similarity ratio = 1,” but their statements about orientation differ.

• Candidate 1: “non-oblique.”  
• Candidate 2: “identity (no reflection).”

“Non-oblique” generally only rules out oblique (skew/rotated) orientations; it does not necessarily exclude reflections, whereas Candidate 2 explicitly forbids reflections and specifies the identity orientation. Since the orientation descriptions are not the same, the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: \(1/2 = 0.500000\).

The two expressions differ.

Candidate 1: F₁ = (-q²; q²)∞ / (q; q)∞  
      = (q⁴; q⁴)∞ / [(q²; q²)∞ (q; q)∞]  (using (1+q²n) = (1−q⁴n)/(1−q²n))

Candidate 2: F₂ = 1 / [(q; q)∞ (q²; q²)∞]

Thus F₁ = (q⁴; q⁴)∞ · F₂.  
The extra factor (q⁴; q⁴)∞ ≠ 1 (for generic q), so the two generating-function formulas are not identical.

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 
F₁(q)=(-q²;q²)₍∞₎ / (q;q)₍∞₎  
 = [∏_{n≥1}(1+q^{2n})] / [∏_{n≥1}(1−q^{n})].

Candidate 2: 
F₂(q)=∏_{n≥1}1/(1−q^{n}) · ∏_{n≥1}1/(1−q^{2n})  
 = 1 / [∏_{n≥1}(1−q^{n})(1−q^{2n})].

Because 1+q^{2n} = (1−q^{4n})/(1−q^{2n}), we have

F₁(q)= [∏_{n≥1}(1−q^{4n})] / [∏_{n≥1}(1−q^{2n})(1−q^{n})]  
 = [∏_{n≥1}(1−q^{4n})] · F₂(q).

The extra factor ∏_{n≥1}(1−q^{4n}) is a non-trivial q-dependent product, so F₁(q) ≠ F₂(q).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 only states that the required \(q\) lies in the intersection \(\mathcal{M}_{LD}\cap\mathcal{M}_{ED}\), without identifying which element of that intersection it is.  
• Candidate 2 specifies the concrete distribution \(q=\delta_{x_0}\) (a Dirac measure at some \(x_0\)) satisfying \(\phi(x_0)=\mathbf{u}\).

Since Candidate 2 gives an explicit description of the unique distribution while Candidate 1 merely describes a set membership, the answers differ.

Candidate 1 lists a finite collection of specific eigenvalues such as  
• 2(1 − cos(π j/n)) + m,  
• n, n + 2, m + n, 0, and two quadratic-radical expressions, each with stated multiplicities.

Candidate 2 states that every eigenvalue has the form  
 4 − 2[cos(2π j/m) + cos(2π k/n)]  
for all pairs (j,k) with 0 ≤ j ≤ m−1, 0 ≤ k ≤ n−1, with multiplicities coming from the number of pairs giving the same value.

These two sets of eigenvalues are plainly different (they are not the same formulas and do not yield the same numeric values in general), and the multiplicity descriptions also differ. Hence, by Rule 2 and Rule 8, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different formulas.  

• Candidate 1:  
  – n ≡ 0 (mod 12):  surface crossing number = 6 g (independent of n)  
  – n ≡ 6 (mod 12):  surface crossing number = 6 g − 3 (independent of n)

  – “answer 1”: 6 g · (n/12) · (n/12 − 1) (dependence on n)  
  – “answer 2”: 3 g · (n/6 − 1) (dependence on n)

Because Candidate 2’s expressions depend on n (and are clearly not equal to 6 g or 6 g − 3 except in very special trivial cases), the two candidates are not giving the same results for either congruence class. Thus, under Rule 2 and the general equivalence rules, the answers are inequivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions for both P₀₁ and P₁₀:

Candidate 1:  
P₀₁ = Γ(N_C, ν / Ω₀) / Γ(N_C)  
P₁₀ = γ(N_C, ν / Ω₁) / Γ(N_C)

Candidate 2:  
P₀₁ = γ(ν, N_C Ω₀) / Γ(ν)  
P₁₀ = γ(ν, N_C Ω₁) / Γ(ν)

The upper/lower incomplete Gamma functions are evaluated with entirely different parameter order and arguments, and the normalizing denominators also differ (Γ(N_C) vs Γ(ν)). No algebraic manipulation can equate these forms unless extra, unstated identities between N_C and ν (or Ω₀/Ω₁) hold. Hence the two sets of formulas are not the same.

Candidate 2:  
c₁(ℰ) h^{n−1} = (n − 2 δ) h^{n}

They differ in several essential ways:
• Candidate 1 contains the rank of ℰ, a factor 1/2, and a term involving K_X h^{n−1}; Candidate 2 has none of these.  
• Even if one specialised to rk ℰ = 2 and substituted a relation for K_X, the overall coefficients of h^{n} would not match Candidate 2 in general.

Thus the two expressions are not equivalent.

  – equivalent to r_∞ · p^{λ_E n + μ + ν}; r_∞ is a multiplicative factor outside the p-power, and there is no μ pⁿ term.

Because the placement of r_∞ differs and Candidate 2 lacks the μ pⁿ term that appears in Candidate 1, the two expressions are not the same.

The question requests three distinct pieces of information.  
Comparing the two candidates, we observe:

1. Part (a): both give \( \#C = p^k\). (agree)

2. Part (b):  
   • Candidate 1: “\(C\) is \(p\)-homogeneous.”  
   • Candidate 2: “\(C\) is contained in the subgroup generated by \(p^{\,n-k}\).”  
   These statements are different: being \(p\)-homogeneous is not the same as merely lying in the subgroup \( \langle p^{\,n-k}\rangle\). Thus the answers diverge on this required component.

3. Part (c):  
   • Candidate 1 gives \(I=\{j_1-1,\dots ,j_k-1\}\).  
   • Candidate 2 gives \(I=\{j_1,\dots ,j_k\}\).  
   The two sets are not identical.

Because at least one sub-answer differs (indeed, both (b) and (c) differ), Rule 2 dictates the two overall predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for three separate pieces of information:  
(a) the cardinality #C,  
(b) whether C is p-homogeneous (a specific property), and  
(c) the index set I that describes the tree 𝒯_C.

Comparison of the two candidates:

1. Part (a): Both give #C = p^k → identical.

2. Part (b):  
   • Candidate 1 explicitly states “C is p-homogeneous.”  
   • Candidate 2 says “C is a union of cosets of a subgroup of ℤ/p^nℤ.”  
   These are not the same statement: being a union of cosets is more general and does not necessarily imply the specific p-homogeneity property required by the problem. Hence the answers differ for part (b).

3. Part (c):  
   • Candidate 1: I = {j₁−1, …, j_k−1}.  
   • Candidate 2: I = {j₁, …, j_k}.  
   The two sets differ by a shift of 1 for every element, so the answers are not the same.

Because they disagree on both (b) and (c), the two candidates are not equivalent overall.

• Candidate 1:  n! e^{x+y} / (e^{x}+e^{y}-e^{x+y})^{\,n+1}  
• Candidate 2:  e^{\,y+\frac{n x}{2}}

If we set x = 0 and y = 0,
 Candidate 1 gives n! (because the denominator equals 1),
 Candidate 2 gives 1.

For n ≥ 2 these numbers are unequal (n! ≠ 1).  
Since the two expressions are not identically the same function of x, y, and n, the candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are structurally very different:

Candidate 1: (n!) e^{x+y} / (e^{x}+e^{y}-e^{x+y})^{\,n+1}

• Rational function in the exponentials e^{x} and e^{y}.  
• Denominator depends on both x and y through e^{x}, e^{y}, and their product.  
• No negative powers of x appear inside any exponent.

Candidate 2: e^{\,\frac{n}{2}(x-\frac{1}{x})}\,e^{y}

• Pure exponential factorised as e^{y} times e^{\frac{n}{2}(x-1/x)}.  
• Contains 1/x inside the exponent (a negative power of x), which never occurs in Candidate 1.  
• Has no dependence on e^{x+y} or any combination like e^{x}+e^{y}-e^{x+y}.

Because the functional dependence on x and y is fundamentally different (one involves a rational expression of exponentials in x and y, the other an exponential that even contains 1/x), the two formulae cannot coincide for general x, y, n. Hence they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give entirely different closed-form expressions.

• For n = 0  
 – Candidate 1 yields e^{x+y}/(e^{x}+e^{y}-e^{x+y}).  
 – Candidate 2 yields e^{0} = 1.  
These are unequal for generic x, y.

Since the expressions already disagree for the same parameter value, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions:

• Candidate 1: \(b(S) = \binom{r}{\frac{r+1}{2}}\)  
• Candidate 2: \(b(S) = \log_2(r+1)\)

These formulas are not generally equal (e.g., for \(r = 3\), they give 3 vs. 2). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the limit in different notations but they agree.

Take γ = k ∈ ℕ.  
For the q-(or “m-”) Gamma function one has
 Γ_m(k+1) = (1–m)^{1–(k+1)} (m; m)_k = (1–m)^{-k}(m; m)_k,  
so (m; m)_k = (1–m)^k Γ_m(k+1).

Candidate 1:
 Γ(k+1)/Γ_m(k+1) · (1–m)^{-k}
  = k! / [(1–m)^k Γ_m(k+1)] · (1–m)^{-k}
  = k! /(m; m)_k.

This is exactly Candidate 2 for integer γ. Candidate 1 merely rewrites the same value using the q-Gamma function and is valid for real γ as well. Hence the two expressions represent the same quantity.

The two candidates give completely different expressions for \(C_\mathcal{H}(P_2 \times P_m)\).

• Candidate 1: a piece-wise formula involving harmonic numbers \(H_k\) and interior harmonic-sum terms, clearly dependent on the non-polynomial harmonic numbers.

• Candidate 2: a single polynomial \(\frac{3m^{2}-2m}{2}\) (the same for odd or even \(m\)), containing no harmonic numbers.

Because a polynomial in \(m\) cannot equal an expression that contains harmonic numbers \(H_k\) for all \(m\), the two answers are not algebraically identical. Therefore, according to the rules, the candidates are inequivalent.

Because these expressions cannot be algebraically the same (different overall scale and structure), the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give explicit numerical formulas for the single quantity requested:

These are two different integer-valued functions of n.  
For n = 1, Candidate 1 gives 2 while Candidate 2 gives 3, so the expressions are not equal (Rule 4 for numerical comparison; one counterexample suffices to show inequivalence for all n).

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

n = 1 → 2 vs 2  (equal)

n = 3 → 7 vs 6  (not equal)

Since the formulas yield different values (beginning already at n = 3), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two proposed expressions are clearly different.

• Candidate 1:  
 P₍₂₃₁₎(x)= (x¹⁰+2x⁸+x⁷+x⁶−x⁵−2x⁴+x³+2x²−x−1)/(x¹⁰+x⁸+2x⁶−4x⁴+4x²−1)

 Evaluated at x=0, this gives P₍₂₃₁₎(0)=1 (the constant term is 1).

• Candidate 2:  
 P₍₂₃₁₎(x)= x/(1−x−x²)

 Here P₍₂₃₁₎(0)=0 (the constant term is 0).

Since the constant terms already disagree, the two generating functions cannot be the same rational function. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question requires a piece-wise expression that depends on (1) whether m is odd or even and (2) the value/parity of ν.

• Candidate 2 merely lists five simple fractions such as “n/m”, “(n-ν)/m”, etc., with no mention of m’s parity and no match to Candidate 1’s formulas.

The two answers clearly give different mathematical expressions and different case structures, so they cannot be equivalent (Rules 2, 6, 8).

Case 2:  
• Candidate 1: \(M(\mathbf{G},S)\) is trivial (\(\{1\}\))  
• Candidate 2: “answer 2: \(\{1\}\)”  

The group \(\{1\}\) is the trivial group, so the second answers coincide. Thus every sub-answer matches exactly, and the two candidates are equivalent.

Candidate 1 says

• PX is Gaussian with covariance (P / n) I  
• PZ is Gaussian with covariance (N / n) I.

Candidate 2 says

• PX is Gaussian with variance P  
• PZ is Gaussian with variance N.

Unless one assumes the dimension n = 1, these covariances differ by a factor n: in n-dimensions candidate 2 would allocate power n P, not P, to X (and similarly for Z). Because the problem statement does not restrict n to be 1, the two answers are not the same saddle-point distributions.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates say that the saddle point is obtained when  

• the input distribution P_X is zero-mean Gaussian that uses all the available power P, and  
• the noise distribution P_Z is zero-mean Gaussian that uses all the available noise power N.

Candidate 1 writes this in an n-dimensional form with covariance (P/n) I and (N/n) I, while Candidate 2 writes it for the 1-dimensional case with variances P and N.  Candidate 1 reduces to Candidate 2 when n = 1, and nothing in Candidate 2 contradicts the isotropic multidimensional version.  Hence they convey the same essential choice of distributions (zero-mean Gaussians with total power P and N).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not clearly giving the same distributions.

• Candidate 1 explicitly chooses an n-dimensional, zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian with covariance (P / n) I and (N / n) I, which guarantees  
 E|X|² = P and E|Z|² = N.

• Candidate 2 only states “Gaussian with variance P” and “Gaussian with variance N” (and does not specify mean or, in the vector case, how the covariance matrix is scaled).  
 If “variance = P” were interpreted coordinate-wise, the total power would be nP, not P; if interpreted as total power, the covariance should be (P / n) I, which is not stated.  
 Thus Candidate 2 leaves an ambiguity and does not necessarily match the specific isotropic covariance of Candidate 1.

Because Candidate 1 supplies details (mean zero and isotropic covariance) that Candidate 2 either omits or might contradict, the two answers cannot be taken as equivalent under the comparison rules.

Candidate 1 states the answer is the Narayana number

Candidate 2 gives the Narayana number  
N(m, 2).

Because N(k,r) depends on both parameters, these two Narayana numbers are the same only if (m + n, n) = (m, 2), which is not true for general m and n. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two algebraic expressions are different.  
Candidate 1’s numerator is  
 n^{1.5 n} · (n+1)^{0.5 n + 0.5},  
whereas Candidate 2’s numerator is  
 n^{1 n} · (n+1)^{1 n}.  

Because the exponents of n and of (n+1) are not the same (except in pathological cases outside the intended domain), the two constants are not equal. The common denominator n! does not change this discrepancy.

The two candidates give different functional expressions for the same quantity.  
Example: for \(m=2,\;n=2\) (which satisfies \(m=2\) and \(n\) even),  

• Candidate 1 gives \(3\).  
• Candidate 2 gives \(2mn-m-n = 2\cdot2\cdot2-2-2 = 4\).

Since the values disagree, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different closed-form formulas.

Checking a few values:

m = 1  
• Candidate 1 (n = 1): 2¹ – 1 = 1  
• Candidate 2 (n = 1): F₂ = 1  → agree

m = 2  
• Candidate 1 (n = 3): 2² – 1 = 3  
• Candidate 2 (n = 3): F₄ = 3  → agree

m = 3  
• Candidate 1 (n = 5): 2³ – 1 = 7  
• Candidate 2 (n = 5): F₆ = 8  → disagree

Since the formulas do not coincide for all m (they already differ at m = 3), the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for the values of three separate limits, so three answers are required.

• Candidate 1 explicitly states that “each of the above limits is equal to 0,” thereby supplying values for all three limits.

• Candidate 2 gives only a single “0” without specifying that it applies to all three limits; according to Rule 2, this counts as providing fewer answers than required when multiple distinct answers are requested.

Hence, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two explicit limits (one for the unramified case and one for the ramified case).

• Candidate 1 gives:
  – Unramified: \(p^{\sum_{i=1}^{r} (2i-1)\lambda_i}\).
  – Ramified: \(p^{\sum_{i=1}^{r} \bigl((i-1)\lambda_i + \lfloor\lambda_i/2\rfloor\bigr)}\).

• Candidate 2 gives:
  – Unramified: \(1\).
  – Ramified: \(0\).

These answers are not the same (except in trivial special cases where all \(\lambda_i=0\), which the problem does not allow). Therefore the two candidates are inequivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical/algebraic value (the Conley–Zehnder index) expressed in terms of signature(S).

• Candidate 1: μ_CZ(A) = ½ · signature(S)  
• Candidate 2: μ_CZ(A) = signature(S)

They differ by a factor of 2. There is no unit conversion or contextual justification that would make these two expressions equal. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 4 on comparing numerical expressions; they clearly give different values).

The two expressions give different values for almost any \(n\).

Example check:
• For \(n = 1\):  
  – Candidate 1: \(32(1)^3 + 16(1)^2 + 4(1) = 52\).  
  – Candidate 2: \(1 \times 2^{2(1)-2} = 1 \times 2^{0} = 1\).

Since \(52 \neq 1\), the expressions are not equal as functions of \(n\). Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1  
 \(\displaystyle \frac{p^{k}}{|\operatorname{Aut}(G)|}\;
        \prod_{t=1}^{r}\,
        \prod_{j=1}^{\ell(t)}\,
        \prod_{i=1}^{|L^{t}_{j}|}\!
        \phi_{i}\!\bigl(p^{\,k-a_{t}}\bigr)\)

Candidate 2  
 \(\displaystyle \frac{\displaystyle\prod_{i=1}^{r}\phi_{i}(p^{j})}{|\operatorname{Aut}(G)|}\)

Comparison:

1. Overall structure: Candidate 1 contains an extra factor \(p^{k}\) in the numerator; Candidate 2 does not.

2. Product indices:
   • Candidate 1 has three nested products over \(t,\;j,\;i\) that depend on the graph data \(\ell(t)\) and \(|L^{t}_{j}|\).  
   • Candidate 2 has only a single product over \(i=1,\dots ,r\) and even leaves \(j\) inside \(\phi_{i}(p^{j})\) undefined.

3. Arguments of \(\phi_{i}\): Candidate 1 uses \(p^{k-a_{t}}\); Candidate 2 uses \(p^{j}\).

Because the two formulas differ in multiple explicit factors and in their index/argument definitions, they are not mathematically identical.

We compare  

Candidate 1: C(n − 1, k − 1) − C(n − k − 1, k − 1) + 1  

Candidate 2: C(n − 1, k − 1) − C(n − k, k − 1).

Subtracting the second from the first gives  
[C(n − k, k − 1) − C(n − k − 1, k − 1)] + 1.  
Using the Pascal identity, C(n − k, k − 1) − C(n − k − 1, k − 1) = C(n − k − 1, k − 2) > 0 for k ≥ 2. Hence the difference is C(n − k − 1, k − 2)+1 ≠ 0.

Therefore the two expressions are not equal in general.

Expanding each to first order in q:

• Candidate 1  
 (−√2;q)₍∞₎ = (1+√2)(1+√2 q+O(q²)) = (1+√2) + (2+√2) q + O(q²).

• Candidate 2

 (q²;q²)₍∞₎ = 1 + O(q²),  
 so (q;q²)₍∞₎ + √2 (q²;q²)₍∞₎ = (1+√2) − q + O(q²).

The coefficients of q differ (2+√2 versus −1), hence the two expressions cannot be the same function. Therefore the candidates are inequivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different conditions for when the spanning set is non-empty and, in general, different sizes.

• Candidate 1:  
  – Size = 0 if k + l is odd.  
  – Size = (k + l − 1)!! if k + l is even.

• Candidate 2:  
  – Size = 0 if k ≠ l.  
  – Size = (2k − 1)!! if k = l.

Take, for instance, k = 2, l = 4 (so k + l = 6 is even but k ≠ l):  
– Candidate 1 predicts size = (5)!! = 15.  
– Candidate 2 predicts size = 0.

Since they can give different numerical results for the same (k,l), the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 2.24 × 10⁷ s  
→ in days = 22 400 000 s ÷ 86 400 s /day ≈ 259.259 days

Candidate 2: 259 days  
→ in seconds = 259 × 86 400 s ≈ 22 377 600 s

Express both in seconds with 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 2.24000 × 10⁷ s  
• Candidate 2: 2.23776 × 10⁷ s

The values differ already at the third significant digit (2.24000 vs 2.23776); they do not match to six significant digits. Hence, per Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers give times in minutes, so the units match.  
Numerically,

• Candidate 1: 460.5 min → 460.500 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 100 ln 100 ≈ 460.517 min → 460.517 (to six significant digits)

Comparing 460.500 and 460.517, the values differ at the 5th–6th significant digits, so they are not identical to six-digit precision as required by Rule 4. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 100 ln 100 min ≈ 460.517 min (to 6 significant digits)

Comparing the six significant digits, 460.500 ≠ 460.517 (they differ at the 5th significant digit), so the values are not identical to the required precision.

Expressed to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 2.8108 → 2.81080  
• Candidate 2: 2.812 → 2.81200  

Comparing the six significant digits: 2.81080 ≠ 2.81200 (they differ at the 4th digit).

The two candidates give numerical values for \(t\).

Express each to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 10.065778  → 10.0658 (rounded to 6 sig. figs.)  
• Candidate 2: 10.07       → 10.0700 (pad zeros to 6 sig. figs.)

10.0658 and 10.0700 differ at the fourth decimal place, so they do NOT match to 6 significant digits.

According to Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.
The answers are numerical values for the same quantity (“t”) and should be compared to six significant digits (Rule 4).

• Candidate 1: 10.065778 → 10.0658 (to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 10.07 → 10.0700 0 (to 6 significant digits)

Since 10.0658 ≠ 10.0700, the two predictions do not match at six significant digits.

The two candidates provide numerical answers in the same unit (years), but the values differ:

• Candidate 1: 672.4 years  
• Candidate 2: 3240 years  

Since 672.4 ≠ 3240 (they do not match to six significant digits), the answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1:  –1.642876  
  → six significant-digit form: –1.64288

• Candidate 2:  (21 – 9 e^{4/3}) ⁄ 8  
  e^{4/3} ≈ 3.793667894 ⇒ value ≈ –1.642876381  
  → six significant-digit form: –1.64288

Since the two results coincide to six significant digits, the candidates are equivalent according to Rule 4.

Both answers give the decay-rate value but with different time units.

• Convert Candidate 1 to “per week”:
 0.02828 day⁻¹ × 7 day week⁻¹ = 0.19796 week⁻¹ → 0.197960 to six significant digits.

• Candidate 2 already states 0.198 week⁻¹ → 0.198000 to six significant digits.

Comparing 0.197960 and 0.198000, they differ at the 5th significant digit.  
Rule 4 requires the two numbers to match exactly to six significant digits; therefore they are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: 9.73 % → 0.097300 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 9.72 % → 0.097200 (to six significant digits)

These differ at the 4th significant digit (…7300 vs …7200). Therefore they are not the same value to six significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 0.24995  (implicitly in ounces)  
• Candidate 2: 25 / (2 √2501) oz ≈ 0.249950 oz

Expressing both to six significant digits gives 0.249950 in each case. The slight formatting/unit difference does not change the value, so the predictions are equivalent.

Both answers represent a single time value but use different units.  
• Convert Candidate 1 to minutes:  
 7.136 h × 60 min/h = 428.16 min.  

Now compare the two minute values:

Candidate 1: 428.160 (expressed to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 428.140 (expressed to 6 significant digits)

They differ at the 5th significant digit (…160 vs …140).  
Since Rule 4 requires agreement to 6 significant digits, the two numbers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: 0.040800 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 0.040900 (to six significant digits)

They differ in the fourth significant digit, so the results are not identical.  
Additionally, Candidate 1 omits the unit while Candidate 2 specifies kg /m, but even disregarding this, the numeric discrepancy means the answers are not equivalent.

To compare, convert both to numerical values with six significant digits:

Candidate 1: 0.18162 ft → 0.181620 (assume trailing zero for the 6th digit)  
Candidate 2: √19 / 24 ft ≈ 0.181620789 ft → 0.181621 (rounded to six significant digits)

The six-digit values are 0.181620 and 0.181621, which differ at the sixth significant digit.  
Therefore, the two answers are not exactly the same to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 0.18162 ft  
→ written with 6 significant digits: 0.181620

Candidate 2: √19 / 24 ft  
√19 ≈ 4.35889894  
4.35889894 / 24 ≈ 0.181620789  
→ rounded to 6 significant digits: 0.181621

The two numbers differ in the 6th significant digit (0.181620 vs 0.181621), so by Rule 4 they are not considered the same.

Expressed with six significant digits:  
83.8100 m/s² vs. 83.8469 m/s² (or 83.7900 m/s²).

The values do not match to six significant digits, so the predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: “2.50 × 10⁴ N/C” explicitly states the same number.  

Expressed numerically, both correspond to 2.50000 × 10⁴ N/C, matching to at least six significant digits, and the units coincide. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

In Candidate 1, the multiplication sign (×) is omitted, but the standard way of writing a number in scientific notation is “(number) 10^exponent,” and the space between “8.99” and “10^9” clearly indicates the missing “×”. Thus “8.99  10^9 N” is understood as “8.99 × 10^9 N.”

Numerically, both represent 8.99 × 10^9 N = 8.99000 × 10^9 N (same to 6 significant digits). Units are identical.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits (Rule 4):  
5.70000 ≠ 5.71000, so the values are different.  
Units are the same (coulombs), so the discrepancy is purely numerical.

Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

  (3.80000 × 10⁻⁸ C m⁻² when written with six significant digits)

• Candidate 2: 38.2 nC m⁻² = 38.2 × 10⁻⁹ C m⁻² = 3.82 × 10⁻⁸ C m⁻²  
  (3.82000 × 10⁻⁸ C m⁻² with six significant digits)

Comparing to six significant digits: 3.80000 × 10⁻⁸ ≠ 3.82000 × 10⁻⁸.  
Because the values differ (they are different at the third significant digit), the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers give the same physical quantity (angle difference) but in different units.

• Candidate 1: 2.14 °  
  → in radians: 2.14 ° × (π/180) ≈ 0.03736 rad

• Candidate 2: 0.037 rad

Compare in radians to 6 significant digits:
  0.037360 rad vs 0.037000 rad

They differ starting at the third significant digit (and by ≈ 0.00036 rad ≈ 1 %).  
According to Rule 4, they are not considered the same to 6 significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a single numerical result: the difference in glancing angles ( 2θ ), expressed in degrees.

• Candidate 1 gives 2.14 ° (explicitly in degrees).  
• Candidate 2 gives 0.037 (no unit stated, but the expected unit is degrees).

Even if we interpret Candidate 2’s number as degrees, 0.037 ° is not equal to 2.14 °; the two numbers differ by more than six significant digits. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The question requires a single numerical answer for the work, in joules.  
Both candidates supply a numerical value with the same unit (J), so we compare them directly (Rule 4).

Candidate 1: –75 J  
Candidate 2: 76 J  

The magnitudes differ (75 vs 76) and the signs are opposite. They clearly do not match to six significant digits (or even one), so the answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: –0.38  → –0.380000 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: –0.375 → –0.375000 (to six significant digits)

Since –0.380000 ≠ –0.375000, the predictions are not identical.

• Candidate 2: –0.375 J mol⁻¹ →  –0.375000 (to six significant digits)

–0.380000 and –0.375000 differ at the third decimal place, so they do not match to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

  = 1.07 × 10⁶ J mol⁻¹

• Candidate 1: 0.42 pm  
  1 pm = 10⁻¹² m, so 0.42 pm = 0.42 × 10⁻¹² m = 4.2 × 10⁻¹³ m.

• Candidate 2: 4.2 × 10⁻¹³ m.

Hence both answers represent 4.2 × 10⁻¹³ m (identical to at least six significant digits once optional trailing zeros are added). Therefore, the predictions are equivalent.

Both answers give a numerical value in joule-seconds (J·s).

Convert Candidate 2 to the same exponent as Candidate 1:
0.913 × 10⁻³⁴ J·s  =  9.13 × 10⁻³⁵ J·s.

Candidate 1 already states 9.13 × 10⁻³⁵ J·s.

Thus, to six significant digits the two numbers are identical (9.13000 × 10⁻³⁵ J·s), and the units match.

Candidate 1: 27 kcal mol⁻¹  
Candidate 2: 1.87 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  (no “per mol” specified, so energy per entity)

Convert Candidate 1 to joules per molecule:

27 kcal mol⁻¹ × 4184 J kcal⁻¹ = 1.12968 × 10⁵ J mol⁻¹  
Per molecule: 1.12968 × 10⁵ J mol⁻¹ ÷ 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹  
= 1.87583 × 10⁻¹⁹ J (per molecule)

Now compare to Candidate 2 (interpreted as 1.87000 × 10⁻¹⁹ J to six significant digits):

1.87583 × 10⁻¹⁹ J ≠ 1.87000 × 10⁻¹⁹ J (they differ starting at the 4th significant digit).  
Therefore, by Rule 4 they are not identical, and the units (per mol vs per entity) are different without explicit reconciliation.

Candidate 1 gives a numeric value 0.323.  
Candidate 2 gives the expression 1 − 5 e^{−2}.  Numerically,

1 − 5 e^{−2} ≈ 1 − 5 × 0.135335 = 0.323323 … .

Expressed to six significant digits, this is 0.323323 (or 0.323324 if rounded).  
Comparing 0.323000 (Candidate 1, padded with zeros to six significant digits) with 0.323323 (Candidate 2), the values differ at the fourth decimal place, so they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

The question asks for a single numerical value.  
Both candidates give numerical answers with no units, so they are directly comparable.  
Compare to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 14.80 → 14.8000  
• Candidate 2: 16.3  → 16.3000  

14.8000 ≠ 16.3000, so the answers are different.

The question asks for a single percentage.  

Candidate 1: “15.1 %”  
Candidate 2: “15.1%”

• Both give one answer.  
• Both express the same numerical value (15.1) and the same unit (percent).  
• They match exactly to ≥6 significant digits when converted to decimal (0.151000).

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The two answers give numerical values with the same unit (kJ mol⁻¹), so we compare the numbers themselves.

• Candidate 1: −131.1  → −131.100 when written to six significant digits.  
• Candidate 2: −131.13 → −131.130 when written to six significant digits.

Comparing −131.100 and −131.130, they differ in the fifth significant digit (0 vs 3). According to Rule 4, the numbers must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent. They do not.

Candidate 1: 1.95 atm  
1 atm = 101.325 kPa ⇒ 1.95 atm = 1.95 × 101.325 kPa = 197.584 kPa

Candidate 2: 198.5 kPa

Comparing the pressures (expressed in the same unit):
• Candidate 1: 197.584 kPa  
• Candidate 2: 198.500 kPa  

At six significant digits these are 197.584 and 198.500, which differ (already at the third significant digit). Hence the two answers are not exactly the same value.

Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

The two answers use different units, but they can be converted for comparison.

• Candidate 1: 1.51 × 10³ Pa = 1510 Pa.  
  Expressed with six significant digits: 1.51000 × 10³ Pa.

• Candidate 2: 0.015 atm.  
  0.015 atm × 101 325 Pa / atm = 1519.875 Pa.  
  Expressed with six significant digits: 1.51988 × 10³ Pa.

Comparing 1.51000 × 10³ and 1.51988 × 10³ shows a difference at the third significant digit. According to Rule 4, they must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent. They do not.

Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give the vapor pressure in different units.

• Candidate 1: 1.51 × 10³ Pa  
  Converting to atm: 1.51 × 10³ Pa ÷ 1.01325 × 10⁵ Pa atm⁻¹ ≈ 0.0149025 atm (1.49025 × 10⁻² atm).

• Candidate 2: 0.0150 atm (1.50000 × 10⁻² atm).

Expressed with six significant digits:
 Candidate 1 → 1.49025 × 10⁻² atm  
 Candidate 2 → 1.50000 × 10⁻² atm

They differ at the 3rd significant digit, so they do not match to the required six significant digits. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two predictions are:

Candidate 2: 0  (unit not stated)

Even if we assume Candidate 2 intends the same unit (kJ mol⁻¹), the numerical values −57.2 and 0 differ far beyond 6 significant digits. Therefore, by Rule 1 (unit check/ambiguity) and Rule 4 (numeric comparison), the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same numerical value (5.85 × 10⁴), but Candidate 1 omits the unit.  
Because temperature can reasonably be expressed in different units (Kelvin, Celsius, etc.), the absence of a stated unit introduces ambiguity.

The two answers use different units but can be converted:

Candidate 1: 4.86 × 10¹¹ s  
 Years = 4.86 × 10¹¹ s ÷ 3.15576 × 10⁷ s / yr ≈ 1.54004 × 10⁴ yr = 15400.4 yr (to six significant digits).

Candidate 2: 15400 yr = 1.54000 × 10⁴ yr (to six significant digits).

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1: 1.54004 × 10⁴  
• Candidate 2: 1.54000 × 10⁴  

They differ at the fifth significant digit, so they are not equivalent under the strict six-digit criterion.

The two candidates give different numerical predictions:

Candidate 1: 4.49 × 10⁶ s  
Candidate 2: 4.4 × 10⁷ s  

Expressing both with the same exponent (10⁷):

Candidate 1 → 0.449 × 10⁷ s  
Candidate 2 → 4.4 × 10⁷ s  

The significant digits differ (0.449000 vs 4.400000), so the answers are not the same to six significant digits. Therefore the predictions are inequivalent.

Both candidates give four answers, matching the four sub-questions, but for sub-question 2 their units differ:

• Candidate 1: “11.25 feet by 7.5 feet”  
• Candidate 2: “11.25 in by 7.5 in”

Feet and inches are not the same unit (1 ft = 12 in). Since the numerical values are identical but the units are different, the quantities are not equivalent (Rule 1). Therefore the overall answer sets are not identical (Rule 2).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates supply different conditions:

• Candidate 1: “d ≥ 4”  
• Candidate 2: “all degrees 1–9” (i.e., d ≥ 1)

These are not the same set of degrees. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

The first candidate provides a closed-form formula  
  ⌊n²/4⌋ + 1,  

whereas the second candidate lists the first several values of a sequence:  
  1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 21, 39, …  

Evaluating the formula for successive n:

n=1 → 1  
n=2 → 2  
n=3 → 3  
n=4 → 5 (but list gives 6)  
n=5 → 7 (but list gives 11)

Since the formula’s values diverge from the listed sequence starting at n = 4, the two candidates describe different quantities.

Candidate 1 gives  

  ( (n − 1)! )/( d₀! d₁! d₂! ⋯ )   = (1/n) · C(n; d₀,d₁,d₂,…).

Candidate 2 gives  

  ∏_{i ≥ 0}(i!)^{d_i}.

These two formulas are clearly not algebraically the same (e.g. for n = 3 with d₂ = 1, d₀ = 2 they yield 1 vs. 2).  
Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1:  d₍reg₎(Q) = n + ℓₜ ⌈n/2⌉ + 1  
• Candidate 2:  Q = ℓₜ ⌈n/2⌉

Candidate 1 includes the additional terms “+ n + 1,” whereas Candidate 2 does not. The expressions are therefore not the same for general n and ℓₜ.

The two candidates give different formulas for the probability when 1 ≤ s ≤ k (Candidate 1:  (n−s choose k−s)/(n choose k−1);  Candidate 2: 1/k). These expressions are clearly not identical in general (e.g., n=10, k=3, s=1 gives 0.8 vs 1/3). For s outside 1…k both say 0, but since their main probabilities differ, the overall answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for TWO asymptotic quantities:
1. q log τ₀ (in probability)
2. q log E(τ₀)

Hence two answers are required.

Candidate 1 supplies a single expression “d · λ(d,2)” (and does not clearly distinguish the two quantities).  
Candidate 2 supplies two separate answers, both equal to “λ(d,2)”.

Even if Candidate 1 intended its single value to apply to both quantities, it gives “d λ(d,2)” whereas Candidate 2 gives “λ(d,2)”. These are different (for d ≥ 2 the factor d changes the value).

Therefore, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: a product over all faces F in L(M) \ {L₀ ∪ ˆ0} of (–τ_b_F)^{β(F) w_Σ(M_F)} (or equivalently (1–b_F²)^{…}).

Candidate 2: a single product τ_b_F · β(F) · w_Σ(M_F) · det(L(M)) · det(L₀) · det(ˆ0) with no such indexed product and extra determinant factors.

These expressions are not algebraically or structurally the same, hence not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 states: “f(x,y) = 0”.  
• Candidate 2 states: “0”.

Both clearly assert that the value of \(f(x,y)\) is the zero element of \(\mathcal G\). There are no unit issues or multiple sub-answers involved, and the statements are mathematically identical.

The problem asks for one numerical/formula value (the optimal ω as a function of ν).  
Candidate 1 gives ω = 1.  
Candidate 2 gives ω = 1 / (1 + √ν).

For a generic ν ∈ (0, 1), 1 ≠ 1 / (1 + √ν). The two expressions coincide only if √ν = 0, which is impossible in the stated interval. Hence the two answers are different.

The two candidates give different algebraic coefficients for each term in the expansion.

• Candidate 1 attaches the factor (–1)^{l-1} 2^{l-1} to each subset S′ of size l.

• Candidate 2 (aside from the ambiguity of not explicitly summing over S′) effectively uses the factor (–1)^l (with a separate binomial coefficient outside), giving a completely different numerical weight; in particular the power of 2 present in Candidate 1 is absent from Candidate 2.

Therefore the two formulas are not the same.

Example check with q = 3:

  – S = 3^u – 3·2^u  
  – P = 1 – S/3^u = 1 – (3^u – 3·2^u)/3^u = 3·(2/3)^u.

• Candidate 2  
  – P = ((q–2)/q)^u = (1/3)^u.

For u = 1: Candidate 1 gives 2 , Candidate 2 gives 1/3. They clearly differ (and even fall in different numeric ranges).

Therefore the two candidates are inequivalent.

The two candidates propose different explicit formulas for the covering radius:

• Candidate 1: ρ(C) = n − k − 1  
• Candidate 2: ρ(C) = k ⁄ 2

These quantities are not generally equal unless n − k − 1 = k ⁄ 2, i.e., n = 1.5 k + 1, which is not forced by the problem’s hypotheses (n and k range independently under the stated constraints). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers give a single numerical-expression for the requested “maximum cardinality,” so Rule 2 is satisfied.  
We must check whether the two formulas are the same object.

• Candidate 1:  
 max over a residue class m of the sum of |𝒳_ℓ| for all ℓ in that class (mod t+1) between underline ℓ and overline ℓ.

• Candidate 2:  
 |𝒦_{[underline ℓ, overline ℓ]}| divided by ∏_{i=0}^{t}|𝒳_i|.

In general, |𝒦_{[underline ℓ, overline ℓ]}| = Σ_{ℓ=underline ℓ}^{overline ℓ}|𝒳_ℓ|.  
Thus Candidate 2 equals (Σ_{ℓ=underline ℓ}^{overline ℓ}|𝒳_ℓ|) / (∏_{i=0}^{t}|𝒳_i|).

That is not algebraically equal to Candidate 1’s “max over residue classes of partial sums,” except in very special accidental cases (e.g., all |𝒳_ℓ| equal to 1). Since the problem statement provides no such restriction, the two expressions are different.

Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

          = \frac{n-1}{n}\,\frac1{1-n^{-\Gamma}}\)

• Candidate 2  
\( \displaystyle C_{\text{PPIR}}^{(2)} = \frac{\Gamma-1}{\,n-1\,}\)

Even for simple numeric choices (e.g., \(n=2,\ \Gamma=2\)), they give different values:  
\(C^{(1)} = 2/3\), whereas \(C^{(2)} = 1\).

These claims are plainly inconsistent (7 vs. infinitely many). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

   • numerator is (1 − ρ_i(g))

2. Candidate 2:  ∑_{i=0}^{m-1} ρ_i(g) / (1 − ĥμ(ρ_i))
   • includes i = 0 (which makes the term undefined because 1 − ĥμ(ρ_0) = 0)
   • numerator is ρ_i(g), not (1 − ρ_i(g))

These expressions are not algebraically identical; they differ both in the index range and in the form of the summand, and Candidate 2 contains an ill-defined term. Hence they are not equivalent.

The two expressions are generally different.

Example check with r = 2, K = 10, q = 2  
• Candidate 1 → (1/2)·C(2q, 2) = (1/2)·C(4, 2) = 3  
• Candidate 2 → C(10, 2) – C(8, 2) = 45 – 28 = 17  

Since they give different numerical results for permissible parameter values, the formulas cannot be equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different expressions for the “maximum cardinality”:

• Candidate 1:  ∑_{ℓ ≡ ⌊n/2⌋ (mod t+1)}^{n}  {n \choose ℓ}_q  
  (a sum of many q-binomial terms, depending on n and the congruence class modulo t+1)

• Candidate 2:  {n \choose t}_q  
  (a single q-binomial term)

These expressions are clearly not the same for generic n and t; there is no algebraic identity equating such a restricted sum to a single q-binomial coefficient. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

For n = 1, Candidate 1 gives 2, while Candidate 2 gives about 3.236… .

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different closed-form expressions:

• Candidate 2:  a^n / [ Σ_{k=0}^{t} C(n,k)(a−1)^k ].

The functional forms, dependence on the parameters, and even the combinatorial quantities they sum over are unrelated. There is no algebraic manipulation that makes one expression transform into the other for general n,a,t, so the two answers are not equivalent.

Based on the comparison, the two answers differ in the second (δ-) parameter of the claimed differential-privacy guarantee:
• Candidate 1:  (g ε, g e^{ε g} δ)
• Candidate 2:  (g ε, g δ)

Since g e^{ε g} δ ≠ g δ in general, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give very different formulas:

•  Candidate 2:   C = (N² T²)/(2 ε²) ln(2 NK/δ)

•  Candidate 1:   C = T ⌈ max( k NK/ε , (k NK – ln δ)/(2 ε²) ) ⌉ with  
   k = ⌈ (N² T²)/(2 ε²) ln(2 NK/δ) ⌉.

After substituting k into Candidate 1, the leading factors in C become of order  
T·(N K/ε)·k ≈ (N³ K T³)/(2 ε³) ln(2 NK/δ), or even larger from the second term.  
This is orders of magnitude larger than Candidate 2’s (N² T²)/(2 ε²) ln(2 NK/δ) and contains extra factors of N, K, T, and 1/ε.

Therefore the two expressions are not algebraically the same and are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single quantity (“the ATN of the complete \(k\)-partite graph \(K_{n,n,\ldots,n}\)” for even \(n\)).  
Both candidates supply exactly one formula, so Rule 2 (multiple-answer matching) is satisfied.

Compare the two formulas:

• Candidate 1: \(\displaystyle \frac{(k-1)n}{2}\)

• Candidate 2: \(k!\,(n!)^{\,k}\)

These expressions are plainly different functions of \(k\) and \(n\). They cannot be algebraically equal except possibly for some isolated, coincidental values (e.g., very small \(k,n\)), but the problem requires a general formula. Hence, the two answers are not equivalent.

Therefore, according to the rules, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas on the domain  n < m < 2^n.

• Candidate 1: g = 2m − n  
• Candidate 2: g = n

For any m strictly greater than n, 2m − n ≠ n (indeed 2m − n > n).  
Hence the two piecewise definitions disagree on that interval.

The two equations differ only in the form of the trigonometric term:

Candidate 1: … + sin(arccos(1 − c))
Candidate 2: … + √(2 c − c²)

Since for any u in [−1, 1] we have sin(arccos u) = √(1 − u²), take u = 1 − c:

sin(arccos(1 − c)) = √(1 − (1 − c)²)  
          = √(1 − (1 − 2c + c²))  
          = √(2c − c²).

Thus the extra terms in both candidates are identical. All other parts of the equations match exactly, so the two implicit equations are algebraically the same.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidate equations are not algebraically equivalent.

Candidate 1:
(1 − c)(π − arccos(1 − c)) + sin(arccos(1 − c)) = π/2

Candidate 2:
2 ( arccos(1 − c) − √(2c − c²) ) = π
 ⇔ arccos(1 − c) − √(2c − c²) = π/2

Using sin(arccos(1 − c)) = √(2c − c²), Candidate 1 becomes
(1 − c)(π − arccos(1 − c)) + √(2c − c²) = π/2,
which cannot be rearranged to arccos(1 − c) − √(2c − c²) = π/2 except in the impossible case √(2c − c²)=π/2 (independent of c). Therefore the two equations describe different conditions for c.

Hence, the predictions are inequivalent.
Both candidates state the same implicit equation once the trigonometric term in Candidate 1 is simplified:

sin(arccos(1 – c))  
 = √(1 – (1 – c)²)  
 = √(1 – (1 – 2c + c²))  
 = √(2c – c²) (for 0 < c < 1).

Replacing sin(arccos(1 – c)) with √(2c – c²) in Candidate 1 gives

(1 – c)(π – arccos(1 – c)) + √(2c – c²) = π/2,

which is exactly Candidate 2.

Hence the two candidates are algebraically identical and therefore equivalent.

2) the value of the double sum.

Candidate 1 outputs only a single value \(5\pi^{2}/12\), implicitly using it for both parts.  
Candidate 2 gives two distinct values: “Divergent” (for the integral) and \(5\pi^{2}/12\) (for the sum).

• Candidate 2: (π / 8)·[ln(1 + √2)]² ≈ 0.305063  

Since the values differ already in the first few significant digits (0.322982 vs. 0.305063), they are not equal to six significant digits.

Both candidates give the single numerical answer “0.”  
• The problem requires only one value.  
• Both answers are the same real number, matching to at least six significant digits (0.000000…).  
• No unit discrepancies or additional sub-answers are involved.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions:

Candidate 1: e^{-az}\,H_0^{(1)}(z)  (where H_0^{(1)} = J_0 + iY_0)

Candidate 2: π\,e^{az}\,J_0(z)

Because H_0^{(1)}(z) contains an imaginary part iY_0(z) while Candidate 2 involves only the real Bessel function J_0(z), and the exponential factors are opposite (e^{-az} vs. e^{az}), the two results cannot be identical for general positive a and z. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give completely different functional forms for I(z):

• Candidate 1: I(z) = e^{−az} H₀^{(1)}(z) (an oscillatory Hankel-function behavior)

• Candidate 2: I(z) = π e^{z(a−1)} (a simple exponential)

These expressions are not the same for general positive a and z; the Hankel function cannot in general reduce to a single exponential factor. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give algebraic expressions for the same quantity.

Check algebraically:
sin(π/5)=√(10−2√5)/4.

Candidate 2: 5π/sin(π/5)=5π /(√(10−2√5)/4)=(20π)/√(10−2√5).

Candidate 1: π√(10(√5+5))=π√(10√5+50).

Square and compare (ignoring the common factor π²):

(20/√(10−2√5))² = 400/(10−2√5)
(√(10√5+50))² = 10√5+50.

Compute (10√5+50)(10−2√5)=400, so the two squared quantities are equal, hence the original expressions are identical.

Thus the two predictions are equivalent.

The only difference between the two candidates is the placement of the index on the component of \(u\):  
• Candidate 1 writes \(u^{i}\).  
• Candidate 2 writes \(u_{i}\).

In ordinary Euclidean \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) (with the standard metric implicitly understood), these notations both denote the \(i\)-th coordinate of the vector \(u\); no additional factors (such as a metric tensor) are required to convert between them. Because multiplication of real scalars is commutative, the order \(g_i(u)\,u^{i}\) versus \(u_i\,g_i(u)\) is immaterial.

Hence the two expressions represent the same formula for \(g(u)\).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same formula up to a notational difference:

• Candidate 1: g(u) = g(0) + ∑_{i=1}^n g_i(u)\,u^i  
• Candidate 2: g(u) = g(0) + ∑_{i=1}^n u_i\,g_i(u)

Multiplication is commutative, and in ℝⁿ with the standard (Kronecker‐delta) metric the component written with a superscript (u^i) is numerically the same as that written with a subscript (u_i). Hence the two expressions are the same.

The two expressions are not the same.

• For 0 ≤ r ≤ 1  
  – Candidate 1 gives I(r)= (2 − (2/3) r²).  
  – Candidate 2 gives I(r)= (r³/3 − r).  
  These are different functions (e.g., at r = 0, Candidate 1 → 2, Candidate 2 → 0).

• For r ≥ 1  
  – Candidate 1 gives I(r)= 4/(3r).  
  – Candidate 2 gives I(r)= −2/3.  
  These are also clearly different.

Hence the two candidates are inequivalent.

The question requests the value of the right–hand semiderivative \(f'_+(a)\).  
Because \(f'\) is assumed to extend continuously to \(a\), we have  

\(f'_+(a)=\displaystyle\lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
           =\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^+}f'(x)=f'(a).\)

• Candidate 1 gives \(\displaystyle\lim_{x\to a^+} f'(x)\).  
• Candidate 2 gives \(\displaystyle\lim_{h\to0^+}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\).

Under the given continuity assumption these two limits coincide, so both candidates produce the same value for \(f'_+(a)\).

The question asks for two specific limits.  

Candidate 1 gives:
1. 1/2  
2. +∞  

Candidate 2 gives:  
1/2, +∞  

Both candidates supply exactly two values, and the numerical values (1/2 and +∞) match perfectly in the same order. Hence, the answers are identical.

The two candidates give completely different formulas for N.

• Candidate 1 supplies an explicit analytic expression involving arctangent and an integral of \(f, f', f''\).

• Candidate 2 simply states that \(N\) equals “the number of sign changes of \(f\)” on the interval.

These are not the same description, nor are they obviously equivalent by any of the provided rules.
