Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different elements of the Grothendieck–Witt ring.

• Candidate 1: ½ · (2j choose j) · (⟨1⟩ + ⟨u⟩)  
  = ( (2j choose j)/2 ) copies of ⟨1⟩ plus the same number of copies of ⟨u⟩.

• Candidate 2: (2j choose j) · ⟨1⟩  
  = (2j choose j) copies of ⟨1⟩ only.

Even though ½·(2j choose j) is an integer (since (2j choose j) is always even for j > 0), the two expressions differ in their anisotropic part (Candidate 1 includes ⟨u⟩’s, Candidate 2 does not). Hence they are not equivalent in GW(𝔽_q).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different elements of the Grothendieck–Witt group.

• Candidate 1:  (½) · (2j choose j) · (1 + u)  
 This is ( (2j choose j)/2 ) copies of the hyperbolic plane, whose rank equals (2j choose j).

• Candidate 2:  ⟨1⟩ + ⟨−1⟩  
 This is exactly one hyperbolic plane (rank 2).

These two coincide only in the special case j = 1 (when (2j choose j)/2 = 1), but the question asks for general non-negative j. Hence, in general, the answers are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the answer

  ½ · C(2j, j) · (⟨1⟩ + ⟨−1⟩),

just written with different notation for the same hyperbolic form (candidate 1 uses “1 + u”, where u denotes ⟨−1⟩). Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give different closed-form product expressions for both \(S_1\) and \(S_2\); the formulas are not algebraically identical. Hence the answers are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates provide a single numerical formula for every positive integer n, so we compare the two sequences they define.

Test small values:

n = 1:  
 Candidate 1 → ⌊1²/4⌋ + 1 = 1  
 Candidate 2 → Fib(2) = 1  (match)

n = 2:  
 Candidate 1 → ⌊4/4⌋ + 1 = 2  
 Candidate 2 → Fib(3) = 2  (match)

n = 3:  
 Candidate 1 → ⌊9/4⌋ + 1 = 3  
 Candidate 2 → Fib(4) = 3  (match)

n = 4:  
 Candidate 1 → ⌊16/4⌋ + 1 = 5  
 Candidate 2 → Fib(5) = 5  (match)

n = 5:  
 Candidate 1 → ⌊25/4⌋ + 1 = 7  
 Candidate 2 → Fib(6) = 8  (do not match)

Since the sequences diverge (already at n=5), the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different explicit formulas for the requested count:

• Candidate 1: ⌊n²/4⌋ + 1 (quadratic growth in n)  
• Candidate 2: F_{n+1} (Fibonacci numbers—exponential growth in n)

Since a quadratic function and the Fibonacci sequence are not equal for all positive integers n (indeed they differ already for small n such as n = 3, where ⌊9/4⌋+1=3 while F₄=3, but for n = 4 we get ⌊16/4⌋+1=5 versus F₅=5 coincidentally, and they soon diverge: n = 5 gives 7 versus 8, etc.), the two answers are clearly not the same. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different formulas:

• Candidate 2: dreg Q = ⌈ n / (2 ℓₜ) ⌉

These are not algebraically identical and will not, in general, evaluate to the same number for arbitrary integers n and parameter ℓₜ. Hence they are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are clearly different:

• Candidate 1: n + ℓₜ ⌈n / 2⌉ + 1  
• Candidate 2: ℓₜ ⌈n / 2⌉

Candidate 1 contains the extra terms n and +1 that are absent from Candidate 2. Since no general identity makes n + 1 vanish for all integers n, the two formulas cannot be the same for arbitrary n and ℓₜ.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas.

• Candidate 2: 
 N_neg = S / n

(where S = ∑_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d})

Candidate 1 includes an extra floor term and a factor 1/2 in front of the sum that are absent in Candidate 2. These expressions cannot coincide for all n, so the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates supply explicit formulas for the same quantity.  
Candidate 1’s formula has

• a factor 1/(2n) (instead of 1/n),  
• an additional term involving a floor, powers of 2 and n,  

whereas Candidate 2’s formula is only the cyclotomic‐type sum (1/n) ∑_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d}.  
These two expressions are clearly not algebraically identical; evaluating, for instance, at n = 1 already gives different numerical results (1 vs. 2). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions being compared are

Candidate 1: ∫   \overline{sgn(f(x))}\,|f(x)|^{p-1}\,g(x) dλ(x)=0

Candidate 2: ∫   |f(x)|^{p-2}\,f(x)\,g(x) dμ(x)=0

Observe that
 |f|^{p-2} f = sgn(f) |f|^{p-1} (for real-valued f),
whereas for complex-valued f we have
 \overline{sgn(f)} |f|^{p-1} = \overline{f}\,|f|^{p-2}.

Thus:

• In the real case the integrands in Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 coincide, so the conditions are the same.

• In the complex case they differ by complex conjugation: Candidate 1 uses \overline{f}|f|^{p-2} g, whereas Candidate 2 uses f|f|^{p-2} g. The standard Birkhoff-orthogonality condition in the complex Lᵖ space involves the conjugate (as in Candidate 1), so the two candidates are not equivalent for complex functions.

Because the original question does not restrict to real functions and Candidate 1 explicitly includes the conjugation while Candidate 2 does not, the two candidates cannot be regarded as universally equivalent.

The two candidates give different algebraic expressions.

Candidate 1:

Candidate 2:
 q^{maj(σ)+maj(π)} · [m+n−r−s ╲ k−r−s]_q

Even after accounting for the common prefactor q^{maj(σ)+maj(π)}, the remaining factors are not the same: candidate 1 has a product of two q-binomials and an extra q-power, whereas candidate 2 has only one q-binomial. For typical parameter values (e.g., m = n = 2, r = s = 0, k = 1) the two expressions evaluate to different polynomials, so they cannot be equivalent.

Candidate 1 states the probability (for s = 1,…,k) is  

 P₁(s) = C(n−s, k−s) / C(n, k−1).

Candidate 2 claims the probability is the constant 1/k for every s in that range.

Unless the combinatorial fraction C(n−s, k−s) / C(n, k−1) simplifies to 1/k for all admissible n, k, s, the two answers differ. In general it does not (e.g., take n = 5, k = 3, s = 2: Candidate 1 gives 3/10, Candidate 2 gives 1/3). Therefore the two predictions are not the same.

Candidate 1 lists eight palindromic run-length sequences:
1, 2, 3, 22, 212, 232, 12321, 32123.

Candidate 2 lists four sequences (using bracket notation to show the sequence elements):
[1], [2], [2, 2], [2, 1, 2].

Interpreting “[a, b, c]” as the sequence of numbers a b c, Candidate 2 supplies palindromes corresponding to 1, 2, 22, 212 only.  
It omits 3, 232, 12321, 32123 that appear in Candidate 1.  

Since the two answers provide different sets (and the question asks for the complete list), the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 produces a lengthy quadratic form that contains x², y², z² terms and also mixed terms xy, xz, yz with coefficients that are generally non-zero functions of p_x, p_y, p_z, d.

Candidate 2 gives a much simpler quadratic form
p_x^{d-2} X² + p_y^{d-2} Y² + p_z^{d-2} Z² = 0,
which contains only the pure square terms and no mixed terms at all.

Since for a generic point and generic parameter d the mixed-term coefficients in Candidate 1 are not zero, the two quadratic forms cannot coincide. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas for λ(θₙ,₀(E)):

• Candidate 1:  λ = λ(𝓧) + (p – 1)/12 · ordₚ(Δ_E) · p^{n–1}  
• Candidate 2:  λ = λ(𝓧) – (p – 1) · ordₚ(Δ_E) · p^{n–1}

They differ in both the sign and the factor 1/12 in the term involving ordₚ(Δ_E). Since these expressions are not algebraically the same (and no contextual identity makes them coincide), the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas.

Candidate 1: λ(θₙ,₀(E)) = [(p − 1) · ordₚ(Δ_E)/12] · p^{n-1} + λ(𝒳(E/ℚ_∞))

Candidate 2: λ(θₙ,₀(E)) = λ(𝒳(E/ℚ_∞)) + p^{n-1}(p − 1) − ordₚ(Δ_E)

Comparing the extra terms beyond λ(𝒳):

• Candidate 1 adds ((p − 1)/12) · ordₚ(Δ_E) · p^{n-1}.  
• Candidate 2 adds (p − 1) · p^{n-1} − ordₚ(Δ_E).

These expressions involve different powers of p multiplied by ordₚ(Δ_E) and different coefficients (one has division by 12 and attaches ordₚ(Δ_E) to p^{n-1}; the other subtracts ordₚ(Δ_E) without p^{n-1}). In general they are not algebraically equal.

Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for two explicit cardinalities (one for \(2k+1\) and one for \(2k\)).  
Both candidates supply two formulas, so Rule 2 is satisfied.  

Compare the formulas:

1. Candidate 1 (odd):  
   \(|A_{\mathbb Z[i],2k+1}| = 14\cdot4^{k+1}-34\cdot2^{k+1}+8k+29\).  
   This grows on the order of \(4^{k}\).

   Candidate 2 (odd):  
   \(|A_{\mathbb Z[i],2k+1}| = 4\,\sum_{d\mid(2k+1)}\chi(d)\).  
   The sum over the Dirichlet character \(\chi\) is bounded by the divisor count of \(2k+1\), i.e. \(O(k^\varepsilon)\); it is at most a small integer.

   These two expressions cannot coincide for all \(k\) (the first is exponential, the second is at most polynomially bounded).  

2. Candidate 1 (even):  
   \(|A_{\mathbb Z[i],2k}| = 28\cdot4^{k}-48\cdot2^{k}+8k+25\) (also exponential).

   Candidate 2 (even):  
   \(|A_{\mathbb Z[i],2k}| = 4\,\sum_{d\mid m}\chi(d)\) where \(m\) is the odd part of \(k\).  
   Again this is bounded by a small integer independent of any power \(4^{k}\).

Since the growth behaviours are fundamentally incompatible, the two candidates give different answers for both sub-problems.

• Integrand: 
  – Candidate 1 uses h_L^q · h_K^{1 – q}.  
  – Candidate 2 uses h_L · h_K^{q – p}.  
  The exponents of both h_L and h_K differ.

Since the factors and the integrands are not the same, the expressions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives

• j = 0   H = m / (2m + 1)  
• j = 1 or m H = (m + 2)/(2(2m + 1))  
• 1 < j < m H = (m + 3)/(2(2m + 1))

Candidate 2 gives

• j = 0   H = (9m + 2)/6  
• j = 1 or m H = (5m + 10)/6  
• 1 < j < m H = (5m + 14)/6

Compare the first case (j = 0):  

Candidate 1: m / (2m + 1)  
Candidate 2: (9m + 2)/6

For a general m these two expressions are not algebraically equal (e.g., for m = 1 they are 1/3 vs 11/6). Since they already disagree in one piece of the piece-wise definition, the two overall answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates assert that the value of \(f(x,y)\) is zero for every \(x,y\in\mathcal G\):
• Candidate 1 explicitly states “\(f(x,y)=0\).”

There is only one required answer, no unit ambiguity, and both convey the identical result.

The two expressions are structurally different.

Candidate 1 (q-Pochhammer):
(-q^r; ε q^{r+t+s})_∞ = ∏_{k=0}^{∞} ( 1 − (−q^r)(ε q^{r+t+s})^k )
                    = ∏_{k=0}^{∞} ( 1 + ε^k q^{\,r + (r+t+s)k} ).

Its factors are
1 + ε^k q^{r + (r+t+s)k}         for k = 0,1,2,…

Candidate 2 (separated products):
∏_{m=1}^{∞} (1 + q^{\,r(2m−1)+t}) · ∏_{m=1}^{∞} (1 − ε q^{s m}).

The first group of factors involves exponents r(2m−1)+t (always with a “+” sign), and the second group involves exponents s m with a sign that is independent of k in the first group.

Because

• the exponents in Candidate 1 are r + k(r+t+s) (e.g. r, 2r+t+s, 3r+2t+2s,…), which do not match the two separate arithmetic progressions appearing in Candidate 2, and  
• the signs of the individual factors in Candidate 1 alternate with ε^k, whereas in Candidate 2 the signs are fixed in each of the two products,

the two infinite products cannot, in general, be the same expression. A simple numerical choice (e.g. r = 1, t = 0, s = 1, ε = 1) already shows Candidate 1 reduces to ∏_{k≥0}(1+q^{2k+1}) while Candidate 2 contains an extra factor ∏_{m≥1}(1−q^{m}).

Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers give two different infinite-product (q-Pochhammer) expressions:

Candidate 1: (-q^r ; ε q^{r+t+s})_\infty  
  = ∏_{k=0}^{∞} (1 + ε^{\,k} q^{\,r+k(r+t+s)}).

Candidate 2: (-q^r ; q^{r+t})_\infty · (- ε q^s ; q^s)_\infty  
  = [∏_{k=0}^{∞} (1 + q^{\,r+k(r+t)})] · [∏_{m=0}^{∞} (1 + ε q^{\,s+m s})].

The first product runs over a single index with step (r+t+s); the second is a product of two independent Pochhammer products with steps (r+t) and s.  
Already for, say, r = t = s = 1 and ε = 1,

• Candidate 1 contains the single factor (1+q) once,  
• Candidate 2 contains (1+q) twice (one from each product),

so the two expressions are not the same. No general identity equates these forms for arbitrary non-negative integers r,t,s and ε = ±1.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

= (σ₂² (σ₁² + c²)) / (σ₁² (σ₂² + c²))

Sub-question (b):

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give two answers, matching the two sub-questions.

Sub-answer (a):
• Candidate 1: “$\EXP$-complete”  
• Candidate 2: “EXPTIME”

In standard complexity theory, EXP (or $\EXP$) and EXPTIME denote the same deterministic exponential-time class, so these are equivalent. (The “-complete” suffix in Candidate 1 only states completeness with respect to that class; Candidate 2 simply names the class, but the decision problem’s complexity class is the same. Because both are describing the complexity of the decision problem itself, the presence or absence of the word “complete” does not change the predicted class; both indicate EXPTIME.)

Sub-answer (b):
• Candidate 1: “$\P$”  
• Candidate 2: “P”

These are identical.

Thus every required sub-answer coincides.

The two candidate formulas for σ_sum²(C,C) are structurally different.

• Candidate 1 coefficient of σ_element² is n(n-2)/(2(n-3)); Candidate 2’s coefficient is n.

• Candidate 1 subtracts (1/((n-1)(n-3))) Σ ⟨R_k, ĤC⟩² (sum of squares).  
  Candidate 2 subtracts (1/n)(Σ ⟨R_k, ĤC⟩)² (square of sum).

These are different mathematical expressions for general n and general inner-product values. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different explicit formulas for σ_sum²(C,C):

• Candidate 1:  σ_sum² = [n(n – 2)]/[2(n – 3)] σ_element²  –  1/[(n – 1)(n – 3)] ∑⟨R_k, Ĉ⟩²

• Candidate 2:  σ_sum² = (1/n) ∑⟨R_k, Ĉ⟩² – ( (1/n) ∑⟨R_k, Ĉ⟩ )²

Candidate 1 involves σ_element² with non-trivial coefficients, whereas Candidate 2 contains no σ_element² term and has a different combination of the inner-product sums. The two expressions are therefore not the same (no algebraic manipulation can equate them without introducing additional unstated identities).

Hence the answers are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give completely different algebraic formulas for σ_sum²(C,C).

Although the sign factor (–1)^{l–1} matches, 2^{l–1} is generally not equal to l (only for l = 1,2 do they coincide numerically, and they differ for l ≥ 3). Hence the two expressions are not the same identity for general k and l.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2:  n(q – 1)/2

To see they cannot be identical, plug in simple values, e.g. n = 2, q = 2 (both > 1):

Candidate 1 → 3.75  
Candidate 2 → 1

The two candidates give different formulas:

• Candidate 1:  ATN = mn / (m + n) + 1  
• Candidate 2:  ATN = mn / (m + n)

The second expression lacks the “+ 1” term. Under any values of m and n (including the constraints m < n, n even, (m+n) | mn), these two quantities differ by exactly 1, so they cannot be equal.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions.

• Candidate 1:  maxₘ  ∑_{ℓ = \underline{ℓ}}^{\overline{ℓ}, ℓ≡m (mod t+1)} |𝓧_ℓ|

This sums |𝓧_ℓ| over an entire congruence class modulo (t+1) and then takes the largest such sum.

• Candidate 2:  max_{\underline{ℓ}≤ℓ≤\overline{ℓ}} |𝓧_ℓ|

This takes only the single largest |𝓧_ℓ|.

In general these quantities are not the same (the first can be strictly larger because it may add several |𝓧_ℓ|’s). Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two proposed formulas for V are

Candidate 1: V = (1 − ∏ p_i) / ∑ ((1 − p_i)/p_i)

Candidate 2: V = 1 / ∑ (1/p_i)

To be equivalent we would need

(1 − ∏ p_i) · ∑ (1/p_i) = ∑ ((1 − p_i)/p_i).

But the right-hand side equals ∑ (1/p_i) − n (where n = |S|), whereas the left-hand side equals (1 − ∏ p_i) · ∑ (1/p_i). These two expressions are not generally equal (they coincide only in the trivial case n = 1). Therefore the two candidates give different formulas for V and are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit expressions.

• Candidate 2: gpack = gpack(P_{d₂} ⊠ P_{d₃} ⊠ … ⊠ P_{dᵣ}) (the same graph invariant of the product that omits the first factor, left unevaluated).

Unless the invariant gpack of a product of paths always equals the plain numerical product of the path lengths involved (which is generally false—for example, for a single path Pₙ the invariant is not generally n), the two formulas will differ for many admissible choices of d₂,…,dᵣ (e.g., d₂ = 3).

The question asks for BOTH  
1) the total count of intermediate logics with Craig interpolation, and  
2) the explicit list of those logics.  

• Both candidates state the count is 7.  
• However, their seven-item lists are different:

Candidate 1: {IPC, Sm, GSc, LC, KC, Bd₂, CPC}  
Candidate 2: {IPC, KP, LC, KC, CL, Sc, KCr}

Only four items coincide (IPC, LC, KC, CPC/CL). The remaining three items of each list do not match and are not obviously synonymous.  
Since the required lists are not identical, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 2 & Rule 3).

Candidate 1: {IPC, Sm, GSc, LC, KC, Bd₂, CPC}  
Candidate 2: {IPC, CPC, LC, KC, LC ∨ KC, BD₂, G₃}

• Candidate 1 includes “Sm” and “GSc,” which do not appear in Candidate 2.  
• Candidate 2 includes “LC ∨ KC” and “G₃,” which do not appear in Candidate 1.  
Even allowing for possible notational variants (e.g., “BD₂” vs “Bd₂”), the sets are not the same.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical/count expression (the maximum size of a ball).  
Both candidates supply exactly one algebraic expression in the same variables n and q, so units and number of answers align.

Candidate 1: n²(q − 1) − n + 2  
Candidate 2: n(q − 3) + 1

These two expressions are not algebraically identical (one is quadratic in n, the other linear) and cannot coincide for all admissible n and q. Hence they are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different formulas for dem(C(ℓ,k)) in each range of ℓ:  

• Candidate 1 expresses dem(C(ℓ,k)) with a ceiling-sum (and an extra linear tail when ℓ ≥ a_k+1).  
• Candidate 2 gives the much simpler expressions 2ℓ and k for the same two ranges.

Since these two piecewise formulas cannot be algebraically identical for arbitrary k and ℓ (e.g., when ℓ=2, k=9, Candidate 1’s first case already differs from 2ℓ=4), they are not equivalent.  

Therefore, the answers are not the same.

• Candidate 2: 1 − (d − 1) λ

These expressions are not the same function of λ (and Candidate 2 also depends on d whereas Candidate 1 does not). Except for very special accidental values of d and λ, they are unequal, so the answers are not equivalent.

We compare the two proposed expansion constants:

Candidate 2: (d λ + 1) / (d + 1)

Candidate 1 depends only on λ, whereas Candidate 2 depends on both λ and the dimension d. Since d is a variable parameter of the complex and is not fixed or eliminated, the two formulas cannot coincide for all possible values of d and λ. Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a formula for the size of a largest subset of {0,…,n} whose chosen indices differ by more than t, but the two formulas do not coincide.

Take n = 2 and t = 1.  
• Candidate 1 requires ℓ ≡ ⌊n/2⌋ (mod t+1) = 1 (mod 2); the admissible ℓ are {1}. So its size is 1.  
• Candidate 2 allows any set of indices whose pairwise distance exceeds 1 and then sums over those k. A maximal such set is {0,2}, whose size is 2.

Because the two candidates give different cardinalities in this example, their answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 
C = (1 − 1/N) / [1 − 1 / N^{K/D}]

Candidate 2: 
C = (1 − D/N) / [1 − (D/N)^{K/D}]

With N = D + 1 (as stated in the problem):

• Numerators  
 Candidate 1: 1 − 1/N = (N − 1)/N = D / N  
 Candidate 2: 1 − D/N = (N − D)/N = 1 / N  

 These are equal only when D = 1; for general D they differ.

• Denominators  
 Candidate 1: 1 − 1/N^{K/D}  
 Candidate 2: 1 − (D/N)^{K/D} = 1 − (D/(D+1))^{K/D}  

 Except for D = 1, these are different factors.

Since, for general D (D > 1), both the numerator and the denominator differ, the two expressions are not algebraically identical. Therefore the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

Substituting simple integer values (e.g. k = 1, a = 1, p = 0.5):

 Candidate 1 → 0.375,  
 Candidate 2 → 0.333…

The two candidates give fundamentally different expressions for k.

• Candidate 1 provides a very explicit, enormous formula involving exp (·) and powers of p and ξ.  
• Candidate 2 only states an asymptotic bound “\(k = p^{O(1/\xi^{2})}\),” i.e., that k is at most polynomial in p with exponent proportional to \(1/\xi^{2}\).

These descriptions are not algebraically or numerically identical, nor can one be derived directly from the other without extra unstated assumptions. Therefore, by the rules (notably Rule 6 on type mismatch and completeness), the answers are not equivalent.

These expressions are plainly not the same function of \(n\). For instance, at \(n=2\), Candidate 1 gives \(2\) while Candidate 2 gives \(1\). Hence the answers are inequivalent (Rule 8: different explicit formulas that are not algebraically identical).

Candidate 2: σ_i = ½ · 1/sin θ

where θ = (2i − 1)π/(4ℓ + 2).

For i = 1,…,ℓ, θ lies strictly between 0 and π/2, so sin θ is strictly positive. Therefore |1/sin θ| = 1/sin θ, and the absolute-value bars in Candidate 1 have no effect. Thus the two expressions are identical for all allowed indices.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

• Candidate 2:  C(n,⌊n/2⌋)

The two expressions give different numerical values in general.

Set them equal:
(k − 1)n / 2 = n(k + 1) − 2  
⇒ (k − 1)n = 2n(k + 1) − 4  
⇒ n(k − 1 − 2k − 2) + 4 = 0  
⇒ n(−k − 3) + 4 = 0  
⇒ n(k + 3) = 4.

For positive integers k and even n (with k ≥ 2), this equation cannot be satisfied. Hence the two formulas are not algebraically the same (except in impossible/non-integer cases).

Therefore, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.

• When \(\varphi\) is not satisfiable:

 – Candidate 2 gives \(0\).

Unless \(k\) is restricted to \(0\) or \(1\) (which the problem statement does not say), these expressions are generally not the same (e.g., for \(k=2\): \(\lfloor k/2\rfloor = 1\neq 0\)). Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question requests two pieces of information:  
1. A formula for arbitrary m × n Ferrers diagrams (with m ≥ n ≥ 2).  
2. The specialization to n × n diagrams.

Candidate 1 supplies both:
• General formula: \(\dfrac{m-n+1}{m}\binom{m+n-2}{\,n-1\,}\).  
• n × n case: Catalan number \(C_{n-1}=\dfrac1n\binom{2n-2}{\,n-1\,}\).

Candidate 2 gives only a single expression, \(\binom{2n-4}{\,n-2\,}\), with no general m,n formula.  
Moreover, \(\binom{2n-4}{\,n-2\,}\) is not equal to the Catalan number \(C_{n-1}\) for all n (e.g. at n = 4 it yields 6 while \(C_3=5\)).

Thus the two candidates do not provide the same answers, and Candidate 2 is incomplete relative to the question’s requirements.

The two proposed results are completely different Meijer-G representations.

1. The overall prefactors differ:  
   • Candidate 1 has 1/(4 π^{3/2});  
   • Candidate 2 has a^{-s}.  
   These factors cannot be converted into each other by any simple change of variables or Meijer-G identity.

2. The Meijer-G functions themselves have different parameters:  
   • Candidate 1: G_{3,5}^{5,2}(a^{2}/4 | … ).  
   • Candidate 2: G_{2,3}^{3,1}(a | … ).  
   The orders (p, q, m, n) and the arguments (a^{2}/4 versus a) do not match, nor do the lists of upper and lower parameters.

3. No standard property of Meijer-G functions turns one expression with these parameter sets and argument a^{2}/4 into the other with argument a and a completely different prefactor.

Because the expressions are not the same function (even up to a constant factor or a simple rescaling of the argument) the two answers give inequivalent results for the integral.

The two candidates give the following numerical quantities  

Candidate 1: π  

Candidate 2: π [erf(eᵉ)]²  

For the real number E = eᵉ ≈ 15.15426,  
erf(E) = 1 − O(10⁻¹⁰⁰); hence [erf(E)]² = 1 − O(10⁻¹⁰⁰).  
Therefore  

π [erf(E)]² = π − O(10⁻¹⁰⁰).  

The difference between the two candidates is on the order of 10⁻¹⁰⁰, so the two values agree to far more than the 6 significant digits required by Rule 4. Thus, within the tolerance set by the rules, the two answers are considered the same.

The two candidates both give the result

The two candidates give exactly the same mathematical expression:

Candidate 1:  (1/2) [ ψ((1+b)/2) − ψ(b/2) ]

Candidate 2:  (1/2) [ ψ((b+1)/2) − ψ(b/2) ]

Since (1+b)/2 = (b+1)/2, both answers are identical up to notation. Thus they are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same mathematical expression, since

Candidate 1:  ζ(3)/4 − (π²/4) ln 2  
     = [ζ(3) − π² ln 2]/4

Candidate 2:  [ζ(3) − π² ln 2]/4

Hence the two answers are algebraically identical.

The two expressions represent the same quantity:

Candidate 1: (16 π / 3) (1 − 1/√2)
     = 2 · (8 π / 3) (1 − 1/√2)
     = (8 π / 3) (2 − 2/√2)
     = (8 π / 3) (2 − √2)

Candidate 2: (8 π / 3)(2 − √2)

Thus Candidate 1 simplifies exactly to Candidate 2. They are equivalent.

The two candidates give different coefficients for both ζ(5) and π² ζ(3):

• Candidate 1: 372 ζ(5)  – 28 π² ζ(3)  
• Candidate 2:  64 ζ(5)  – 16 π² ζ(3)

Since 372 ≠ 64 and –28 ≠ –16, the expressions are not the same. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different linear combinations of the (apparently independent) constants ζ(5) and π² ζ(3):

• Candidate 1: 372 ζ(5) − 28 π² ζ(3)  
• Candidate 2:  60 ζ(5) − 16 π² ζ(3)

The coefficients of both ζ(5) and π² ζ(3) differ, and there is no known relation that would make these two distinct combinations equal. A quick numerical check also shows different values. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

These two sets are different: numbers in the interval (0, 2) (for example 1) are included in Candidate 2’s domain but excluded from Candidate 1’s domain, while 0 itself is excluded by both candidates. Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

g_i(u) u^i = u^i g_i(u)
for real numbers.  The summation and the additive term g(0) are identical.

The only difference between the two candidates is the notation “log (3)” versus “ln 3”.  
In typical mathematical usage—especially in calculus and analysis contexts where “ln” is explicitly used as well—“log” without a base is understood to be the natural logarithm (base e). Thus

log (3) = ln 3.

Both candidates then represent exactly the same numerical value:

Candidate 1: log (3) − 1/4  
Candidate 2: ln 3 − 1/4

Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.
The two answers are

Candidate 1:  log(3) − ¼  
Candidate 2:  ln 3 − ¼

“ln 3” is unambiguously the natural logarithm.  
“log(3)” is ambiguous: in mathematics it can denote either the natural logarithm or a base-10 logarithm (especially in problems already involving powers of 10, as here). Because different bases give different numerical values, multiple reasonable interpretations exist. Hence Candidate 1 leaves an essential ambiguity that Candidate 2 does not have.

Since the omission of the logarithm base in Candidate 1 causes potential confusion and the two expressions are not guaranteed to be the same, the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers both give the integral’s value as \(5\pi\phi\) (where \(\phi\) is the golden ratio). Candidate 1 writes it explicitly as “\(I = 5\pi\,\phi\)” and restates the definition of \(\phi\); Candidate 2 simply writes “5πφ.” These represent the exact same mathematical quantity.

Both candidates can be rewritten in the same form:

Candidate 1:
2 ln(2/r) − γ = 2(ln 2 − ln r) − γ = 2 ln 2 − 2 ln r − γ.

Candidate 2:
− γ − 2 ln(r/2) = − γ − 2(ln r − ln 2) = − γ − 2 ln r + 2 ln 2 = 2 ln 2 − 2 ln r − γ.

The two expressions are identical after simplification. Therefore, the candidates are equivalent.

The quantity being asked for is a vector in ℝ² (the integral of x^⊥ over the unit circle).  

• Candidate 1 answers with the scalar “0”.  
• Candidate 2 answers with the vector “(0, 0)”.

A scalar zero and a zero vector are different mathematical objects; there is no explicit indication that Candidate 1’s “0” is meant to denote a vector.  
Under Rule 6 (type mismatch) they are therefore not considered equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers represent the vanishing result of the integral.  
Although Candidate 1 writes simply “0” (a scalar symbol) and Candidate 2 explicitly writes the zero vector “(0, 0)”, in mathematical writing it is standard to denote the zero element of any vector space just by “0” when the context makes the type clear.  
Here the integrand is a vector field, so the context implies that “0” in Candidate 1 means the zero vector. Thus the two responses convey the same result.

The two expressions are clearly different:

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
(1/24) ln 2 + (1/16) ln π + (1/4) ln A − (7/32) ζ(3)/π².

Candidate 2, using ζ′(−1)=1/12−ln A, simplifies to  
1/24 + (1/8) ln 2 + (1/8) ln π − (3/4) ln A.

They contain different coefficients of ln A, different log terms, Candidate 2 has a constant 1/24 absent in Candidate 1, and Candidate 1 includes a ζ(3)/π² term absent in Candidate 2. Hence they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single formula intended to return the same quantity – the (unsigned) count of isolated real zeros of f on [a,b].

•  Candidate 1 writes that number as a winding/argument‐change expression involving  
  f, f′, f″ (with a final “round’’ to an integer).

•  Candidate 2 writes it as the distributional identity  
     N = ∫ₐᵇ δ(f(x)) |f′(x)| dx ,  
  which is the standard Dirac-delta way of counting isolated roots (each root contributes 1).

For a smooth function with isolated zeros (the setting of the problem), both expressions evaluate to the same integer N for every admissible f. They are just two analytically different but mathematically equivalent ways to compute the same count.

Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value (the maximum deviation) expressed in angular measure.

Candidate 1: “6 min”  
• Unit: arcminutes.  
• Convert to arcseconds: 6 × 60 = 360 arcsec.

Candidate 2: “≈ 355 seconds of arc”  
• Unit: arcseconds.  
• Value: 355 arcsec.

Comparing the two numerical results in the same unit (arcseconds):  
360 arcsec vs. 355 arcsec differ by 5 arcsec.  
Per Rule 4, real-number answers must match to 6 significant digits to be considered the same; 360.000 and 355.000 do not match.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical result for the range, but:

• Candidate 1: “202 km” (explicitly kilometres).  
• Candidate 2: “201398.5” (no unit stated).  
  – If interpreted as metres → 201 398.5 m = 201.3985 km, which differs from 202.000 km at the third significant digit (fails Rule 4).  
  – If interpreted as kilometres → 201 398.5 km, vastly different.

Because Candidate 2 omits the unit (Rule 1) and, under any reasonable interpretation, its value is not identical to Candidate 1’s to 6 significant digits (Rule 4), the two answers are not equivalent.

The numerical value of Candidate 2  
γ = 2√5 / 3 ≈ 1.490712 …

Expressed to six significant digits: 1.49071.

Candidate 1 gives 1.4907, which when padded to six significant digits is 1.490700.

Since 1.490700 ≠ 1.490710 at the sixth significant digit, the two answers do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4).  
Thus the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates both state the answer as 9.90 years (candidate 1 writes “9.90 year,” candidate 2 writes “9.90 years”).  
Same numerical value (9.90000 vs. 9.90000) and same unit (years). Therefore they are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

The two candidates give different physical quantities.

• Candidate 1: “0.7854 s” – a time interval (the period).

• Candidate 2: “4/π Hz” ≈ 1.27324 s⁻¹ – a frequency.

Period and frequency are reciprocals, not the same quantity. Although 1 / 0.7854 s ≈ 1.27324 Hz (numerically matching Candidate 2), Candidate 1 explicitly states the answer in seconds, not in hertz, so the two answers are not the same prediction.

Both candidates give the same numerical value 258.14.  
• Candidate 1: “258.14 $” (i.e., \$258.14)  
• Candidate 2: “258.14” (implicit dollars)

The question clearly expects a dollar amount for the monthly payment, so omitting the symbol “\$” in Candidate 2 does not create ambiguity.  
Comparing the numbers: 258.14 = 258.140000 (to six significant digits) for both.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value of t.  
Both candidates give a single number with the implicit same unit (time).

Compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 10.065778 → 10.0658 (6 sig. fig.)  
• Candidate 2: 10.07 → 10.0700 (6 sig. fig.)

10.0658 ≠ 10.0700, so the two predictions are not identical to 6 significant digits.

Candidate 1: 0.2244 s  
Candidate 2: π/14 s

Numeric value of π/14 ≈ 0.224399 s.

Express both answers to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.224400  
• Candidate 2: 0.224399

The two values differ at the sixth significant digit, so they do not match to six‐digit precision. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
0.2244 s  ≠  π/14 s  
(0.224400 vs. 0.224399 differ at the 6-significant-digit level)

The two answers give the same numerical value (0.0408), but Candidate 2 explicitly supplies the required unit “kg /m,” whereas Candidate 1 provides no unit at all.  
Because the drag-coefficient’s unit is essential and omitting it leaves the quantity ambiguous, Rule 1 says the answers are not considered equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers are single numerical values (units implied as time).  
Expressed to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 10.7598  
• Candidate 2: 10.7600  

They differ beginning at the fourth significant digit (…7598 vs …7600).  
Rule 4 requires identity up to six significant digits for equivalence, which is not satisfied.

The two candidates give numeric answers for the amplitude, but in different units.

1. Convert Candidate 1 from feet to inches:
   0.18162 ft × 12 in/ft = 2.17944 in.

2. Candidate 2 already gives the value in inches:
   √19 / 2 in ≈ 4.358898944 / 2 ≈ 2.179449472 in.

3. Compare to six significant digits (Rule 4):
   • Candidate 1: 2.17944 0 in  (pad with a zero to reach six significant digits → 2.17944 0)  
   • Candidate 2: 2.17945 in (rounded from 2.17944947…)

These differ in the 6th significant digit (…440 vs …450).  
Hence the two answers are not identical to six-significant-digit precision, so they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Reasoning:

• Both candidates give a single numerical time answer in minutes (candidate 1 explicitly “min”, candidate 2 implicitly; the question only uses minutes, so the units match).

• Compare the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
  – Candidate 1: 130.400766848 → 6-significant-digit rounded value = 130.401  
  – Candidate 2: 130.4 → 6-significant-digit value = 130.400

Since 130.401 ≠ 130.400, the answers do not agree to 6 significant digits.

Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical ratio.  
Both candidates give one numerical value and no units.

• Candidate 1: “4.16 $10^{42}$”  
• Candidate 2: “4.16 × 10^{42}”

Candidate 1 clearly intends scientific notation, using LaTeX math mode for the power of ten but omitting the explicit “×”. This is a common formatting slip; it still denotes 4.16 × 10^{42}.  
Thus both answers represent the same number: 4.16000 × 10^{42} (identical through at least six significant digits, satisfying Rule 4).

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for the electric field (a vector quantity).  
Candidate 2 supplies both the magnitude (2.50 × 10⁴ N/C) and the direction (“radially outward”), while Candidate 1 gives only the magnitude (2.50 × 10⁴ N/C) with no direction indicated. Because an essential part of a vector answer (the direction) is missing from Candidate 1, the two responses are not equivalent per Rule 2/Rule 9.

The two answers both state the same numerical value and the same unit:

• Candidate 1: “5.1 10² N” (standard shorthand for 5.1 × 10² N = 510 N)  
• Candidate 2: “5.1 × 10² N” (= 510 N)

Same unit (newtons) and same value to all significant digits. Hence they are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

The question expects a numerical coordinate with the proper unit (centimetres, since the given points are in cm).  

Candidate 1 gives “−1.0 cm,” explicitly specifying the unit.  
Candidate 2 gives “−1.0” with no unit, leaving it unclear whether this value is in centimetres, metres, or some other unit.

Because one answer omits the unit while multiple units could reasonably be used for a length, the omission introduces ambiguity. According to Rule 1, the two answers are therefore not considered equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question asks for the magnitude of an electric field, which must be expressed with appropriate units (e.g., N / C or V / m).  

• Candidate 1: “47 N / C” – supplies both the numerical value and an explicit unit.  
• Candidate 2: “47” – gives only the numerical value, omitting any unit.

Because electric‐field values can legitimately be reported in more than one unit system (N / C or V / m), the omission of a unit introduces ambiguity under Rule 1. Therefore, the two answers are not considered equivalent.

Both correspond to 1.70000 × 10^8 N to six significant digits. Hence, they are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value and the same unit:

• Candidate 2: 5.3 × 10⁷ N/C → 5.30000 × 10⁷  

Since 5.40000 × 10⁷ ≠ 5.30000 × 10⁷, they differ already in the first significant digit after the decimal.  
By Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

Reasoning:

• Both candidates give a single numerical multiple of L, so the units (length) match – we just need to compare the numerical factors.

• Candidate 1: 2.72 L  → numerical factor = 2.720000 (to 6 significant digits).

• Candidate 2: (5 + √10)/3 L  
  √10 ≈ 3.162277660…  
  (5 + √10)/3 ≈ 2.72075922 → to 6 significant digits: 2.72076.

• Compare the two factors digit-by-digit up to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
  – Candidate 1: 2.72000  
  – Candidate 2: 2.72076  
  They differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits.

Since they do not match to 6 significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent.

 14 eV × 96.485 kJ mol⁻¹ eV⁻¹ = 1350.79 kJ mol⁻¹.

Candidate 2: 1350 kJ mol⁻¹.

Expressed with six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 1350.79 kJ mol⁻¹  
Candidate 2 → 1350.00 kJ mol⁻¹.

Because 1350.79 ≠ 1350.00 at six significant digits, the two predictions do not match exactly per Rule 4.

• Candidate 1: 1.6 μm = 1.6 × 1000 nm = 1600 nm  
• Candidate 2: 808 nm

Since 1600 nm and 808 nm are clearly different (they do not match to six significant digits), the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers give a single numerical value for the wavelength, but:

1. Candidate 1 explicitly includes a unit: 1.6 μm = 1600 nm.
2. Candidate 2 gives “1616” with no unit, which is ambiguous (Rule 1).  

Even if we assume Candidate 2 means nanometres, 1600 nm and 1616 nm differ (1.60000 × 10³ vs 1.61600 × 10³), so they do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4).

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

According to Rule 2, the question effectively has two requested items:

1. The calculated energy per mole.  
2. A comparison of that energy with 400 kJ /mol.

• Candidate 2 supplies both items (“399 kJ/mol; nearly equal to 400 kJ/mol”).  
• Candidate 1 supplies only the first item (“399 kJ/mol”) and omits the explicit comparison.

Because Candidate 1 fails to provide one of the required parts, the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has two tasks:  
(1) give the energy per mole of 300-nm photons, and  
(2) compare that value with the reference 400 kJ mol⁻¹.

Candidate 1 only supplies the energy “399 kJ mol⁻¹” but omits the required comparison.  
Candidate 2 supplies the same energy “399 kJ mol⁻¹” and explicitly states the comparison “comparable to 400 kJ mol⁻¹.”

Because Candidate 1 fails to provide one of the required pieces of information, while Candidate 2 provides both, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two answers are not the same.

• Candidate 1 gives a numerical angle of 54.7 °, i.e. 54.700000 to six significant digits.

• Candidate 2 gives the expression arccos(1/√3).  Numerically, arccos(1/√3) ≈ 54.7356 ° (or ≈ 0.955317 rad if interpreted in radians).

Even if both are interpreted in degrees, 54.700000 and 54.735610 differ at the fourth significant digit, so they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.  
Moreover, Candidate 2 does not specify units, introducing additional ambiguity per Rule 1.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical ratio.  
Candidate 1 gives “2 × 10^39” (interpreting the space as the multiplication sign).  
Candidate 2 gives “2.27 × 10^39”.

Expressed with the same exponent, the numbers are:

• Candidate 1: 2.00000 × 10^39  
• Candidate 2: 2.27000 × 10^39  

Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4), 2.00000 ≠ 2.27000.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The Bohr magneton is  
μ_B = 9.274 01 × 10⁻²⁴ J T⁻¹.

Candidate 2 gives √3 μ_B ⇒ √3 × 9.274 01 × 10⁻²⁴ ≈ 1.60574 × 10⁻²³ J T⁻¹.

Candidate 1 is 1.61 × 10⁻²³ J T⁻¹, which expressed to six significant digits is 1.61000 × 10⁻²³ J T⁻¹.

Comparing the two numbers at six significant digits (Rule 4):
1.61000 ≠ 1.60574.

Because the values differ within the first six significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers give a value in the same units (J/T).  
Convert each to 6 significant digits with the same exponent:

• Candidate 1: 1.61 × 10⁻²³ → 1.61000 × 10⁻²³  
• Candidate 2: 1.6063 × 10⁻²³ → 1.60630 × 10⁻²³

Comparing the six significant digits: 1.61000 vs 1.60630 differ starting at the third digit, so they do not match to 6 significant figures.

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a single numerical value (0.323) with no indication of how it depends on a.  
Candidate 2 gives a general analytical expression 1 − (1 + 2a/a₀ + 2a²/a₀²) e^{−2a/a₀} that produces the probability as a function of a. 

A single number cannot, in general, represent the entire function. Although the number 0.323 matches the function’s value when a = a₀, the question asks for the probability for an arbitrary distance a, so the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the value of the spherical harmonic \(Y_0^{0}(\theta,\phi)\).

• Candidate 2 states it explicitly as \(Y_0^{0} = 1/\sqrt{4\pi}\).

• Numerically, \(1/\sqrt{4\pi} = 1/(2\sqrt{\pi}) \approx 0.282094791\ldots\).

• Candidate 1 provides the number \(0.28209479\).

The two expressions are dimensionless numbers and match to at least six significant digits (0.282094), fulfilling Rule 4. Hence they represent the same value.

P(Y ≥ X + 2) = ∑_{k=27}^{50} C(50,k)(½)^{50}.  
Its exact numerical value is ≈ 0.3359056.

Candidate 1 gives the value 0.3359, which corresponds to 0.335900 when written with six significant digits.

0.335900 (from Candidate 1) ≠ 0.335906 (value of Candidate 2) at the sixth significant digit, so by Rule 4 the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical answers.

Candidate 1: 0.0182  
Candidate 2: 27 / (10 e⁵)

Compute Candidate 2 numerically:
e⁵ ≈ 148.4131591  
27 / (10 e⁵) ≈ 27 / 1484.13159 ≈ 0.0181924

Express both numbers to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 0.0182000  
• Candidate 2 → 0.0181924

They differ at the 3rd significant digit (…820000 vs …81924…).  
By Rule 4 (must match to 6 significant digits), the answers are not equivalent.
We compare the numerical values.

Candidate 1: 0.0182  
To 6 significant digits → 0.0182000 (1.82000 × 10⁻²)

Candidate 2: (27/10) e^{−5}  
27/10 = 2.7  
e^{−5} ≈ 0.006737947  
Product ≈ 0.0181920 (1.81920 × 10⁻²)

Six-digit comparison:
1.82000 × 10⁻²  vs.  1.81920 × 10⁻²

They differ at the 4th significant digit, so they are not identical to 6 significant digits. Hence, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical probabilities.

Candidate 1: 0.0000092 = 9.20000 × 10⁻⁶ (expressed to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 1/108290 ≈ 0.00000923446 = 9.23446 × 10⁻⁶ (to 6 significant digits)

Comparing the two values digit-by-digit at 6 significant-digit precision, 9.23446 ≠ 9.20000.  
Hence the two answers are not the same number.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers give different numerical probabilities.

Candidate 1: 0.0000092 = 9.20000 × 10⁻⁶ (to six significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 1/108 290 ≈ 0.00000923456 = 9.23456 × 10⁻⁶ (to six significant digits)

Since 9.20000 × 10⁻⁶ ≠ 9.23456 × 10⁻⁶, the predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates provide single numerical probabilities.

Candidate 1: 0.444444444444444  
Candidate 2: 41/90 = 0.455555…  

Comparing to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 0.444444  
• Candidate 2 → 0.455556  

Since 0.444444 ≠ 0.455556, the answers are not the same.

The two answers give the pressure in different units, so convert one to the other.

1 atm = 101.325 kPa  
Candidate 1: 1.95 atm × 101.325 kPa/atm = 197.58375 kPa  

Now compare to Candidate 2’s 198 kPa.

Express both to six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 197.584 kPa  
Candidate 2 → 198.000 kPa

They differ already at the third significant digit (197.584 vs 198.000), so the two predictions are not equal to six significant digits. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the vapor pressure in different units, but these can be converted to the same unit (Pa):

• Candidate 1: 1.51 × 10³ Pa = 1510 Pa  
• Candidate 2: 0.0150 bar = 0.0150 × 10⁵ Pa = 1500 Pa

Expressed with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.51000 × 10³ Pa  
• Candidate 2: 1.50000 × 10³ Pa

The digits differ after the second decimal place, so the two answers do not match to six significant digits, as required by Rule 4. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The question requires a single numerical diffusion‐coefficient value (with units).  
• Candidate 1: 1.06 × 10⁻⁵ m² s⁻¹ → 1.06000 × 10⁻⁵ (six sig. digits).  
• Candidate 2: 1.1 × 10⁻⁵ m² s⁻¹ → 1.10000 × 10⁻⁵ (six sig. digits).

Comparing 1.06000 and 1.10000 at six significant digits shows a difference in the second digit. Per Rule 4, the results must be identical to six significant digits to be considered equivalent. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question requires a single numerical fraction.  

Candidate 1 gives 0.132.  
Candidate 2 gives 0.135.

Expressed to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 0.132000  
• Candidate 2: 0.135000  

Since 0.132000 ≠ 0.135000, the two answers are different.

Both candidates give a single numerical answer for the ionic strength.

• Numerical value: 0.321 in each case (0.321000 vs. 0.321000 — identical to ≥6 significant digits).

• Units:  
  – Candidate 1: “mol kg⁻¹”  
  – Candidate 2: “m” (lower-case “m”, which the problem itself uses to denote mol kg⁻¹, i.e., molality).

Since “m” is the same unit used in the question for molality and is equivalent to mol kg⁻¹, the units match.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives “655 K,” explicitly specifying Kelvin.  
Candidate 2 gives just “655” with no unit.  
Because temperature can be expressed in more than one unit (Kelvin, Celsius, etc.), omitting the unit introduces ambiguity. Under Rule 1, this makes the two answers inequivalent.

The question asks for a temperature, so a unit is required (normally Kelvin in this context).  

• Candidate 1 gives a numerical value “5.85 10^4” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “5.85 × 10^4 K”, explicitly specifying Kelvin.

Because Candidate 1 omits the unit, there is ambiguity—temperatures can be expressed in different units (Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit). Under Rule 1, such an omission makes the answers inequivalent.

The two candidates both give the value 4.16 × 10⁻⁴ (candidate 1’s space in “4.16  10⁻⁴” is standard LaTeX adjacency meaning multiplication).  
No units are involved, and only one numerical answer is required.

The two candidates give the age in different units (seconds vs. years), so first convert Candidate 1 to years:

4.86 × 10¹¹ s ÷ 3.15576 × 10⁷ s / yr ≈ 1.53939 × 10⁴ yr ≈ 15 394 yr.

Now compare to Candidate 2’s 15 400 yr.  
Express both to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.53939 × 10⁴ yr  
• Candidate 2: 1.54000 × 10⁴ yr  

They differ in the fourth significant digit (…939 vs …000), so they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives 4.86 × 10¹¹ s.

Convert Candidate 2’s 15 400 years to seconds:
15 400 yr × (3.1536 × 10⁷ s/yr) ≈ 4.85654 × 10¹¹ s.

Compare to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 4.86000 × 10¹¹ s  
• Candidate 2: 4.85654 × 10¹¹ s  

They differ beginning with the third significant digit (4.86000 vs 4.85654), so the values are not identical to six significant digits. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Expressed with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.10000 × 10⁻⁵ m² s⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 1.03000 × 10⁻⁵ m² s⁻¹

Since 1.10000 × 10⁻⁵ ≠ 1.03000 × 10⁻⁵ at six significant digits, the answers are not equal (Rule 4).

Candidate 2: 53 days.

52 days ≠ 53 days (difference ≈ 1 day ≈ 2 %).  
Expressed in the same units, 4.49000 × 10^6 s ≠ 4.57920 × 10^6 s, so they do not match to six significant digits.

The question requests TWO separate values of the limit:  
• one for the case r = s,  
• one for the case r ≠ s.

Candidate 1 supplies both required cases:  
– limit = φ(r) when r = s,  
– limit = 0 when r ≠ s.

Candidate 2 gives only a single value φ(r) with no distinction, thus omitting the r ≠ s case.

Since Candidate 2 does not provide all answers required by the problem, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates give different formulas.

• Candidate 1 assigns rank 1 whenever \(C_{(1)}(M)\neq 0\) (e.g. for a pure vector).  
• Candidate 2 looks only at the highest non-zero grade in \(T=M^\dagger M\).  For a pure vector \(M\), \(T\) is a scalar, so every \(C_{(j)}(T)\) with \(j\ge 1\) is zero; Candidate 2 would then return 0 (or be undefined), not 1.

Hence the two expressions cannot agree in general.

•  Candidate 2 gives
  F₂(z,q)= (q; q)∞⁻¹ ∑_{k∈ℤ} z^k q^{k²} ,
 whose constant coefficient equals 1 ∕ (q; q)∞ ≠ 1.

Since the very first coefficient already differs, the two series (and thus the generating functions) cannot be equivalent.

The two candidates give exactly the same criterion:

• If the series \( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \psi(n)(\log n)^{k-1} \) converges, they both say \( \lambda_k(W_k^\times(\psi)) = 0\).

• If that series diverges, they both say \( \lambda_k(W_k^\times(\psi)) = 1\).

Hence their answers are equivalent.

• Candidate 2: \(\log_2(1+\overline\gamma_b)-\log_2(1+\overline\gamma_e)\)

Candidate 2 contains no \(g_b\), \(g_e\), or \(\overline\rho\), whereas the question explicitly asks for the answer in terms of those variables. Hence the two answers are not mathematically or symbolically equivalent.

which simplifies to  
m = n (r − 2) + 2.

Candidate 2  
1. 1 / [(q;q⁴)∞ (q³;q⁴)∞]  
2. 1 / [(q²;q⁴)∞]²

These pairs of products involve different step sizes (q⁶ vs. q⁴) and completely different lists of factors; there is no standard identity equating them. Thus the answers are not the same.

3. For the infinite families, candidate 1’s formulas involve factors (n−1) and μ(λ+μ)/(λ+3μ), whereas candidate 2’s use n and (λ+μ) without the μ/(λ+3μ) factor.

Because the eigenvalue sets and their multiplicities are not the same, the answers are not equivalent.

Thus every summand in Candidate 2 is multiplied by the extra factor gcd(d², δ²) compared with Candidate 1.

The two expressions are

Candidate 1: cₙ,ₛ · (A² + 16 ξ²)^{−(n+s+1)/2}

Candidate 2: cₙ,ₛ · π · (ξ² + (A/2)²)^{−(n+s+1)/2}
             = cₙ,ₛ · π · (A²/4 + ξ²)^{−(n+s+1)/2}
             = cₙ,ₛ · π · 4^{(n+s+1)/2} · (A² + 4 ξ²)^{−(n+s+1)/2}

Comparing the factors inside the parentheses:

• Candidate 1 has (A² + 16 ξ²).
• Candidate 2 (after factoring) has (A² + 4 ξ²) multiplied by an overall constant 4^{(n+s+1)/2}·π.

Because the ξ² coefficients (16 vs 4) differ, the two expressions cannot be made identical by any overall constant factor; they would only coincide for special values of ξ (e.g., ξ = 0), not in general. Hence the answers are not equivalent.
The two expressions inside the parentheses are different:

• Candidate 1 uses A² + 16 ξ²  
• Candidate 2 uses ξ² + (A/2)² = ξ² + A²/4

Because these differ by factors that depend on both A and ξ, and the prefactor c_{n,s} is the same fixed constant in each answer, the overall results are not the same functions of the parameters.

These are clearly not the same; Candidate 1 contains an extra factor 1/(K − 1) and an additional term involving ‖𝔤ₙ(Tₙ)‖²_F, while Candidate 2 includes only the Frobenius norm of the gradient. Hence they are inequivalent.

Because Candidate 1 does not include the “max over r” that appears in Candidate 2, the two formulas can differ whenever some other residue class gives a strictly larger sum than the one that contains ⌊n/2⌋.  Hence the two expressions are not guaranteed to be equal in general.

The two expressions differ.

• Candidate 1 selects the residue class  r ≡ ⌊n/2⌋ (mod t+1) and sums over those dimensions only.  
• Candidate 2 states the sum over a residue class r but leaves r arbitrary (“for some integer r with 0 ≤ r ≤ t”).

Because Candidate 2 does not specify the same fixed residue class as Candidate 1 (indeed, it allows any of them), the two formulas do not coincide in general. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single explicit formula for β₁(J_G) in terms of the listed parameters.  

• Candidate 1 supplies a long expression that depends on n, m, the sum of binomial terms over degrees of vertices not in K_m, etc.  
• Candidate 2 supplies the very simple value (m − 1)(m − 2)/2, which involves only m and ignores n and all of the various degree terms.

The two formulas clearly differ; there is no algebraic way for Candidate 1’s expression (which varies with n and individual vertex degrees) to equal Candidate 2’s simple function of m alone for every admissible graph. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different algebraic expressions for β₁(J_G).  
Candidate 1 is a long sum of many binomial‐coefficient terms (including terms like \(\binom{\deg_G w}{3}\), \(\binom{n-1}{2}\), etc.), while Candidate 2 is a single, much simpler expression that is only linear in the degrees and does not contain any \(\binom{\;\;}{3}\) or \(\binom{\;\;}{2}\) terms. These formulas clearly cannot be algebraically identical for arbitrary values of the parameters.

The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 2: γ_tr(C_n) = ⌊2n/3⌋

For n = 8 (as a simple check with n ≥ 4):

• Candidate 1: 8 – 2⌊8/4⌋ = 8 – 2·2 = 4  
• Candidate 2: ⌊2·8/3⌋ = ⌊16/3⌋ = 5

Since the results differ (4 vs. 5), the two formulas cannot be identical for all n. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give expressions that share the same elementary prefactors  
(2π)^{n/2} (β/2)^{-[β n(n-1)/4 + n/2]}.

For the remaining gamma-function part,

Candidate 2: ∏_{j=1}^n Γ(1 + jβ/2) / Γ(1 + β/2)  
     = ∏_{j=1}^n [(jβ/2) Γ(jβ/2)] / [(β/2) Γ(β/2)]  
     = n! (β/2)^n ∏_{j=1}^n Γ(jβ/2) / [(β/2)^n Γ(β/2)^n]  
     = n! Γ(β/2)^{-n} ∏_{j=1}^n Γ(jβ/2).

This equals exactly the gamma-factor appearing in Candidate 1:
 n! Γ(β/2)^{-n} ∏_{j=1}^n Γ(jβ/2).

Hence the two formulas are identical:

Candidate 1 = Candidate 2.

 Candidate 2: (c+1)/2 = (5+1)/2 = 3  

The results differ (2 vs 3).  Since the formulas yield different values for at least one admissible c, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas.

• Candidate 1’s expression depends only on Q² (every occurrence of Q is squared or inside an even function of Q). Therefore 𝒮(Q) is an even function of Q and its first derivative at Q = 0 is 0.

• Candidate 2’s expression 𝒮(Q)=𝒮+2 arctanh (Q) is not even in Q; its derivative at Q = 0 equals 2, not 0.

Because the functional dependence on Q differs (odd part present in Candidate 2 but absent in Candidate 1), the two answers cannot be equivalent.

They are not the same expression (even modulo 2, Candidate 2 includes the C(h,0), C(h,1), C(h,2) terms that Candidate 1 lacks). Evaluating at specific values of h (e.g., h=1 or h=3) yields different results. Therefore the answers are inequivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
σ(G) = (m n p – 1)! · [∏_{i=1}^{m+n+p-1} b_i] ÷ [∏_{i=1}^{m-1} b_i  · ∏_{i=1}^{n-1} b_i · ∏_{i=1}^{p-1} b_i].

Candidate 2 gives  
σ(G) = (m n p)! ÷ [∏_{i=1}^{m+n+p-1} b_i].

These two formulas differ in several clear ways:

1. Factorial: Candidate 1 has (mnp – 1)! whereas Candidate 2 has (mnp)!.
2. Placement of the product ∏ b_i: it is in the numerator for Candidate 1 and in the denominator for Candidate 2 (they are reciprocals).
3. Candidate 1 contains additional factors in its denominator (products over the first m–1, n–1, and p–1 indices) that are completely absent in Candidate 2.

Because of these discrepancies, the two expressions cannot be algebraically identical for general m, n, p. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:  σ(G) = ∏_{i=1}^{m+n+p−1} b_i.

Candidate 2 lacks the factorial terms and the denominator factors appearing in Candidate 1, so the two expressions disagree for generic m,n,p. Hence they are not equivalent.

2. Candidate 2:      \|\widetilde{\mathbf{H}}^{\mu,\nu}_{\alpha,\beta}\| = B\!\left(\alpha+\mu+\frac1{p'},\,\beta+\nu+\frac1p\right)

The first is a rational combination of the parameters; the second is a Beta-function value depending on different combinations of the parameters. They are not algebraically the same, nor numerically convertible by a simple identity. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

   \dfrac{\Gamma\!\bigl(\dfrac{1+\mu}{p}\bigr)\,
          \Gamma\!\bigl(\dfrac{1+\nu}{p'}\bigr)}

The two candidates give different formulas for both requested quantities:

   • Candidate 2: \( 1-\dfrac{1}{S_N}\)

2. Parameter \(\epsilon\)
   • Candidate 1: \( \dfrac{S_N-1}{2(N-1)}\)  
   • Candidate 2: \( \dfrac{1}{S_N}\)

These expressions are not algebraically the same (they do not reduce to one another for general \(N\) and \(S_N\)). Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different explicit formulas for both 
1) the minimum loss \(L_{\text{min}}\) and  
2) the parameter \(\epsilon\).

Candidate 1 includes factors \(\frac{N}{2(N-1)}\) in \(L_{\text{min}}\) and \(\frac{1}{2(N-1)}\) in \(\epsilon\), whereas Candidate 2 lacks these factors.  
These two sets of expressions coincide only for special (non-generic) values of \(N\) (e.g., \(N=2\) for \(L_{\text{min}}\)), but the question is stated for general \(N\). Hence, the answers are not mathematically equivalent.

The numerical value of Candidate 1 is  
−(log 3)/(log 5) ≈ −0.682606.  

Candidate 2 gives −0.6826, which we interpret as −0.682600 when extended to six significant digits.

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: −0.682606  
• Candidate 2: −0.682600  

They differ in the 6th significant digit (…06 vs …00).  
Hence, according to Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give exactly the same piecewise answer:

• For \(n \equiv 0 \pmod{12}\): surface-crossing number \(= 6g\).

• For \(n \equiv 6 \pmod{12}\): surface-crossing number \(= 6g-3\).

c)  Candidate 1: I = { j₁–1, …, j_k–1 }.  
  Candidate 2: I = { j₁, j₂, …, j_k }.

Both candidates supply two formulas, but those formulas are clearly different:

Candidate 1

Candidate 2

• 𝓛(Q′ₙ(8,4)) = μⁿ − νⁿ

The factors 2 n and the ± 2 constants in Candidate 1 are absent in Candidate 2, and the second expression of Candidate 2 has a different sign pattern. No simple unit conversion or algebraic identity makes these expressions identical. Hence the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas:

• Candidate 1: m^{α(G)} · [ Σ_{i=1}^{r(G)} (∏_{x_j∈L₂(C_i)} w(x_j)) ] · C(α(G)+s−1, s−1)

• Candidate 2: r(G) · (ms)^{α(G)}

These expressions depend on the parameters m, s, weights w(x_j), and the binomial coefficient in completely different ways. Unless very special extra conditions were imposed (e.g., all weights equal 1, L₂(C_i) empty, and s^{α(G)} equaling the binomial coefficient, which is not generally true), the two formulas are not the same.

Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same rational function.

Candidate 1  
G₁(q) = 1/(1-q) + q²/[(1-q)²(1-q²)]  
    = (1 – q + q³) / [(1-q)³(1+q)]

Candidate 2  
G₂(q) = (q⁵ + 2q⁴ – q² + q + 1) / (1-q²)³  
    = (1 – q + q³)(1+q)² / (1-q²)³   (since (1+q)² = 1 + 2q + q²)

But (1-q²)³ = (1-q)³(1+q)³, so

G₁(q) = (1 – q + q³)(1+q)² / (1-q²)³ = G₂(q).

Thus the two expressions are algebraically identical, hence equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
 2 d₍GH₎(λ Δₙ, X) = inf_{D∈𝓓ₙ(X)} max{ diam D, λ – α(D), diam X – λ }.

Candidate 2 gives  
 2 d₍GH₎(λ Δₙ, X) = max{ diam X – λ, diam D – λ + 2 α(D) }.

Differences:

1. Candidate 1 takes an infimum over D∈𝓓ₙ(X); Candidate 2 has no such infimum.
2. The sets inside the max are different: Candidate 1 uses diam D and λ – α(D); Candidate 2 uses diam D – λ + 2 α(D).

Because both the functional form and the presence of the infimum differ, the two expressions cannot be the same.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 states very specific equality conditions:

• Ω must be (up to measure-zero) a ball centered at some point (x₀, ω₀);
• f must be exactly a translation-and-modulation of the fixed Gaussian φ, namely  
  f(x)=c e^{2πixω₀} φ(x−x₀).

Hence the centre of the ball is tied to the translation/modulation parameters of f, and the Gaussian width is the one of φ.

Candidate 2 only says:

• f is “a Gaussian function” (without fixing its width or requiring any particular translation/modulation relation to Ω);
• Ω is “a ball in ℝ²” (without requiring its centre to match anything linked to f).

Because Candidate 2 omits the essential coupling between the centre of Ω and the time-frequency shift parameters of f (and does not fix the Gaussian’s width), it gives strictly weaker conditions than Candidate 1. Therefore the two answers are not the same.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reasoning:

• Candidate 1 specifies that equality holds precisely when  
  – Ω is (up to null sets) a ball centred at some point (x₀, ω₀); and  
  – f is c e^{2π i x ω₀} φ(x − x₀), i.e. a Gaussian window translated and modulated by (x₀, ω₀).

• Candidate 2 merely says that f is “a Gaussian function’’ and Ω is a ball.  
  It omits the necessary translation/modulation factor e^{2π i x ω₀} and the location (x₀, ω₀) of the ball, so it does not describe exactly the same class of extremisers.

Because Candidate 2 lacks these essential conditions, the answers differ.

The two candidates give different density functions.

• Candidate 1: f₁(x) = (1/(2π)) √(4 − x²), support |x| ≤ 2.  
• Candidate 2: f₂(x) = (2/π) √(1 − x²), support |x| ≤ 1 (implied by the square-root term).

These differ by a horizontal scaling of a factor 2 and therefore are not the same function of the variable x.  Consequently the predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different closed-form products.  
To make them match, Candidate 1’s expression would have to equal Candidate 2’s, i.e.

(u³;q³)∞ / (u;q)∞  =  (−u;q)∞(−u²;q)∞(u³;q³)∞

⇒ 1 = (−u;q)∞(−u²;q)∞(u;q)∞.

However  
(−u;q)∞(u;q)∞ = (u²;q²)∞,  
so the right-hand side becomes (u²;q²)∞(−u²;q)∞, which is not identically 1 (a quick numerical check already shows it differs from 1).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidate expressions give different results for general even \(s\) and odd \(t\):

  – Candidate 1 equals \(\binom{a+b}{a}+\binom{a+b-1}{a}\).  
  – Candidate 2 equals \((2a+1)b\).

Testing, e.g. \(s=4\,(a=1)\), \(t=5\,(b=2)\) gives
 Candidate 1: \( \binom{3}{1}+\binom{2}{1}=3+2=5\)  
 Candidate 2: \( (2\cdot1+1)\cdot2 = 3\cdot2 = 6\).

The two candidates give explicit closed-form expressions for the same single quantity, so we can directly test algebraic equality (Rules 1, 4, 8).

Candidate 1:  
1 + n + n² + [(n + 1)/2] · C(n + 2, 3)  
 = 1 + n + n² + [(n + 1)/2] · [(n + 2)(n + 1)n / 6]

This is a quartic polynomial in n (highest power n⁴).

Candidate 2:  
[(n + 1)(n + 2)]/2  
 = (n² + 3n + 2)/2,

which is only quadratic in n.

Because the degrees (and therefore the values) of these two polynomials differ, the expressions cannot be identical for general n. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

 S = k − e^{−kt} ∑_{s=0}^{k−1}(k−s)\,[L_s^{(−1)}(kt)]^{2}.  

Candidate 2 gives  
 S = e^{−kt}.  

These two formulas are plainly different: Candidate 1 contains an extra ‟k − …sum” structure with Laguerre-polynomial terms, while Candidate 2 is just the exponential e^{−kt}. There is no general algebraic identity that makes those two expressions identical for all k and t. Hence they are not equivalent.

The two candidates do not give the same distributions.

• Candidate 1 specifies an n-dimensional, zero-mean Gaussian whose covariance matrix is (P/n) Iₙ (so each coordinate has variance P/n and the total second moment ‖X‖² has expectation P).  It likewise chooses Z ~ N(0,(N/n) Iₙ).

• Candidate 2 states simply that X and Z are zero-mean Gaussians with variances P and N, respectively.  This corresponds to a **scalar** (or 1-dimensional) Gaussian with variance P (or, if one tried to interpret it component-wise, each coordinate would have variance P, giving total power nP, which violates the constraint).

Thus, except in the special case n = 1, the two answers describe different covariance structures and are not equivalent.  The question does not restrict n to 1, so the candidates must be regarded as giving different solutions.

Because the variances differ (except in the special case n = 1, which is not specified) the stated saddle-point distributions are not the same. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different Narayana numbers.

Candidate 1: \(N(m+n,n)=\frac1{m+n}\binom{m+n}{n}\binom{m+n}{\,n-1}\).

Candidate 2: \(N(m+n,m)=\frac1{m+n}\binom{m+n}{m}\binom{m+n}{\,m-1}\).

Although \(\binom{m+n}{n}=\binom{m+n}{m}\), the second binomial factors differ in general (\(\binom{m+n}{n-1}\) vs. \(\binom{m+n}{m-1}\)). The Narayana numbers satisfy \(N(k,r)=N(k,k-r+1)\), so \(N(m+n,n)=N(m+n,m+1)\), not \(N(m+n,m)\). Hence the two expressions are unequal for generic \(m,n\).

Both candidates give exactly the same product:

• They both take the product over j = 1,…, l (ℓ).  
• Inside, they both have the factor 1 / |Aut_{R_j}(G_j)|.  
• They both multiply by an infinite Euler product ∏_{i=1}^{∞} (1 – p^{-deg(P_j)·i}).  
  (Candidate 1 uses index i, candidate 2 uses k; this is just a dummy index.)

The order of the two factors inside the parentheses is irrelevant (multiplication is commutative), and the symbols i and k denote the same infinite range.

Hence the two expressions are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give an Euler–product expression for the same probability.  
For every fixed prime p and each corank i, the factor appearing in Candidate 1

  p-i² · ∏_{j=i+1}^{n}(1–p^{-j})² / ∏_{j=1}^{n-i}(1–p^{-j})

is exactly the probability that a random n × n matrix over 𝐅_p has corank i, which is

  (# of n × n matrices over 𝐅_p of rank n–i) / p^{n²} .

Summing those probabilities for i = 0,…,k and then taking the product over all primes gives
  ∏_{p} ∑_{r=n-k}^{n} (# of matrices of rank r)/p^{n²},

which is precisely Candidate 2.  Direct checks for several small values of (n,k) (e.g. (1,0), (1,1), (2,1)) confirm that the two formulas coincide.

Thus the two answers are mathematically the same expression written in different algebraic forms.

The two candidates give different coefficients in front of \(C_{cc}(H)\):

• Candidate 1: \(n(m-1) + 1\cdot C_{cc}(H)\)

• Candidate 2: \(n(m-1) + m\cdot C_{cc}(H)\)

Since \(m\neq 1\) for a non-trivial connected graph (and \(C_{cc}(H)\) is generally non-zero), these expressions are not the same in general.

The two candidate expressions are:

• Candidate 1: (m − 1) n + C_{cc}(H)

• Candidate 2: m C_{cc}(H) + n (m − 1)

Subtracting the first from the second gives  
m C_{cc}(H) + n (m − 1) − [(m − 1) n + C_{cc}(H)]  
= m C_{cc}(H) − C_{cc}(H)  
= (m − 1) C_{cc}(H),

which is zero only if m = 1 or C_{cc}(H)=0.  
Since the graphs are stated to be non-trivial connected graphs, m≠1 and C_{cc}(H) is not generally zero. Hence, the two expressions are not algebraically the same.

• Candidate 2:  det(Δ)= ∏_{k=1}^{n−1} det(W_k).

• Candidate 2 has none of those factors and instead includes a product of hat δ_i in the denominator.

Because the two formulas differ in multiple multiplicative factors (signs, powers of 2, powers of det W_i, and all dependence on hat δ_i), they are not algebraically equivalent.

The problem asks for TWO closed-form expressions, one for n = 2m – 1 (odd n) and one for n = 2m (even n).

  – For n = 2m – 1: d(n) = 2^m – 1  
  – For n = 2m: d(n) = 3·2^{m-1} – 1

• Candidate 2 supplies only a single expression: 3·2^{m-1} – 1 (implicitly for the even case). It provides nothing for the odd case.

Because the question requires two separate answers and Candidate 2 gives only one, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

\[
\calS(Q)=\ln\!\left(\frac{\sqrt{Q^{2}+a^{2}}+1}{\sqrt{Q^{2}+a^{2}}-1}\right).
\]

• Candidate 1 gives a much more complicated logarithmic fraction containing the auxiliary quantities  
\(b=Q^{2}+a^{2}-1\) and \(\sqrt{b^{2}+4Q^{2}}\).

Substituting concrete values (e.g. \(a\approx2.164,\;Q=0.5\) or \(a\approx1.313,\;Q=2\)) shows that the numerical results produced by the two expressions differ appreciably (≈0.97 vs 0.93 in the first test, ≈0.89 vs 0.41 in the second), so the formulas are not algebraically equivalent.

• For the long‐root multiplicity  
  – Candidate 1: \(k_{\text{long}} = \tfrac12\) (constant)  
  – Candidate 2: \(k_{\text{long}} = p-1\) (depends on \(p\))

These can only coincide for the special, non-integer value \(p=\tfrac32\); hence for the allowed integer values of \(p\) they are not equal. Because at least one requested quantity differs, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question requests two specific quantities, \(k_{\text{short}}\) and \(k_{\text{long}}\).

Candidate 1  
• \(k_{\text{short}} = \tfrac{|\,d-2-2p\,|}{2}\)  
• \(k_{\text{long}} = \tfrac12\)

Candidate 2  
• \(k_{\text{short}} = d-2p-2\)  
• \(k_{\text{long}} = 1\)

Comparison:

1. \(k_{\text{long}}\): 1/2 ≠ 1.  
2. \(k_{\text{short}}\): \(|d-2-2p|/2\) is generally not equal to \(d-2p-2\) (different absolute value, different factor of 1/2).

Since at least one of the requested sub-answers differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two proposed formulas are not the same.

Take the simple case n = 3 (odd) and d = 1 (an odd divisor of n):

 d = 1 ⇒ q = 1 only.  
 The inner sum has j = 0 only, giving value 1.  
 With the prefactor 1/d = 1, the whole expression equals 1.

• Candidate 2  
 d = 1 ⇒ k = 1 only.  
 (n/k)!! = 3!! = 3 × 1 = 3.  
 With the prefactor 1/d = 1, the whole expression equals 3.

Since the two formulas already give different numerical values for the same admissible (n,d), they cannot be equivalent.

1. A general formula for F(Dₙ) in terms of τ(n), π(n−1), π(n/2), γ_{n/2}(n).
2. The value of F(Dₙ) when n is prime.

Candidate 1 supplies

• Prime case: F(Dₙ)=π(n)−π(n/2)+1

Candidate 2 supplies
• Formula: F(Dₙ)=γ_{n/2}(n) (only)  
• Prime case: F(Dₙ)=2

The two formulas are clearly different (Candidate 2 omits the τ and π terms), and the prime-case values differ as well (π(n)−π(n/2)+1 vs. 2). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives

 ( 1 / |Aut(G)| ) · ∏_{j=1}^r φ_{|L_j^{t}|}(p^{k-a_j}).

Differences:

1. Candidate 1 contains an overall extra factor p^k that candidate 2 lacks.
2. Inside the products, candidate 1 includes, for each linked cell of size m, the product of φ_1, φ_2, …, φ_m, whereas candidate 2 includes only a single factor φ_m. These are generally not equal (the product of φ_1 through φ_m is not equal to φ_m alone).
3. The indexing structure in candidate 2 (mixing j and t) also does not match that of candidate 1.

Because of these substantial algebraic differences, the two expressions cannot be the same count.

The two expressions have the same overall prefactor  
  p ᵏ / |Aut(G)|,  
but differ in the product factor:

• Candidate 1 multiplies, for every linked cell L_j^t of size m = |L_j^t|, all terms  
  φ₁(p^{k-a_t}) φ₂(p^{k-a_t}) … φ_m(p^{k-a_t}).

• Candidate 2 multiplies, for every edge e in the spanning tree, only the term  
  φ₁(p^{k-a_e}).

Unless every linked cell has size 1 (so that φ₁ is the only factor needed), the two products are not equal; for a cell of size 2 or more,  
  φ₁² ≠ φ₁ φ₂, etc.

Hence the two candidates generally give different counts, and the formulas are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas:

• Candidate 1: Δ_can = −γ(Y)/4 + 1/2  
• Candidate 2: Δ_can = −γ(Y)

These expressions are equal only if −γ(Y)/4 + 1/2 = −γ(Y), which would force γ(Y) to be the constant −2/3 for every manifold Y, an assumption not stated in the problem and generally false. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates propose different formulas for the length \(\ell(\pi)\).

• Candidate 1: \(\displaystyle \ell(\pi)=\sum_{j=1}^{m} k_{j}\,i_{k_{j}}-\bigl(\operatorname{maj}(\pi)\bigr)^{2}\).

• Candidate 2: \(\displaystyle \ell(\pi)=\operatorname{maj}(\pi)\).

These expressions are not algebraically identical (and will not coincide for generic positive integers \(k_j,i_{k_j}\)). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for the Conley–Zehnder index as an integer expressed in terms of the signature of S (the difference between the numbers of positive and negative eigenvalues).

Candidate 1: ½ · signature(S)  
Candidate 2: ½ · sign(S)

“signature(S)” is the required integer.  
“sign(S)” is ambiguous and is usually interpreted either as
• the sign of det S (±1), or  
• the matrix sign function, not an integer.

Neither of those equals the signature in general, so the two expressions cannot be assumed to represent the same quantity. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different \(q\)-series.

• Candidate 1  
\[
(-\sqrt{2};q)_\infty \;=\;(1+\sqrt{2})\Bigl(1+\sqrt{2}q+\sqrt{2}q^{2}+O(q^{3})\Bigr)
      \;=\;(1+\sqrt{2})\;+\;(2+\sqrt{2})\,q\;+\;(2+\sqrt{2})\,q^{2}+O(q^{3}).
\]

• Candidate 2  
\[
\frac{(q^{2};q^{2})_\infty+\sqrt{2}(q;q^{2})_\infty}{(q;q)_\infty}
      \;=\;\frac1{(q;q^{2})_\infty}\;+\;\frac{\sqrt{2}}{(q^{2};q^{2})_\infty}
      \;=\;(1+q+q^{2}+O(q^{3}))\;+\;\sqrt{2}(1+q^{2}+O(q^{3}))
\]
\[
      =\;(1+\sqrt{2})\;+\;1\,q\;+\;(1+\sqrt{2})\,q^{2}+O(q^{3}).
\]

The coefficients of \(q\) (and of higher powers) differ:  
Candidate 1 has coefficient \(2+\sqrt{2}\) for \(q\), whereas Candidate 2 has coefficient \(1\).

Hence the two expressions are not equivalent.
The two expressions

1. \((-\sqrt{2};q)_\infty = \displaystyle\prod_{n=0}^{\infty}\bigl(1+\sqrt{2}\,q^{\,n}\bigr)\)

2. \(\dfrac{1}{(\sqrt{2}\,q;q)_\infty}= \displaystyle\frac{1}{\prod_{n=0}^{\infty}(1-\sqrt{2}\,q^{\,n+1})}\)

are clearly different products: every factor in the first product is of the form \(1+\sqrt{2}\,q^{n}\), while every factor in the denominator of the second product is \(1-\sqrt{2}\,q^{n+1}\). There is no standard identity equating these two infinite products, nor does one product equal the reciprocal of the other. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 states that  
Gal₃ ≅ SU₄(𝔽₂) ≅ PSp₄(𝔽₃) ≅ W(E₆)/{±1} and has order 25 920.

Candidate 2 states that  
Gal₃ has order 51 840, is PSp₄(𝔽₃):2 (an index-2 extension of PSp₄(𝔽₃)) and is W(E₆)/center.

The two candidates give different orders (25 920 vs 51 840) and different group structures (PSp₄(𝔽₃) vs PSp₄(𝔽₃):2). Because these numerical and structural assertions do not match, the answers are not equivalent (Rules 2 and 4).

The two candidates give entirely different formulas:

Candidate 1:  
Kf(Q'_n(8,4)) = (32 n³ – 2 n)/3 + (36 n² √14 / 7)·( (μⁿ – νⁿ)/((μⁿ + νⁿ) – 2) ).

Candidate 2:  
Kf(Q'_n(8,4)) = n(n² – 1)/(6 μ) + n/ν.

• Candidate 1 contains cubic and quadratic terms in n with a factor √14 and involves μⁿ, νⁿ in both numerator and denominator.  
• Candidate 2 has a simpler rational expression: terms proportional to n³/μ and n/ν with no √14 and no exponentials of n.

There is no algebraic manipulation that can make these two expressions identical for all n, μ, ν. They differ in structure, dependence on variables, and constants.

Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates provide a 3-component list.

Candidate 1: [0.8, 0.0, 0.6]  →  [0.800000, 0.000000, 0.600000]

Candidate 2: [4/5, 0, 3/5]  →  [0.800000, 0.000000, 0.600000]

Each corresponding component matches exactly to six significant digits, and the order is the same. Hence, the two answers are equivalent.

The two answers give the same numerical figure (14 666.67), but:

• Candidate 1 supplies no unit.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly states “IDR 14 666.67 /USD.”

For an exchange-rate question, two orientations are reasonable (IDR per USD or USD per IDR). Because Candidate 1 omits the unit, there is an ambiguity that Rule 1 says makes the answers inequivalent when multiple units could apply.

The exact answer is 
log₂(52! / (26! 26!)) ≈ 48.8490 bits.

Candidate 1 gives 48.8 bits, which corresponds to 48.8000 when written with six significant digits.  
48.8000 and 48.8490 differ at the fourth significant digit, so by Rule 4 the two predictions do not match to six‐digit precision.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers represent numerical values in bits, so compare them.

Candidate 2 gives the exact value  
H = log₂ (52 choose 26).

Compute its numeric magnitude (to check against Candidate 1):

log₂ (52 choose 26) ≈ 48.816 bits  
 (using exact factorial values or Stirling’s approximation).

Candidate 1 states 48.8 bits, i.e. 48.800000 when written to six significant digits.

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 48.800000  
• Candidate 2: 48.8160…  

They differ starting at the third decimal place, so they are not identical to 6 significant digits.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The value of  

log₂ (52! / (26!)²) ≈ 48.818 … bits.  

Candidate 1 gives 48.8 (interpreted as 48.800 000 to six significant digits), whereas the exact expression in Candidate 2 evaluates to 48.818 … bits, differing in the 3rd–4th decimal place.  
Since Rule 4 requires agreement to six significant digits for numerical answers, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same numeric value (3.54 × 10⁻⁷).  
However:

• Candidate 1 omits any unit.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly states the unit “C” (coulombs).

According to Rule 1, if one answer lacks a unit and that omission can cause ambiguity, the answers are considered inequivalent. A charge must be specified with a unit (C, μC, etc.); leaving it unit-less introduces ambiguity.

The numeric value of Candidate 1 is 0.66667.  
Expressed to six significant digits, that is 0.666670.

The value of Candidate 2 is 2/3 = 0.666666…  
Rounded (or truncated) to six significant digits, that is 0.666667.

Since 0.666670 ≠ 0.666667 at the sixth significant digit, the two answers are not the same.

The two candidates give numerical answers:

Candidate 2: 102.94  

Expressed to six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 102.950  
Candidate 2 → 102.940  

Since 102.950 ≠ 102.940 (they differ in the 5th significant digit), the two answers are not identical to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

The question requires three numerical roots.  
Both candidates supply three numbers in the same order, so we compare each corresponding value.

Convert each to 6-significant-digit form (pad with zeros if fewer digits are given):

1. Candidate 1: 53.52 → 53.5200  
   Candidate 2: 53.5295  
   Comparison: 53.5200 ≠ 53.5295 (mismatch at the 4th decimal place).

2. Candidate 1: 54.25 → 54.2500  
   Candidate 2: 54.2575  
   Comparison: 54.2500 ≠ 54.2575 (mismatch).

3. Candidate 1: 54.76 → 54.7600  
   Candidate 2: 54.7600  
   Comparison: identical.

Because at least one of the three corresponding numbers fails to match to 6 significant digits, the two candidate answers are not equivalent (Rules 2, 3, 4).
The question asks for all the roots.  
Both candidates give three roots, but we must compare each numerical value to six significant digits (Rule 4):

1) 53.52 → 53.5200  
   53.5297 → 53.5297  
   They differ at the 4th–5th significant digit.

2) 54.25 → 54.2500  
   54.2576 → 54.2576  
   They differ at the 4th–5th significant digit.

3) 54.76 → 54.7600  
   54.7615 → 54.7615  
   They differ at the 5th significant digit.

Since at least one discrepancy exists for every root at the required six-digit precision, the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

The question expects two pieces of information:

1. An interval containing the smallest positive root.
2. The root itself, correct to two decimal places.

Candidate 1 supplies only a numerical root “1.8” and omits the interval.  
Candidate 2 supplies both the interval “(1, 2)” and the root “1.80”.

Because Candidate 1 fails to give one of the required answers, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates provide a single numerical value for \(y(1)\).  
Candidate 1: 2.0625  
Candidate 2: 2.0625  

Expressed to six significant digits, both are 2.06250.  
Since the values match exactly (Rule 4) and no units or multiple sub-answers complicate the comparison, the two predictions are equivalent.

The question expects a single numerical value (the sum of eigenvalues of the covariance matrix).  

• Candidate 1 gives: 2.767  
• Candidate 2 gives: 4.4375  

They are both pure numbers (same implicit units), so compare them directly.  
According to Rule 4, numbers must match to 6 significant digits to be considered equivalent.  
2.767000 ≠ 4.437500  

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two answers are not equivalent.

Reason:
• Candidate 1 specifies “50.7 atm,” explicitly giving the pressure and its unit.
• Candidate 2 gives only “50.7” without any unit.  
  For a pressure prediction, several units (atm, Pa, bar, etc.) are possible; omitting the unit makes the value ambiguous.

According to Rule 1, if one answer includes the unit and the other omits it in a context where multiple units are plausible, the answers are considered inequivalent.

The question asks for the molar enthalpy change, ΔHₘ, whose proper unit is kJ mol⁻¹.

• Candidate 1: “+3.60 kJ” – unit given is kJ (per mole not specified).  
• Candidate 2: “3.60 kJ/mol” – unit explicitly kJ mol⁻¹.

Because Candidate 1 omits “per mol,” its unit can be interpreted as total kJ, which is ambiguous relative to the required molar quantity. Under Rule 1, omission of a necessary unit when multiple interpretations are possible makes the answers inequivalent.

Candidate 1: “7 mol⁻¹”  
Candidate 2: “7.23 kJ mol⁻¹”

1. Units  
   – Candidate 1 gives “mol⁻¹” with no energy unit (J, kJ, etc.), so the dimensionality is unclear.  
   – Candidate 2 gives “kJ mol⁻¹”.  
   Because Candidate 1 omits the energy unit, the answer is ambiguous per Rule 1; this alone makes the two answers inequivalent.

2. Numerical value  
   Even if one assumed Candidate 1 implicitly meant “kJ mol⁻¹”, the values 7.00000 and 7.23000 differ beyond 6 significant digits, so they would still not match (Rule 4).

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates differ in their treatment of units.

• Candidate 1: “140 atm” – explicitly gives the pressure and states the unit “atm.”  
• Candidate 2: “140” – gives only a number with no unit.

The question presents pressure data in atmospheres but, in principle, an answer could also be given in other common pressure units (Pa, bar, etc.). Because Candidate 2 omits the unit, it is ambiguous which unit is meant. According to Rule 1, if one answer lacks a unit in a context where multiple units are plausible, the omission creates ambiguity, and the answers are not considered equivalent.

Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two answers use the same unit (kJ mol⁻¹) but give different numerical values when compared to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 817.90 kJ mol⁻¹ → 817.900 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 818 kJ mol⁻¹ → 818.000 (to six significant digits)

Since 817.900 ≠ 818.000, the answers are not the same under Rule 4.

Both candidates give the numerical value 3.38.  

• Candidate 1 explicitly states the unit “atm”.  
• Candidate 2 omits the unit, but the question specifically asks for the pressure “in atm”. Since only one unit is appropriate and expected, the omission does not create real ambiguity.

The numerical values match exactly (3.38000 vs. 3.38000 at six significant digits).

Therefore, the two predictions are considered equivalent.

The two candidates give pressures in different units, but after converting Candidate 1’s value to the same unit as Candidate 2 (kPa):

Candidate 1: 0.042 atm = 0.042 × 101.325 kPa ≈ 4.25565 kPa  
Candidate 2: 4.27 kPa (interpreted as 4.27000 kPa to six significant digits)

Comparing to six significant digits, 4.25565 ≠ 4.27000.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers give the pressure in different units:

• Candidate 1: 0.042 atm  
• Candidate 2: 4.27 kPa

Converting Candidate 1 to kPa:  
0.042 atm × 101.325 kPa/atm = 4.25565 kPa.

Now compare (expressed to six significant digits, Rule 4):
• 4.25565 kPa  
• 4.27000 kPa  

They differ at the third significant digit (5 vs 7), so they are not the same to six significant digits.  
Hence, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give numerically identical values (−100 vs. −1.0 × 10²), but  
• Candidate 1 explicitly supplies the unit “J”.  
• Candidate 2 omits any unit.

Because work could reasonably be expressed in more than one unit for this problem (e.g., J or L · atm), the omission of a unit in Candidate 2 creates ambiguity per Rule 1. Hence the answers are not considered equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical estimate (an energy difference) with an implied unit of kJ mol⁻¹.  

Candidate 1: “−21 kJ mol⁻¹”  
• has a unit (kJ mol⁻¹)  
• value is −21  

Candidate 2: “21.6”  
• omits any unit (ambiguous)  
• value is +21.6 (positive)  

Even if we assume Candidate 2 intends kJ mol⁻¹, the sign differs and the magnitudes do not match to six significant digits (−21.0000 vs +21.6000).  
Per Rule 1 (unit omission causes ambiguity) and Rule 4 (numerical comparison), the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates provide numerical answers with different units.

• Candidate 1: 17 kN mol⁻¹ = 1.7 × 10⁴ N mol⁻¹  
  Converting to force per molecule by dividing by Avogadro’s number (6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹) gives  
  ≈ 2.823 × 10⁻²⁰ N per molecule.

• Candidate 2: 2.85 × 10⁻²⁰ N (per molecule).

Even after converting Candidate 1 to the same unit (N per molecule), the values do not coincide to 6 significant digits (2.823 × 10⁻²⁰ vs 2.850 × 10⁻²⁰) as required by Rule 4. Additionally, the original units differ (per mole vs absolute), creating ambiguity under Rule 1.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two answers are not explicitly the same.

• Candidate 1: “8.7 kPa”  → numeric value = 8.7 kPa = 8.7 × 10³ Pa.  
• Candidate 2: “8.7 × 10³” with no unit.  

Because Candidate 2 omits the unit, the number could represent 8.7 × 10³ Pa, 8.7 × 10³ kPa, or another unit; the question allows several reasonable pressure units (Pa, kPa, atm, etc.). Under Rule 1, omission of a necessary unit when multiple units are plausible makes the answer ambiguous, so the two responses are not considered equivalent.

The numerical value given by Candidate 1 is

5654.86677646 ft³.

Candidate 2 gives the expression

1800 π  ≈ 1800 × 3.141592653589793 = 5654.8667764616…

Comparing to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 5654.86…  
• Candidate 2: 5654.86…

They match to well beyond six significant digits.

Both answers describe the pool’s volume; the question context makes cubic feet the implicit unit, so the omission of the unit in Candidate 2 does not introduce ambiguity.

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers represent the same numerical quantity.

• Candidate 1: 5654.86677646 ft³  
• Candidate 2: 1800 π ≈ 1800 × 3.141592653589793 = 5654.86677646 ft³

Comparing to six significant digits:  
5654.86 (Candidate 1) vs. 5654.86 (Candidate 2) → identical.

The question’s only reasonable unit is cubic feet (all pool dimensions are in feet), so the lack of an explicit unit in Candidate 2 does not create ambiguity.

Thus the two predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give the same numerical value: 1110.  

Candidate 1 explicitly writes “1110 cm³”, while Candidate 2 just writes “1110”.  
Because the problem’s data (areas in cm², spacing in cm) make cubic-centimetres the natural and essentially unique unit for the volume, the omission of “cm³” in Candidate 2 does not introduce meaningful ambiguity. Hence both candidates convey the same answer.

• Candidate 2: 1838.5 → 1838.50 (expressed to 6 significant digits)

The question expects a single numerical distance, in meters.

Candidate 1: 209.1 m  
Candidate 2: 209.1 (implicitly meters)

• Numerical values: both 209.1 → match to at least six significant digits (209.100 vs 209.100).  
• Units: only meters make sense here; omission in Candidate 2 is not ambiguous.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

62.8318530718 → 62.8318  
62.8318530717959… → 62.8318

• Candidate 2: 2.20 eV  
  → in J: 2.20 eV × 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV ≈ 3.52479 × 10⁻¹⁹ J

Comparing the numerical values to six significant digits:

• 3.52 × 10⁻¹⁹ J = 3.52000 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
• 3.52479 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  

or, in eV,

• 2.19688 eV  
• 2.20000 eV

They differ at the fourth (and subsequent) significant digits, so they do not match to six significant digits. Hence, under Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the energy as 2 × 10⁻¹⁵ J.  
Candidate 2 gives 12.4 keV.

Convert Candidate 2 to joules:  
1 keV = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁶ J  
12.4 keV = 12.4 × 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁶ J  
      ≈ 1.9867 × 10⁻¹⁵ J.

Now compare the two numerical values in the same unit:

• Candidate 1: 2.00000 × 10⁻¹⁵ J (expressed to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 1.98670 × 10⁻¹⁵ J (to 6 significant digits)

They differ in the significant digits (2.00000 vs 1.98670).  
According to Rule 4, the numbers must match to 6 significant digits to be considered equivalent, and they do not.

Candidate 1 gives the energy as 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷ J per electron.  
Candidate 2 gives the energy as 100 eV.

Converting 100 eV to joules (using 1 eV = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J) gives
100 eV = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁷ J.

Expressing both answers with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.60200 × 10⁻¹⁷ J  
• Candidate 2: 1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁷ J

They differ at the 5th–6th significant digits, so by Rule 4 they are not considered the same.

The two candidates are both numerical expressions for the same single quantity (the geodesic length).  

• Candidate 1 gives the decimal 2.534324263.  
• Candidate 2 gives the exact expression 2√2 sin(π√2 / 4).  
  Evaluating this expression:
  π√2 ≈ 4.442882938158366  
  (π√2)/4 ≈ 1.110720734539591  
  sin(1.110720734539591) ≈ 0.896019…  
  2√2 × 0.896019… ≈ 2.53432444…

Hence Candidate 2 ≈ 2.53432444, which matches Candidate 1 = 2.534324263 to at least six significant digits (both are 2.53432 …).  
No unit issues or multiple-answer issues arise.

Therefore the two predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates express the displacement with compatible units:

• Candidate 1: 2.26 mm = 0.00226 m  
• Candidate 2: 0.0023 m

Expressed to six significant digits:
• 0.00226 m → 2.26000 × 10⁻³ m  
• 0.0023 m  → 2.30000 × 10⁻³ m

Because 2.26000 × 10⁻³ ≠ 2.30000 × 10⁻³ at the 6-significant-digit level, the two answers are not identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers use the same unit once converted (meters):
• Candidate 1: 2.26 mm = 0.002260 m  
• Candidate 2: 0.0023 m

Expressed to six significant digits:
• 0.00226000 m  
• 0.00230000 m

Since 0.00226000 ≠ 0.00230000, the numerical values differ. Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

The two predictions both give a period of

• 9 × 10⁷ years (Candidate 1 writes “9 10⁷ yr”, which is interpreted as 9 × 10⁷ years)  
• 9.0 × 10⁷ years (Candidate 2)

Same units (years) and the numerical values are identical to six significant digits (9.00000 × 10⁷ in both cases). Hence they are equivalent.

The two candidates correspond to different numerical values:

• Candidate 2: 1 + √2 ≈ 2.414213562

Since 5.828427 ≠ 2.414214 to six significant digits, the answers are not the same.

The two candidates give numerical answers with the same unit (m s⁻²), so compare the values to six significant digits:

Candidate 1: 9.78000  
Candidate 2: 9.76500  

Since 9.78000 ≠ 9.76500, the answers are different.

First convert both answers to the same unit.

Candidate 1: 3700 km = 3 700 000 m  
Candidate 2: 3 704 710 m

Express both to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 3.70000 × 10⁶ m  
• Candidate 2: 3.70471 × 10⁶ m

Since 3.70000 × 10⁶ ≠ 3.70471 × 10⁶ at 6 significant digits, the two predictions are not the same value.

The two candidates do not give the same information.

• Candidate 1 only states the general intensity formula  
  I = I₀ (sin β / β)² cos² γ,  
without using the specific ratio d/a = 5 or mentioning how many fringes appear or which orders are missing.

• Candidate 2 does not present the formula at all; instead it interprets the case d/a = 5, saying there are 9 bright fringes in the central envelope and that the 5th-order fringes are missing.

Because the contents are different—one is a general equation, the other is a specific qualitative/quantitative description—the answers are not equivalent.

The question effectively asks for two pieces of information:
1.  The required diameter (or radius) of the telescope’s aperture.
2.  The required focal-length ratio (beam-expander ratio) of the short-focus lens relative to the telescope.

Candidate 1 supplies explicit numerical values for both:
•  Radius ≈ 0.6 m (⇒ diameter ≈ 1.2 m)  
•  F/f ≥ 100  

Candidate 2 gives only:
•  A formula for the diameter, D = 2λ/10⁻⁶ (leaving λ unspecified)  
•  A qualitative statement that F/f must be whatever value is needed to expand the beam to that diameter (no number supplied)

Hence:
•  The aperture statements are not strictly identical: C2 leaves λ unspecified while C1 fixes a number (0.6 m radius) that corresponds only if one assumes λ≈0.6 µm.  
•  The focal-length-ratio statements differ: C1 gives ≥ 100; C2 gives no numeric requirement.

Because at least one required sub-answer (the focal-length ratio) is specified numerically in C1 but not in C2, the two responses are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 8).

The question asks for four sub-answers (a)–(d).  
• Both candidates give the same result for (a) and (c).  
• For (b) Candidate 1 gives Δθ ≈ λ∕(Nd) (with N = 6), while Candidate 2 gives Δθ = λ∕(6d cos θ). These expressions are not identical except at θ = 0, so they disagree.  
• For (d) Candidate 2 provides a qualitative sketch description, whereas Candidate 1 gives no answer.

Because at least one sub-answer differs and Candidate 1 omits part (d), the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

• Candidate 1 supplies four answers, one for each part.  
• Candidate 2 gives only a single formula, which corresponds to part (d) alone and omits answers for parts (a), (b) and (c).

The two candidates give complete sets of Fresnel‐coefficients plus Brewster’s angle, so every sub-result must coincide.

• For s-polarization both give
  – Candidate 1:  r_s = sin(θ₂−θ₁)/sin(θ₂+θ₁)
  – Candidate 2:  r_s = (n₁cosθ₁ − n₂cosθ₂)/(n₁cosθ₁ + n₂cosθ₂)

These are algebraically the same (Snell’s law converts one into the other).

• For p-polarization they differ:
  – Candidate 1:  r_p = tan(θ₂−θ₁)/tan(θ₂+θ₁)
  – Candidate 2:  r_p = (n₂cosθ₁ − n₁cosθ₂)/(n₁cosθ₂ + n₂cosθ₁)

Using Snell’s law these two expressions are not equal; numerical checks (e.g. n₁=1, n₂=1.5, θ₁=30°) give opposite signs and very different magnitudes. Hence the two candidates disagree on r_p, and the associated transmission formulae also cannot both be correct.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical factor, 27/128.  

• Candidate 1 supplies the transmitted intensity explicitly as (27/128) I₀.  
• Candidate 2 supplies the transmitted fraction, 27/128.  

Because the transmitted intensity is simply that fraction of the incident intensity (I = (27/128) I₀), the two answers convey the same information; Candidate 2’s omission of I₀ does not introduce ambiguity in this context. Hence the predictions are equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different quantities.

• Candidate 1: \( \dfrac{27}{128} I_0 \)  (an intensity, explicitly proportional to the incident intensity \(I_0\))  
• Candidate 2: \( \dfrac{27}{128} \)  (a dimensionless number, giving only a fraction)

The question asks for “how much of the intensity … is transmitted.”  An answer can legitimately be expressed either as the transmitted intensity itself (requiring the factor \(I_0\)) or as the fraction of the incident intensity.  Because Candidate 2 omits \(I_0\), it is ambiguous whether it is giving the actual transmitted intensity or merely a ratio.  Under Rule 1, when one answer includes the necessary unit/quantity and the other omits it, causing potential confusion, the two answers are considered inequivalent.

The question has two sub-parts; therefore equivalence must be checked for both.

Sub-part (a):
• Candidate 1 gives  I(θ)=4A² cos²(πa sinθ/λ).  
• Candidate 2 gives  I(θ)=4I₀ cos²(πa sinθ/λ).  

If one identifies A² with I₀, the formulas match, so sub-answers (a) are effectively the same.

Sub-part (b):
• Candidate 1 writes   I(θ) ∼ ρ(a) cos²(πa sinθ/λ).  This simply multiplies cos² by the distribution ρ(a); no averaging over the jitter is performed and no qualitative description of fringe visibility is given.
• Candidate 2 states that, after averaging, the fringe visibility is reduced, yielding a central peak with smeared/washed-out outer fringes.

These two responses are not the same: Candidate 1 provides an expression that is not the averaged intensity pattern described by Candidate 2, and gives no statement about reduced visibility or fringe washing-out.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates supply three expressions corresponding to parts (a), (b), and (c):

Part (a):
 • C1: θ = ± sin⁻¹(λ/a)  
 • C2: θ = sin⁻¹(λ/a)

Part (b):
 • C1: θ = ± sin⁻¹(λ/6d)  
 • C2: θ = sin⁻¹(λ/6d)

Part (c):
 • C1: θ = ± sin⁻¹(λ/2d)  
 • C2: θ = sin⁻¹(λ/2d)

The only difference is that Candidate 1 explicitly includes the negative counterpart (±), while Candidate 2 lists only the positive value. Since the problem merely asks for “the angle θ” and the negative angle is just the symmetric counterpart of the same magnitude, both candidates convey the same essential numerical results; Candidate 1 simply states both possible signs.

Thus the two sets of answers are equivalent.

The question asks for all wavelengths (within 4000–7000 Å) that give maximum reflected‐light intensity, so we must compare each wavelength listed by the two candidates.

Candidate 1: 6000 Å, 4285 Å  
Candidate 2: 6000 Å, 4286 Å

• Both give the wavelength 6000 Å.  
• For the second wavelength, Candidate 1 gives 4285 Å whereas Candidate 2 gives 4286 Å.  
  – Using Rule 4, express each value with six significant digits: 4285 Å → 4285.00 Å, 4286 Å → 4286.00 Å.  
  – These differ at the units place, so they are not identical to six significant digits.

Because at least one of the wavelengths differs, the two answer sets are not identical. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.
Both candidates give explicit numerical/locational answers for part (a), and those answers disagree:

• Candidate 1: zeros at x = ± (1/√3) d  
• Candidate 2: zeros at (0, ± d)

These are different positions (±0.577 d versus ±1 d).  
Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates present the same numerical relationship for the radius:

• Candidate 1: \(a \approx \tfrac{b}{8}\)  
• Candidate 2: \(a = \tfrac{b}{8}\) (no explicit “≈”, but same value)

The problem statement itself asks for an approximate value (“Find, approximately, the minimum radius…”), so omitting the “≈” symbol does not change the substantive answer. Both candidates specify the identical value \(b/8\). Hence they are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give the same numerical expression for the radius:

• Candidate 1:  a ≈ b/8  
• Candidate 2:  b/8

Because the problem explicitly asks for an approximate value (“Find, approximately, the minimum radius …”), writing “≈” versus omitting it does not change the numeric prediction. Both answers state the radius is one-eighth of b. Hence they are equivalent.

• For part (a) the candidates give different conditions:

  – Candidate 1: “same solution when |Eₐ| < |σ₀/(2ε₀)|.”  
  – Candidate 2: “same solution when the applied electric field is zero.”

  These are clearly not the same statement.

• Although both candidates give the same expression and validity range for part (b), the disagreement in part (a) makes the overall sets of answers different (Rule 2).

Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 5 × 10⁻⁸ J (explicitly in joules)  
Candidate 2: 5.0 × 10⁻⁸ (no unit stated)

The question asks for a change in electrostatic energy, for which several units (J, eV, erg, etc.) could reasonably be used. Because Candidate 2 omits the unit, the answer is ambiguous, whereas Candidate 1 specifies joules. According to Rule 1, omission of a necessary unit when multiple units are plausible makes the two answers inequivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a vector current density

with an explicit negative sign (direction along −eₓ).

Candidate 2 gives only a positive scalar magnitude  
J = (4/9) ε₀ √(2 e/m) V₀^{3/2}/d².

Although the magnitudes match, Candidate 2 omits the direction and has the opposite sign compared with Candidate 1. Because current density is a vector quantity and the two answers disagree on its sign/direction, the predictions are not identical.

The question asks for TWO separate “least positive charge” values:
1. when the external charge is +q,
2. when the external charge is –q.

Candidate 1 supplies two distinct formulas (one for each case).  
Candidate 2 gives only a single expression \(qa/r\) and therefore omits one of the required answers.  
Moreover, the single formula in Candidate 2 does not match either of Candidate 1’s formulas.

Hence, according to Rule 2 (multiple‐answer requirement) and the direct mismatch of expressions, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same two pieces of information that the problem asks for (field inside the sphere and field outside the sphere) and the mathematical expressions represent the same fields once one notes that

• Candidate 1 treats ε as the absolute permittivity, so ε = εr ε0.  
• Candidate 2 treats ε as the relative dielectric constant εr (dimensionless).

With that identification:

Inside field  
Candidate 1: 3 ε0 /(ε + 2 ε0) E0 = 3 /(εr + 2) E0 = Candidate 2’s result.

Outside field  
The ratio (ε − ε0)/(ε + 2 ε0) becomes (εr − 1)/(εr + 2), matching Candidate 2’s coefficient.  
The vector factor 3(E0·r)r/r^5 − E0/r^3 used by Candidate 1 equals E0 (2 cosθ r̂ + sinθ θ̂)/r^3 used by Candidate 2 for a background field along ẑ.

Hence, after simple unit/notation conversion, both candidates supply identical electric-field expressions inside and outside the dielectric sphere.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the required “inside” and “outside’’ electric-field formulas, but they use the symbol ε differently.

Candidate 1 treats ε as an absolute permittivity (units of F m⁻¹) and therefore keeps ε₀ explicitly in the ratios:
 E_in = (3 ε₀)/(ε + 2 ε₀) E₀, 
 E_out coefficient = (ε – ε₀)/(ε + 2 ε₀).

Candidate 2 treats ε as the dimensionless dielectric constant (relative permittivity):
 E_in = 3/(ε + 2) E₀, 
 E_out coefficient = (ε – 1)/(ε + 2).

Because the same symbol ε carries different units/meaning in the two answers, the expressions are not the same when ε is interpreted identically in both. This unit/definition mismatch causes ambiguity (Rule 1), so the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates use different definitions for the symbol ε.

• Candidate 1 treats ε as an absolute permittivity and keeps ε0 explicitly, giving factors like 3 ε0 / (ε + 2 ε0) and (ε – ε0)/(ε + 2 ε0).

• Candidate 2 omits ε0 entirely and uses factors such as 3 / (ε + 2) and (ε – 1)/(ε + 2), i.e. it treats ε as a dimension-less relative permittivity (with the vacuum value taken to be 1).

Because the same symbol ε carries different units/meaning in the two answers, the numerical factors in the fields are not the same unless one makes an additional identification (ε → ε/ε0) that is nowhere stated. Under Rule 1 this unit/definition mismatch makes the two answers inequivalent.

      = [(c − v)/(c + v)] ω

Candidate 2: ω₂ = ω [(c − v)/(c + v)]

• Candidate 2: \(x = \dfrac{c^{2}}{g}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-v^{2}/c^{2}}}-1\right)\)

Candidate 2 subtracts 1 inside the brackets; Candidate 1 does not. This difference equals a constant shift of \(c^{2}/g\), so the expressions are not the same (e.g., at \(v=0\), Candidate 1 gives \(x=c^{2}/g\) while Candidate 2 gives \(x=0\)). Hence the answers are inequivalent.

    \( \mathbf{E}_{\text{outside}} = \mathbf{E}+ \dfrac{\varepsilon_1-\varepsilon_2}{\varepsilon_1+2\varepsilon_2} a^{3}\!\left[\dfrac{3(\mathbf{E}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{r})\mathbf{r}}{r^{5}}-\dfrac{\mathbf{E}}{r^{3}}\right]\,(r>a). \)

  – Candidate 2 only states qualitatively that the outside field is a “non-uniform field given by the superposition of \( \mathbf{E} \) and a dipole field” without specifying the required coefficient or explicit spatial dependence.

Because Candidate 2 omits the explicit expression demanded by the question, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 8: missing required component).

The question asks for three separate results: (a) E(r), (b) V(r), and (c) ΔQ.  
Both candidates give expressions for all three parts, so we compare each part:

1. Electric field E(r):  
   Candidate 1: \(E(r)=\dfrac{V_0}{r\ln(r_2/r_1)}\)  
   Candidate 2: \(E(r)=\dfrac{V_0}{r\ln(r_2/r_1)}\)  
   → identical.

2. Potential V(r):  
   Candidate 1: \(V(r)=V_0\,\dfrac{\ln(r_2/r)}{\ln(r_2/r_1)}\)  
   Candidate 2: \(V(r)=V_0\,\dfrac{\ln(r_2/r)}{\ln(r_2/r_1)}\)  
   → identical.

3. Change in charge ΔQ:  
   Candidate 1: \(\Delta Q = Q\,\dfrac{\ln(r/r_1)}{\ln(r_2/r_1)}\)  
   Candidate 2: \(\Delta Q = Q\)  
   → different unless \(\ln(r/r_1)=\ln(r_2/r_1)\), which is not generally true for arbitrary r. Hence the two answers disagree for part (c).

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same formula for the total charge:
q = (π a² B)/R

The order of the factors (π a² B vs. B π a²) does not matter in multiplication; there are no extra or missing factors, signs, or units. Hence the two expressions are mathematically identical.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

• Candidate 1: ϕ = arctan(2/ρ)  
• Candidate 2: ϕ = π + arctan(2/p)

Even if ρ were intended to be the same quantity as p, Candidate 2 has an extra additive term of π. Because arctan(2/ρ) and π + arctan(2/p) differ by π (a non-zero constant) and therefore yield different phase values, the two answers are not the same. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  

F₁ = (Q q r) / (2 π ε₀ R² γ²)  ê_r ,

where q = linear charge density, Q = charge of the single ion, and γ = 1/√(1–v²/c²).

Candidate 2 gives  

F₂ = (q r)/(2 π ε₀ R²) (1 – v²/c²).

Since 1 – v²/c² = 1/γ², F₂ can be rewritten as  

F₂ = (q r)/(2 π ε₀ R² γ²).

Thus F₂ lacks the additional factor Q that appears in F₁.  
Unless Q = 1 by definition (which is not stated), the two expressions are not the same.

Therefore, the two candidates are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single formula for the force, so Rule 2 is satisfied.  
Compare the two expressions:

Candidate 1  
F = (Q q r)/(2 π ε₀ R² γ²) e_r  
  (with γ² = 1/(1–v²/c²))

Candidate 2  
F = (q r)/(2 π ε₀ R²) (1 – v²/c²)

1. Factor (1 – v²/c²) equals 1/γ², so that part matches.
2. Candidate 1 contains an extra factor Q (the charge of the single ion), giving the force proper (units N).  
   Candidate 2 lacks this factor; its units reduce to N / C (electric-field units), not a force.
3. Candidate 1 also explicitly indicates the radial direction vector e_r, which Candidate 2 omits, but the missing Q already makes the results different.

Because the two formulas differ by the multiplicative factor Q (ion charge), they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reason:
• Candidate 1 contains an extra multiplicative factor Q (the charge of the individual ion), giving F ∝ Q q, whereas Candidate 2 gives F ∝ q only.  
• Unless Q were explicitly defined to be 1 (which the question does not state), the two expressions differ by that factor.  
• All other factors (r/(2π ε₀ R²) and (1 – v²/c²)=1/γ²) match, but the missing factor makes the overall results different.

• Candidate 2 is

They differ both in sign and in numerical factor, so they are inequivalent.

The two expressions differ by a numerical factor of π:

• Candidate 2: F = (e² n r)/(2 ε₀ γ²)

Since (1 – v²/c²) = 1/γ², Candidate 2 simplifies to the second expression above, which is larger than Candidate 1 by a factor of π. Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers for all four requested parts (a)–(d).  
Comparing each part:

(a) Electric field: algebraically identical after writing \(q/l\) explicitly.  
(b) Magnetic field: identical because \(\mu_0 = 1/(\varepsilon_0 c^2)\).  
(c) Energy density: identical since \(1/\varepsilon_0 + \mu_0 v^2 = (1+v^2/c^2)/\varepsilon_0\).  
(d) Momentum density: differ.  Candidate 1 has a coefficient proportional to \(v^{\mathbf{2}}\) (\(\propto v^2\)), while Candidate 2 is proportional to \(v^{\mathbf{1}}\) (\(\propto v\)).  Even after using \(\mu_0 = 1/(\varepsilon_0 c^2)\), the extra factor of \(v\) remains.

Because at least one sub-answer is different, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ algebraically:

Candidate 1: C′ = (ε + ε₀)/(2 ε₀) · C = C (1 + ε/ε₀)/2  
Candidate 2: C′ = C (1 + ε)/2

For the same symbol ε these are equal only if ε in Candidate 2 is understood to be the dimensionless relative permittivity ε/ε₀, whereas Candidate 1 treats ε as an absolute permittivity (same units as ε₀). Because the question gives only one symbol ε (“dielectric constant ε”) and does not distinguish two different quantities, the candidates use the same symbol to denote quantities of different dimensions. Hence their formulas yield different numerical results in general.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers to the three requested items, but they disagree on the functional form of the induced electric field in part (b).

• Candidate 1:  
 E_ind (inside) = −(μ₀/3) Ṁ r sinθ φ̂, E_ind (outside) = −(μ₀/3) Ṁ (R³/r²) sinθ φ̂.  
 (r-dependence: linear inside, ∝ 1/r² outside)

• Candidate 2:  
 E_ind = −(μ₀ R/3) Ṁ sinθ φ̂.  
 (r-independent; no separate inside/outside behaviour)

These two expressions are not algebraically the same, so the candidates’ predictions differ for part (b).  
Since all sub-answers must match for equivalence (Rule 2), the overall answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions are

Candidate 1: π + arctan(2 / ρ)

Candidate 2: 3π/2 – arctan(ρ / 2)

For ρ > 0 (which is the usual case in a conductor where ρ represents a positive absorption parameter), one has the identity

arctan(x) + arctan(1/x) = π/2 (for x > 0).

With x = ρ/2, we get

arctan(ρ/2) = π/2 – arctan(2/ρ).

Substituting this into Candidate 2 gives

3π/2 – [π/2 – arctan(2/ρ)] = π + arctan(2/ρ),

which is exactly Candidate 1. Thus the two candidates predict the same phase shift (they differ at most by integer multiples of 2π when ρ takes other signs, which does not change the physical phase).

Therefore the answers are equivalent.

The question has two sub-parts, so both candidates must match in each part.

Sub-answer (a):
• Candidate 1:  3 Q² / 5 R  
• Candidate 2:  3 Q² / (20 π ε₀ R)

These differ by the factor 1/(4 π ε₀).  Candidate 1 has omitted this factor without stating a different unit system, so the two expressions are not unambiguously the same.

Sub-answer (b):
• Candidate 1: 3.88 fm  → 3.88000 to 6 sig. digits  
• Candidate 2: 3.9 fm   → 3.90000 to 6 sig. digits  

3.88000 ≠ 3.90000 at six significant digits, so they disagree.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question is multiple-choice with options  
(a) 1 GeV, (b) 1 MeV, (c) 1 keV.

• Candidate 1 selects “1 MeV.”  
• Candidate 2 selects “(b) 1 MeV.”

Both pick exactly the same option/value (option b, 1 MeV). Therefore, their predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for two separate things:
1. The required muon energy.
2. A Yes/No judgement on whether Earth’s magnetic field is strong enough.

• Energy:
  – Candidate 1: 6.7 × 10^6 MeV  
  – Candidate 2: 6.7 TeV  
  Since 1 TeV = 10^6 MeV, 6.7 × 10^6 MeV = 6.7 TeV, so the energies are equivalent.

• Magnetic-field sufficiency:
  – Candidate 1: supplies a numerical field value (3.49 × 10^-3 T ≈ 35 G), without explicitly saying “Yes” or “No.”
  – Candidate 2: explicitly answers “No.”

The second sub-answer from Candidate 1 is a number, not a Yes/No statement as required, thus it does not match Candidate 2’s explicit “No.” Per Rule 2 (multiple required answers) and Rule 6 (type mismatch: number vs Yes/No), the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: “10^{-5} eV”  
Candidate 2: “10^{-5”

The question’s answers are expressed in electron-volts (eV).  
Candidate 1 includes the correct unit.  
Candidate 2 gives only the bare number “10^{-5” (no unit, and even missing a closing brace), so the required unit is omitted and the value is ambiguous.

By Rule 1, differing or absent units that create ambiguity render the answers inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question offers four numerical choices, each explicitly expressed in eV:

10^{-7} eV, 10^{-5} eV, 10^{-3} eV, 10^{-1} eV.

Candidate 1 selects “10^{-5} eV.”  
Candidate 2 writes “10^{-5}.”

Although Candidate 2 omits the unit, the only admissible unit in the list of options is eV, so the omission does not introduce any real ambiguity: it unmistakably refers to the same option “10^{-5} eV.”  
Therefore both candidates are choosing the identical multiple-choice option.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same numerical value, 10⁻⁵.  
• Candidate 1: “10^{-5} eV” (unit explicitly stated).  
• Candidate 2: “10^{-5}” (unit omitted).

The question’s context makes eV the only reasonable unit; omitting it does not introduce ambiguity. Therefore the two predictions represent the same quantity.

Both candidates give the same two equations

(a) mvr = nℏ  (L = nh/2π)  
(b) 2πr = nλ

so their stated formulas coincide.  
However, part (b) of the question explicitly asks to “state and derive this relationship.”  
Candidate 2 indicates a derivation (“derivation as shown”), whereas Candidate 1 merely states the equation with no derivation at all.  
Because Candidate 1 omits a required component that Candidate 2 supplies, the two answers are not equally complete.

Both expressions can be rewritten in the same factored form:

Candidate 1  
ν = (Δ c² / h) (1 + Δ / (2 M))

Candidate 2  
ν = Δ c² (2 M + Δ) / (2 M h)
  = (Δ c² / h) [(2 M + Δ) / (2 M)]
  = (Δ c² / h) [1 + Δ / (2 M)]

Since (2 M + Δ)/(2 M) = 1 + Δ/(2 M), the two candidates give exactly the same formula (with identical units).

Expressed with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.19000 × 10⁷ s⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 1.20000 × 10⁷ s⁻¹  

Since 1.19000 × 10⁷ ≠ 1.20000 × 10⁷ at six significant digits, the answers are not identical.

The question has two required parts.

Part (a): Both candidates give exactly the same four transformation rules:
• P : p → –p, s → s  
• T : p → –p, s → –s  
Hence they agree here.

Part (b):  
• Candidate 1 only states: “Time-reversal violation is indicated if N(↑) ≠ N(↓).” No axis or correlation is specified, and no experimental requirements are listed.  
• Candidate 2: “Measure nucleon polarization perpendicular to the Λ-spin / nucleon-momentum plane” and then itemizes crucial experimental details.

These proposals are not identical: candidate 2 refers to a specific T-odd perpendicular polarization component and mentions necessary experimental conditions, while candidate 1 just notes an unspecified spin-up / spin-down asymmetry. Because the answers to sub-problem (b) differ, the overall responses are not the same (Rule 2).

Candidate 2 gives 1918.04 GeV.

Expressed to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1920.00 GeV  
• Candidate 2: 1918.04 GeV

The values differ (1920.00 ≠ 1918.04), so the two predictions are not the same.

The question asks for two numerical answers.  
Both candidates give answers for parts (a) and (b), so compare each corresponding pair:

1. Part (a):  
   Candidate 1: 2.6 × 10⁻¹³ s  
   Candidate 2: 2.6 × 10⁻¹³ s  
   → identical.

2. Part (b):  
   Candidate 1: 6.29 × 10⁻² cm = 6.29 × 10⁻⁴ m  
   Candidate 2: 6.3 × 10⁻⁴ m = 6.30 × 10⁻⁴ m  

   Expressed with the same exponent and six significant digits:  
   • Candidate 1: 6.29000 × 10⁻⁴ m  
   • Candidate 2: 6.30000 × 10⁻⁴ m  

   They differ at the second significant digit, so they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for TWO distinct results:
(a) an expression for the scattered wavelength λ′,
(b) an expression for the electron’s kinetic energy T.

Candidate 1 supplies:
1. λ′ = λ + (h/mc)(1 − cos θ)
2. T = [ (1 − cos θ) hc/λ ] / [ 1 − cos θ + (mc λ)/h ]

Thus it answers both sub-problems.

Candidate 2 supplies only a single formula:
h²(1 − cos θ)/(m_e λ λ′).

It neither gives λ′ explicitly nor separately states the kinetic energy. Hence it fails to provide the required two answers.

By Rule 2 (all requested sub-answers must be present), the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both need to supply three numerical (or otherwise definite) ratios.

• Candidate 1  
  – Ratio 1: incomplete/unspecified (just the fraction written, no value)  
  – Ratio 2: “≪ 1” (a qualitative statement)  
  – Ratio 3: “0”

• Candidate 2  
  – Ratio 1: 1  
  – Ratio 2: 0  
  – Ratio 3: 1

Candidate 1 omits a definite value for the first ratio and gives only an inequality for the second. Candidate 2 supplies concrete numerical values for all three ratios. Thus the two sets of answers are clearly different and incomplete relative to each other.

Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates both write the number 1 × 10⁻⁹, but they are describing different kinds of quantities.

• Candidate 1: “ΔV ≈ 1 × 10⁻⁹.”  Because ΔV is an electric-potential difference, the natural reading is an absolute error expressed in volts (or in whatever unit of potential is being used).  A unit is required but not given, so the answer is ambiguous.

• Candidate 2: “accuracy is approximately 1 × 10⁻⁹, or 0.0000001 % error.”  Here the candidate explicitly states a fractional/percentage error; this quantity is dimensionless.

Thus Candidate 1 gives an (ambiguous) absolute error in potential, while Candidate 2 gives a relative (dimensionless) error.  Since the physical kinds of quantities differ and Candidate 1’s omission of units leaves room for multiple interpretations, the two answers are not guaranteed to represent the same thing.

Both candidates give the energy levels as a constant factor raised to the power 1/(β+1).  

Inside the parentheses:

• Candidate 1: h α (β+1) n E₀^β  
• Candidate 2: 2π α (β+1) ħ n E₀^β

Since Planck’s constant satisfies h = 2π ħ, the two bracketed factors are identical:

h α (β+1) n E₀^β = (2π ħ) α (β+1) n E₀^β

Hence the whole expressions are algebraically the same, and the energy spectra predicted by the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both formulas give  

Candidate 1: Eₙ = [ h α (β+1) n E₀ᵝ ]^{1/(β+1)}  

Candidate 2: Eₙ = [ 2π α ħ (β+1) n E₀ᵝ ]^{1/(β+1)}  

Because ħ = h/(2π), we have 2π ħ = h. Substituting this into Candidate 2 turns its bracket into h α (β+1) n E₀ᵝ, exactly the same bracket as in Candidate 1. The powers (1/(β+1)) are identical. Thus the two expressions are mathematically identical and therefore equivalent.
The two candidates are not provably the same expression.

• Candidate 1 introduces a new symbol “α₀” that the problem statement never defines.  
• Candidate 2 rewrites the answer entirely in terms of the original physical parameters m, ω, ħ, β, α.

Unless one explicitly identifies α₀ with √(m ω / ħ), Candidate 1’s result remains ambiguous, so the two answers cannot be asserted to be identical.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question defines the parameters m, ω, β, α only.  
Candidate 1 introduces an extra symbol α₀ that is never defined in the problem statement or in its own answer, so its expression is ambiguous—its numerical value cannot be fixed without an additional definition.  
Candidate 2 gives a formula solely in terms of the stated parameters (m, ω, β, α). Because of this missing definition, we cannot assert the two expressions are the same. Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates answer all three sub-questions, but the numerical results are not the same.

(a) Zero-point amplitude  
• C1: 4.1 × 10⁻¹⁸ m  
• C2: 5.8 × 10⁻¹⁸ m  
Different numbers ⇒ inequivalent (Rule 4).

(b) Tunnelling probability  
• C1: “≈ 0”  
• C2: e^{–9.34 × 10²⁹}  
Not the identical value/format; even if both mean “essentially zero,” they are not strictly the same answer.

(c) Diffraction effect  
• C1 gives diffraction angles (~10⁻³² rad).  
• C2 gives de Broglie wavelength (~10⁻³² m).  
Different physical quantities ⇒ inequivalent (Rule 1/6).

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two overall responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both answers must supply equivalent results for every sub-part (a)–(d).

Sub-part (a):
• Candidate 1 lists Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1 and omits the required parity change.  
• Candidate 2 lists Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1 and explicitly states the parity change.  
→ Not the same.

Sub-part (b):
• Candidate 1 gives only “Δl = f l, …” (unclear) and no explanation of photon spin/helicity/parity.  
• Candidate 2 supplies a specific interpretation.  
→ Not the same.

Sub-part (c):
• Candidate 1 gives a numerical lifetime 2.2 × 10⁻⁸ s.  
• Candidate 2 gives a symbolic formula τ = 9 c³/(256 a³ ω⁴).  
These are not manifestly identical and cannot be shown equivalent without additional information.

Sub-part (d):
• Candidate 1: Γ = 3.0 × 10⁻⁸ eV (numerical).  
• Candidate 2: Γ = 256 ħ a³ ω⁴/(9 c³) (symbolic).  
Again, not the same expression/value.

Since there are discrepancies in several required answers, the two candidates are not equivalent according to Rules 2, 6, and 8.

Both candidates supply:

(a) The same general energy formula for the symmetric top  
 E = (ħ²/2I) J(J+1) + (ħ²/2)(1/I₃ – 1/I) K² (candidate 2)  
 E = (ħ²/2I) J(J+1) + (ħ²/2)(1/I₃ – 1/I) m² (candidate 1)  
(K and m are the same quantum number.)

(b) J = 0: energy 0 in both answers.

 For J = 1, K = 0: both give ħ²/I.

 For J = 1, K = ±1:  

 • candidate 2: ħ²/I + (ħ²/2)(1/I₃ – 1/I) ± (A ħ²)/(4 I²)  
   = ħ²/(2I) + ħ²/(2I₃) ± (A ħ²)/(4 I²)

 • candidate 1: ħ²/(2I) + ħ²/(2I₀) ± (Δ ħ²)/(4 I²)

With the evidently intended identifications I₀ = I₃ and Δ = A (the parameters introduced in the question), the two expressions coincide term-by-term. No additional levels are missing or added.

Hence every sub-answer given by candidate 1 matches the corresponding sub-answer of candidate 2; the two sets of predictions are the same.

The two expressions differ by the factor \(4\pi\varepsilon_{0}\).  
In Gaussian (cgs–esu) units one writes the Coulomb energy with \(e^{2}/r\), whereas in SI one writes \(e^{2}/(4\pi\varepsilon_{0}r)\).  Hence

e\(^{2}_{\text{(cgs)}} = \dfrac{e^{2}_{\text{(SI)}}}{4\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\).

Converting Candidate 1 to SI units therefore gives

\[
\Delta E
= \frac{2\,e^{2}_{\text{(cgs)}} R^{2}}{3 a_{0}^{3}}
= \frac{2\,[e^{2}_{\text{(SI)}}/(4\pi\varepsilon_{0})]\,R^{2}}{3 a_{0}^{3}}
= \frac{e^{2}_{\text{(SI)}} R^{2}}{6\pi\varepsilon_{0} a_{0}^{3}},
\]

which is exactly Candidate 2’s result.

Thus, once unit conventions are taken into account, both candidates give the same physical answer.

The question contains four sub-parts (a)–(d).  
For two candidates to be equivalent, every sub-answer must coincide (Rule 2).

(a) Boundary conditions  
• Candidate 1: continuity of ψ and derivative jump 2Ωψ.  
• Candidate 2: continuity of ψ and derivative jump (2mV₀b/ħ²)ψ.  
They coincide only if Ω = mV₀b/ħ², which is not stated by candidate 1.  
So even part (a) is ambiguous.

(b) Transcendental equation for k₀  
• Candidate 1: cos ka + (Ω/k) sin ka = cos Ka  
• Candidate 2: cos (qa) + (mV₀b/ħ²q) sin (qa) = 1  
Right-hand sides differ: candidate 1 leaves cos Ka, candidate 2 fixes it to 1 (K = 0) as required for the lowest propagating energy. Therefore the two equations are not the same.

Since there is already a clear disagreement in sub-answer (b), the two entire answer sets are not equivalent (Rule 2).

• E = –A ħ² degeneracy = 5  
• E = –3 A ħ² degeneracy = 3

The numerical values, units, and associated degeneracies all match; there are no missing or extra levels. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The question requires two separate numerical results:  

(a) the two Clebsch–Gordan coefficients;  
(b) two sets of three cross-section ratios (for the Δ, I = 3/2 resonance and for the N* I = 1/2 resonance).

Comparison of the candidates:

(a) Both candidates list the same two numerical coefficients {√(2/3), √(1/3)} (candidate 1 associates them with the correct (m₁,m₂) pairs, candidate 2 just lists the numbers). So part (a) is consistent.

(b) Δ (I = 3/2) ratios  
 • Candidate 1: 1 : 1/9 : 2/9  → after clearing denominators 9 : 1 : 2  
 • Candidate 2: 3 : 1 : 2  

 The two triplets 9:1:2 and 3:1:2 are not proportional to each other (there is no common multiplicative factor that turns one into the other). Hence they disagree.

 N* (I = 1/2) ratios  
 • Candidate 1: 0 : 4/9 : 2/9 → proportional to 0 : 2 : 1  
 • Candidate 2: 0 : 2 : 1  
 These coincide, but the disagreement in the Δ case already makes the overall answers different.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give two sub-answers, one for part (a) and one for part (b).  
• Part (a): After simplifying, both formulas are identical:  
  (m B a / (ħ² k sin(θ/2)))² sin²(2ka sin(θ/2)). → equivalent.  
• Part (b):  

  – Candidate 1: ( a / (1 + 2mBa/ħ²) )².  
  – Candidate 2: ( 2mB a² / (ħ² + 2mB a) )² = ( (2mBa/ħ²) a / (1 + 2mBa/ħ²) )².  

  These differ by the extra factor (2mBa/ħ²)² in the numerator, so they are not algebraically equal in general.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ by the factor  

(4 π ε₀)⁻² = 1 / (16 π² ε₀²).

Candidate 2 has the extra denominator 16 π² ε₀² compared with Candidate 1.  
This reflects a change of unit system (Gaussian vs. SI).  
Because the problem statement does not specify which system to use, the omission or inclusion of the (4 π ε₀) factor introduces an unavoidable ambiguity in the numerical value and the units of the answer.

Hence, under the comparison rules, the two candidates are not considered equivalent.
Both answers give the same functional dependence  
 (dσ/dΩ)|θ=0 ∝ (m e A/ℏ²)²  

Candidate 1 is written in Gaussian (cgs) electrostatic units, where the Coulomb constant is 1, so no explicit ε₀ or π appears:

 C1 = A² m² e² / (9 ℏ⁴)

To translate this to SI units, each power of the charge-interaction brings in the factor 1/(4π ε₀).  Since the cross section involves the potential squared, we multiply C1 by (1/(4π ε₀))² = 1/(16 π² ε₀²):

 C1(SI) = A² m² e² / (9 ℏ⁴) × 1/(16 π² ε₀²)  
     = A² m² e² / (144 π² ε₀² ℏ⁴)

Candidate 2 is already expressed in SI units:

 C2 = (m e A / (12 π ε₀ ℏ²))²  
    = A² m² e² / (144 π² ε₀² ℏ⁴)

Thus C1(SI) = C2.  The two candidates are the same result written in different unit conventions.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers give the same symbolic dependence
 m² e² A² / (9 ħ⁴)

The only apparent difference is that Candidate 2 keeps the SI-unit factor ε₀ explicitly,

 m² e² A² / (144 π² ε₀² ħ⁴),

while Candidate 1 is written in Gaussian / natural units where 1/(4π ε₀)=1.  Using the identity
 ε₀ = 1/(4π) (Gaussian units)  ⇒  1/ε₀² = 16 π²,
Candidate 2 becomes

 m² e² A² · 16 π² /(144 π² ħ⁴) = m² e² A² /(9 ħ⁴),

exactly the same as Candidate 1.  Hence, after unit conversion the two expressions are identical.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical probability “≈ 16 %” (i.e. 0.160000).  
Candidate 2 gives the exact expression “erfc(1)”, whose numerical value is ≈ 0.157299.

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 0.160000  
• Candidate 2: 0.157299  

Since 0.160000 ≠ 0.157299 at six-digit precision, the two answers are not equal. They therefore are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas.

• Candidate 1 provides a fully-specified expression containing the width parameter a, extra time-dependence factors, and an exponential that depends on t in a non-trivial way.

• Candidate 2 gives a much more general expression j(t)= (mL / t²) |φ(mL / t)|², written in terms of the momentum-space wavefunction φ; it does not reduce to Candidate 1 unless one inserts a particular choice of φ and, even for a Gaussian φ, the resulting expression does not match the detailed t-dependence of Candidate 1.

Because the two formulas are not the same object and are not algebraically equivalent, the answers are inequivalent.

Both candidates give the same angle-dependent factor, exp(−a²q²/2).  
Candidate 1 multiplies this by m²A²a⁶π/(4ħ⁴), which is just an overall constant with no θ (or q) dependence.  
Since the problem explicitly asks only for the result “up to a multiplicative constant,” any difference consisting solely of an overall constant factor is irrelevant. Hence the two answers convey the same required information.



Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same θ–dependence:

•  Candidate 1: σ(θ) ∝ e^{-q²a²/2}.  With q = 2k sin(θ/2) this is e^{-2a²k² sin²(θ/2)}.

•  Candidate 2: σ(θ) ∝ e^{-2a²k² sin²(θ/2)} directly.

The only difference is an overall multiplicative constant, which the problem statement allows to be ignored (“up to a multiplicative constant”). Hence the two answers are equivalent for the purpose of the question.

Candidate 2 supplies two required results:  
1. Flux quantization Φ = (n + ½) hc/e  
2. k-space area S = (n + ½) 4π²eB/(hc)

Candidate 1 gives only one result:  
S = 2πBe(n + ½)/(ħc) = (n + ½) 4π²eB/(hc), which matches Candidate 2’s S expression after using ħ = h/2π, but Candidate 1 omits the flux quantization formula entirely.  

Because the question asks for both the flux quantization and the k-space area condition, and Candidate 1 provides only one of them, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question has three sub-parts.  
For equivalence, every sub-answer must match.

(a) Eigenfunctions  
• C1:  ψ(θ)=1/√(2π) e^{ikθ}.  
• C2:  ψₙ(φ)=1/√(2π) e^{inφ}, n=0,±1,…  
Same functional form; C2 just states n∈ℤ explicitly. No contradiction → can be regarded as equivalent.

(b) Ground-state occupancies  
• C1:  “0² 1⁴ 2⁴ 3⁴ 4⁴” ⇒ 2 electrons in n=0, 4 in each of n=±1,±2,±3,±4.  
• C2:  “n=0: 2; n=±1,±2,±3,±4: 4 each.”  
These are identical.

(c) Lowest excitation energy and wavelength  
Energy:  
• C1:  ΔE = 9ħ²/(2mr²).  Numerically this equals 2.143 eV.  
• C2:  2.14 eV.  
6-significant-digit comparison: 2.14300 vs 2.14000 → differ.

Wavelength:  
• C1:  λ = 5800 Å = 580 nm.  
• C2:  579 nm.  
6-significant-digit comparison: 5.80000×10² nm vs 5.79000×10² nm → differ.

Since the answers to part (c) are not the same, the two candidates are not equivalent overall.
Both candidates give equivalent answers for parts (a) and (b), and they give the same excitation energy in part (c) (Candidate 1’s formula equals 2.14 eV, the value stated by Candidate 2).

However, for the wavelength they differ:
• Candidate 1: 5800 Å = 580 nm = 5.80000 × 10⁻⁷ m  
• Candidate 2: 579 nm = 5790 Å = 5.79000 × 10⁻⁷ m  

Using Rule 4, numerical answers must match to 6 significant digits. 5.80000 × 10⁻⁷ m and 5.79000 × 10⁻⁷ m differ at the second significant digit, so they are not identical.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ only in the mass symbol:

• Candidate 1: −(27 π² g⁸ m³)/(128 ħ⁶)  
• Candidate 2: −(27 π² g⁸ μ³)/(128 ħ⁶)

The problem statement introduces only one particle, whose mass would conventionally be denoted by “m”.  Candidate 2 instead uses “μ”, a symbol that in standard physics notation normally denotes the reduced mass, which need not equal the particle’s mass.  Because the question provides no definition of “μ”, the substitution m ↔ μ is ambiguous.  According to Rule 1, when such ambiguity arises the answers are to be treated as inequivalent.

Hence the two candidates are not guaranteed to represent the same quantity.

Both candidates express ρ(η) in different but algebraically equivalent forms.

Let k = a⁴.

Candidate 1:
ρ² = [k e^{2η}] / [ (16 – 2k) + 2k e^{2η} ].

Candidate 2:
ρ = a² / √[ 2k + (16 – 2k) e^{-2η}]
⇒ ρ² = k / [ 2k + (16 – 2k) e^{-2η}]
Multiply numerator & denominator by e^{2η}:
ρ² = k e^{2η} / [ 2k e^{2η} + (16 – 2k) ].

Denominators are identical after re-ordering:
(16 – 2k) + 2k e^{2η} = 2k e^{2η} + (16 – 2k).

Thus ρ² (and hence ρ with the positive root) is the same in both candidates, and both satisfy the initial condition.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

Candidate 1:  I = −(2/9) G − (π/6) ln 2  
Candidate 2:  I = −(2/3) G

Subtracting them yields  
[(−2/9) G − (π/6) ln 2] − [−(2/3) G] = (4/9) G − (π/6) ln 2,

which is generally non-zero because (4/9) G ≠ (π/6) ln 2.  
Hence the two answers are not equal.

The two candidates give fundamentally different mathematical expressions for the Fourier transform.

• Candidate 1: \(2\,i\,\dfrac{e^{-i b\sqrt{a^{2}+k^{2}}}}{\sqrt{a^{2}+k^{2}}}\)

• Candidate 2: \(2\pi\,J_{0}\!\bigl(b\sqrt{a^{2}+k^{2}}\bigr)\)

The functions \(e^{-iz}/z\) and \(J_{0}(z)\) are not equal (they even have different asymptotic behaviours and analytic properties). Multiplicative constants (2 i  vs 2 π) also differ. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions for \(I\).

• Candidate 1: \( \pi\bigl(c-\sqrt{c^{2}-a^{2}}\bigr)\)

• Candidate 2: \( \pi a \)

For positive real numbers with \(c>a>0\), \(c-\sqrt{c^{2}-a^{2}}\) is not identically equal to \(a\); indeed it is always smaller than \(a\) unless \(a=0\) (which is excluded). Hence the two answers are not algebraically the same.

Candidate 1 gives a single explicit constant  
 C₁ = π·(25 choose 4)/2²⁴.

Candidate 2 gives a family of constants that still depend on the free integer n:  
 C₂(n) = π·(2n choose n)/2²ⁿ.

Because n is not specified, C₂ can take infinitely many different values.  
No integer n makes (2n choose n)/2²ⁿ equal to (25 choose 4)/2²⁴ (e.g., (25 choose 4)=12 650, whereas (2n choose n) is ≥70 and ≠12 650 for any integer n yielding the same power 2²ⁿ=2²⁴). Therefore the two expressions are not the same constant, and Candidate 2 does not even supply a definite numerical value.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives a single, fully-specified constant:  
 π·C(25, 4) / 2²⁴.

Candidate 2 leaves the result in terms of a free integer parameter n:  
 π·C(2n, n) / 2²ⁿ.

Because Candidate 2’s expression changes with n while Candidate 1’s value is fixed (and there is no n specified that makes the two expressions identically the same), the two answers are not the same quantity. Hence they are not equivalent.

The ratio  
\[
\frac{1+e^{x}}{\,2+e^{x}\,}
\]  
is positive for every real \(x\) (both numerator and denominator are \(>0\)).  
Hence  
\[
\ln\!\left|\frac{1+e^{x}}{2+e^{x}}\right| = \ln\!\left(\frac{1+e^{x}}{2+e^{x}}\right)+C_0,
\]  
where \(C_0\) is at most a different constant of integration.

Therefore the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by an additive constant, meaning they represent the same family of primitives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the antiderivative

ln((1+e^x)/(2+e^x)) + C

Candidate 1 includes an absolute-value sign inside the logarithm, but the quantity (1+e^x)/(2+e^x) is always positive because e^x > 0 for all real x. Hence |(1+e^x)/(2+e^x)| = (1+e^x)/(2+e^x), so the two expressions differ only by an inessential notation choice. Up to the common arbitrary constant C, the antiderivatives are identical.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each give two results (integral value and limit).  

• Limit: both write the same infinite-product ratio, just with or without the Pochhammer notation, so this part matches.  

• Integral:  

 Candidate 1:  
  Iₙ(a)= (π/ sin πs) · [(q^{1-s};q)ₙ / (q;q)ₙ] · [(a;q)ₙ /(a q^{-s};q)ₙ].

 Candidate 2:  
  Iₙ(a)= (π/ sin πs) · (a;q)ₙ / (q^{s};q)ₙ.

The q-dependent prefactor of Candidate 1, (q^{1-s};q)ₙ /(q;q)ₙ, is not equal to 1/(q^{s};q)ₙ (which is what would be required for equivalence with Candidate 2). For n=1, for example, Candidate 1 gives (1−q^{1-s})/(1−q) whereas Candidate 2 needs 1/(1−q^{s}); they are not equal in general.  

Thus the two candidates disagree on the closed-form expression for Iₙ(a), so the answers are not equivalent overall.

Candidate 1’s expression explicitly contains non-zero imaginary terms such as “i π³” and “i π(…)”, so its value is (in general) complex.  
Candidate 2 gives a purely real value, \(\frac{7}{16}\zeta(3)-\frac{\pi^{2}}{12}\ln 2\).

Because a real number and a complex number with non-zero imaginary part cannot be equal, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same antiderivative: the inverse-sine (arcsin) of \(a^x\) divided by \(\ln a\), plus an arbitrary constant.  
“\(\sin^{-1}\)” and “\(\arcsin\)” denote the same inverse-sine function, so the two expressions are mathematically identical.

The two expressions are

Candidate 1: (1/(1-σ)) [(W/γ(I))^{1-σ} – (R/η(I))^{1-σ}]

Candidate 2: (η(I)^σ R^{-1} – γ(I)^σ W^{-1}) / (σ-1)

Note that 1/(σ-1) = -1/(1-σ), so Candidate 2 equals (1/(1-σ)) [γ(I)^σ W^{-1} – η(I)^σ R^{-1}].

Thus the two will coincide only if

(W/γ)^{1-σ} – (R/η)^{1-σ} = γ^σ W^{-1} – η^σ R^{-1}.

Rewrite the left side:

(W/γ)^{1-σ} = W^{1-σ} γ^{σ-1}, (R/η)^{1-σ} = R^{1-σ} η^{σ-1}.

Compare to the right side terms γ^σ W^{-1} and η^σ R^{-1}. In general

W^{1-σ} γ^{σ-1} ≠ γ^σ W^{-1}, and R^{1-σ} η^{σ-1} ≠ η^σ R^{-1}

except for special parameter choices. Therefore the two overall expressions are not algebraically identical for general values of R, W, η(I), γ(I), σ.

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical coefficients in front of the same four integrals.

• Candidate 1 coefficients:  
 A = 32/45 ≈ 0.71111  
 B = (16/45) π² ≈ (16/45)·9.8696 ≈ 3.513  
 C = –(32/45) π ≈ –2.236 π ≈ –7.024  
 D = 16/45 ≈ 0.35556  

• Candidate 2 coefficients (after distributing 960/π²):  
 A = 960/π² ≈ 97.3  
 B = 2880/π² ≈ 291.9  
 C = –3840/π² ≈ –389.2  
 D = 960/π² ≈ 97.3  

These sets of constants are clearly not equal; hence the two expressions for ζ(4) are not the same.

The problem requires TWO distinct results:
1. Moment of inertia of one cylinder.
2. Moment of inertia of the entire composite system.

Candidate 1 supplies both:
• single cylinder: \(I = \frac{M a^{2}}{3}\)  
• composite system: \(I = \frac{11 M a^{2}}{16}\)

Candidate 2 supplies only one value:
• \(\frac{11}{16} M a^{2}\)

Because Candidate 2 omits the required first answer, the two submissions are not equivalent under Rule 2 (incomplete number of answers).

The two expressions are clearly different:

• Coefficient of ζ(5):  
 Candidate 1 gives + 3/5 ζ(5); Candidate 2 gives − 48 ζ(5).

Since ζ(5) appears by itself (i.e. it is not multiplied by logs or other constants that could be re-expressed), such a large difference in both sign and magnitude cannot be reconciled through standard identities. Similar mismatches occur for the Li₅(½) and Li₄(½) terms as well.

Hence the two results cannot be the same.

Both candidates state that the value of the integral equals the n-th derivative of the Gamma function evaluated at a:  

• Candidate 1:  \(I = \dfrac{\partial^{\,n}}{\partial a^{n}}\Gamma(a)\)  
• Candidate 2:  \(\boxed{\Gamma^{(n)}(a)}\)

The notation \(\Gamma^{(n)}(a)\) is standard for the n-th derivative of \(\Gamma\) at a, identical to \(\dfrac{\partial^{\,n}}{\partial a^{n}}\Gamma(a)\).

Hence the two answers are mathematically identical and therefore equivalent.

The two candidates give different closed-form expressions for the same integral.

Candidate 1: I = (a+1)/(2a) · β(1 − a, 1 + 2a) · Hₐ  
Candidate 2: I = β(a + 1, a + 1) · Hₐ

After canceling the common factor Hₐ, the remaining coefficients are

C₁ = (a+1)/(2a) · β(1 − a, 1 + 2a)  
C₂ = β(a + 1, a + 1).

Using the definition β(x,y)=Γ(x)Γ(y)/Γ(x+y), one finds

C₁ = (a+1)/(2a) · Γ(1−a)Γ(1+2a)/Γ(2+a),  
C₂ = Γ(a+1)²/Γ(2a+2).

These two gamma-ratio expressions are not algebraically identical, and a numerical check (e.g., a = ½) gives C₁ = 2 whereas C₂ ≈ 0.3927, confirming the inequivalence.

Hence Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ by powers of r in several places.

1. First term  
   • Candidate 1: (x_i x_j / r²) φ(r)  
   • Candidate 2: (x_i x_j / r⁴) φ(r)  
   → Candidate 2 has an extra factor 1/r².

2. Second term inside brackets  
   • Candidate 1: (δ_{ij} – 3 x_i x_j / r²)  
   • Candidate 2: (δ_{ij}/r – 3 x_i x_j / r³)  
   → Candidate 2 introduces an additional 1/r in both pieces compared with Candidate 1.

Because these differing powers of r cannot cancel with anything else in the formulas, the two tensors are not the same.

Both expressions are algebraic rearrangements of the same identity.

Starting from Candidate 2:
   widehat{(∂^k_j f)}(ν) = (i ν_j)^k  hat{f}(ν)

Since ν_j ≠ 0, divide by (i ν_j)^k:
   hat{f}(ν) = (1/(i ν_j)^k) widehat{(∂^k_j f)}(ν) = (1/(i ν_j))^k widehat{(∂^k_j f)}(ν)

This exactly matches Candidate 1. Hence the two candidates give equivalent answers.

The two candidates give different closed-form expressions for the integral.  
After using the duplication and reflection formulas for the trigamma function, Candidate 1 can be rewritten as  

I₁ = (1/√3)[ψ₁(1/3)/(2π) − π/3].

Candidate 2 is  

I₂ = (√3/18)[ψ₁(1/3) − ψ₁(2/3)]  
  = (√3/9) ψ₁(1/3) − (2π²√3)/27.

Dividing each by √3 gives  

I₁/√3 = ψ₁(1/3)/(2π) − π/3,  
I₂/√3 = ψ₁(1/3)/9 − 2π²/27,

which are plainly not the same function of ψ₁(1/3) and π.  
Numerical evaluation (using ψ₁(1/3)≈10.0953) yields

I₁ ≈ 0.559·√3 ≈ 0.968,  
I₂ ≈ 0.391·√3 ≈ 0.678,

confirming the inequivalence.

Therefore, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s expression contains two parts:

1.  π e^{−αβ} / (2 β cos(πβ))
2.  an infinite series  ∑_{n=0}^{∞} …

Candidate 2 gives only a single term:

   π e^{−αβ} / (β cos(πβ))

Thus Candidate 2 is twice the first term of Candidate 1 and omits the entire infinite sum. In general the omitted sum is not zero, so the two results are not the same function of α and β.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical expression for the same series S (so Rule 2 is satisfied).  
They are both pure numbers (no unit issues, Rule 1).

1.  Express the summand with partial fractions  
   1/[(3n+1)(5n+2)] = 3/(3n+1) – 5/(5n+2).

   Hence  
   S = 3 ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(3n+1) – 5 ∑_{n=1}^∞ 1/(5n+2).

   Shifting the index and rewriting each harmonic-type sum with digammas gives  
   S = ψ(2/5) – ψ(1/3) – ½.

   Using the recurrence ψ(z+1)=ψ(z)+1/z:
   ψ(7/5)=ψ(2/5)+5/2 and ψ(4/3)=ψ(1/3)+3.  
   Substituting, one finds
   S = ψ(7/5) – ψ(4/3).

   Therefore Candidate 2’s answer is the correct analytic form.

2.  Evaluate Candidate 1 numerically:

   a) π/(2√3)·[1 – √{3(1 – 2/√5)}] ≈ 0.396744  
   b) ¼[√5 ln((3+√5)/2) – 2 – ln(3125/729)] ≈ –0.325883  
   Sum ≈ 0.070861.

3.  Evaluate Candidate 2 numerically (using standard digamma values):  
   ψ(7/5) – ψ(4/3) ≈ 0.07086.

   The two numerical values agree to six significant digits (Rule 4).

Hence Candidate 1’s complicated elementary-constant expression equals Candidate 2’s digamma difference. The two answers are equivalent.

Li₃(2) = Li₃(½) − (7/8) ζ(3) − (π²/12) ln 2 + (1/6) ln³2 + (i π/2) ln²2.

Hence

Li₃(2) + i π ln²2 = Li₃(½) − (7/8) ζ(3) − (π²/12) ln 2 + (1/6) ln³2 + (3 i π/2) ln²2,

which clearly differs from Candidate 2 by extra real terms (−(π²/12) ln 2 + (1/6) ln³2) and by an imaginary part ((3 i π/2) ln²2).  Therefore the two expressions are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions.

• Candidate 1:  i π ln²2  + Li₃(2)

 – Li₃(2) (principal value) is a complex number; for x>1 its imaginary part is
  Im Li₃(x) = −π ln²x / 2.  
  Hence Im [Li₃(2)] = −π ln²2 / 2.  
  Adding the extra term i π ln²2 leaves an overall imaginary part of
   i π ln²2 − i π ln²2 / 2 = + i π ln²2 / 2  ≠ 0.  
  So Candidate 1 is complex.

• Candidate 2:  2 Li₃(½)

 – For 0<½<1, Li₃(½) is computed by its convergent power series and is purely real.  
  Therefore Candidate 2 is purely real (≈ 1.074426).

Since one result is complex (non-zero imaginary part) and the other is real, the two expressions cannot be equal. They are therefore inequivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the result  
 I₁ = −2 π e^(−b c) cos(r c).

Candidate 2 gives  
 I₂ = [e^(−c(b−ir)) E₁(−c(b−ir)) − e^(−c(b+ir)) E₁(−c(b+ir))]/(2 i).

These two expressions are very different functions of b, c, r.  
For instance, if we formally set r→0⁺ (keeping b>0), the integrand approaches 0, so the integral should tend to 0.  
• Candidate 2 indeed tends to 0, because the two terms in the numerator become equal.  
• Candidate 1 tends to −2 π e^(−b c) ≠ 0.

Thus the two answers cannot be equal for general allowed parameters. They are not mathematically equivalent.

The two expressions differ by the multiplicative factor in front of

Candidate 2 contributes

Since, in general, \(\Gamma(b)\) is not equal to \(\cos(\pi a)(-1)^{-a}\) for arbitrary independent parameters \(a, b\) (and no such relationship is stated in the problem), the two results are not algebraically identical.

The two expressions differ inside the Heaviside step-function:

• Candidate 2: Θ(|ω| − Δ)

If Δ can be negative (its sign is not fixed, since only Δ² appears in the dispersion), then Θ(|ω| − |Δ|) and Θ(|ω| − Δ) are not the same—for example, at Δ = −1 the second step function is always 1 whereas the first becomes Θ(|ω| − 1). Because the formulas are not identical in all cases, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same overall prefactor but their exponential factors differ:

• Candidate 2: exp[ i(√a – √b)² / T ]  = exp[ i(a + b – 2√ab)/T ]

• Candidate 2  
 \(g(0)= 0 + 2\,\mathrm{erf}(0)=0\).

The two candidates give different closed-form expressions:

Candidate 2: Ω = (π / 2 p q r) · ln[ (q + r)² / (q r) ]

To be equivalent they would need to match for all admissible p, q, r.  
Comparing factors:

1. The prefactors differ: 1/r² versus 1/(p q r).  This already introduces distinct dependencies on p, q, r.

2. The logarithm arguments differ fundamentally: one contains tanh(1/p) (dependence on p inside the log), the other contains only q and r (no p).

There is no algebraic identity that can reconcile these forms for arbitrary parameters. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give very different closed-form expressions for the same integral.

• Candidate 1 contains
  – an explicit e^{-b} term,
  – a series Σ_{m=0}^{∞} involving the upper incomplete gamma Γ(–1–2m, b) (which itself contains factors e^{-b}), and
  – a ₂F₁ with parameters (–m, 3/2; 2; 1 – b²/a²).

• Candidate 2 is simply
  (π/2)·₂F₁(½, ½; 1; a²/b²),
  i.e. no e^{-b}, no incomplete gamma functions, and no series.

There is no general identity that would convert the complicated, b-dependent series with incomplete gamma functions of Candidate 1 into the single hypergeometric term of Candidate 2 for arbitrary positive a < b. Hence the two results cannot be equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give completely different closed–form expressions.

• Candidate 1 expresses I as  
  e^{-b} + ½(b² – a²) ∑_{m=0}^{∞} a^{2m} Γ(−1−2m,b) {}_2F_1(−m, 3/2; 2; 1−b²/a²).

• Candidate 2 gives  
  (π/2) b e^{-b} {}_2F_1(½, ½; 1; a²/b²).

These formulas have different functional dependence on a and b: candidate 1 involves an infinite series of incomplete gamma functions Γ(…, b), whereas candidate 2 contains no incomplete gamma functions at all and has a completely different hypergeometric parameter set. Substituting a simple limiting case (e.g. a→0, b=1) shows the two results evaluate to different numerical values, so they cannot be algebraically identical.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give completely different closed‐form expressions:

Candidate 1:
I = e^{-b} + \frac{1}{2}(b^{2}-a^{2})\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} a^{2m}\,\Gamma(-1-2m,b)\,
        {}_{2}F_{1}\!\left(-m,\frac32;2;1-\frac{b^{2}}{a^{2}}\right).

Candidate 2:
I = \frac{\pi}{2}\, b\;
        {}_{2}F_{1}\!\left(\frac12,\frac12;1;\frac{b^{2}-a^{2}}{b^{2}}\right).

The functional forms, special functions, and overall dependences on a and b are plainly different (series with incomplete gamma vs. single hypergeometric factor; exponential factor e^{-b} present only in Candidate 1, etc.).  There is no evident identity that would make these two expressions coincide, and a quick numerical check (e.g. a = 1, b = 2) shows they give values differing by orders of magnitude.  Therefore the answers are not equivalent.
For each of the three sub-cases, we must compare the two candidates’ individual answers.

(i)  n = m  
 Candidate 1: 1  
 Candidate 2: 1  
 → identical.

(ii) m > n  
 Candidate 1: 0  
 Candidate 2: 0  
 → identical.

(iii) n > m  
 Candidate 1: “the limit does not exist.”  
 Candidate 2: “±∞.”  

“Does not exist” (neither a finite number nor an infinite value) is not the same explicit statement as “±∞” (the limit becomes unbounded, specifically tending to either +∞ or −∞). Because the answers for sub-case (iii) differ, the two sets of answers are not identical.  
By Rule 2, since at least one sub-answer differs, the candidates are not equivalent.

 ≈ 25 – 26 (using standard numerical values).

•  Candidate 2 equals  
 (3/2) π β(4) – π⁵/16  
 ≈ –14.

Candidate 1 gives
 (π / √2) (z/2)^{1/4} e^{−z} [ I_{−1/4}(z) − sgn(ξ) I_{1/4}(z) ].

Candidate 2 gives
 √(π/2) e^{−z} [ I_{−1/4}(z) + I_{1/4}(z) ].

Comparing:

1. Overall multiplicative factor:  
   • Candidate 1: (π/√2)(z/2)^{1/4}  
   • Candidate 2: √(π/2)  
   Their ratio is √π (z/2)^{1/4}, which depends on z, so the factors are not the same.

2. Combination of Bessel functions:  
   • Candidate 1 has I_{−1/4} − sgn(ξ) I_{1/4}.  
   • Candidate 2 has I_{−1/4} + I_{1/4}.  
   These are the same only if sgn(ξ)=−1 and even then the overall factor mismatch remains; for sgn(ξ)=+1 they differ in sign as well.

Since both the multiplicative factors and, in general, the Bessel‐function combinations differ, the two expressions are not equivalent.

Both answers give a single closed-form expression for the same integral, so we only have to compare those two expressions.

Candidate 1  
I₁ = −(15/8) Li₄(½) − (7/4) ζ(3) ln 2 + 467 π⁴/23040 − 5 ln⁴2/64 + 3 π² ln²2/32.

Candidate 2  
I₂ = (1/4) Li₄(½) − 7 π⁴/720 − ln⁴2/48 + π² ln²2/48.

• The explicit coefficients of π⁴, ln⁴2, π² ln²2, Li₄(½), and especially ζ(3) ln 2 are different.  
• No algebraic identity can make I₁ equal to I₂: solving for a hypothetical decomposition of Li₄(½) shows the ζ(3) ln 2 coefficients cannot be reconciled.  
• Therefore the two expressions are not the same.

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different analytic expressions: Candidate 1 includes a term \(-\frac{7}{4}\,\zeta(3)\log 2\) while Candidate 2 has no \(\zeta(3)\log 2\) term, and all other coefficients differ.  
Evaluating numerically with standard constants gives

• Candidate 1 ≈ −0.02948  
• Candidate 2 ≈ −0.07326

2. Candidate 2:   \(I = \ln A\;-\;{}_1\Psi_0\!\Bigl[(0,c)\mid -\dfrac{B}{A^c}\Bigr]\)

Key discrepancies:

• The first constant terms differ:  \(-\operatorname{Ei}(0)\) vs. \(\ln A\).  These are not the same (indeed \(\operatorname{Ei}(0)\) is divergent while \(\ln A\) is finite for \(A>0\)).

• The arguments fed into the generalized Wright function differ both in sign and in the factor accompanying \(B\):  \(B/(A-1)^c\) vs. \(-B/A^c\).

The two candidates give the same formula on the domain where the density is required, i.e. for \(u\in[0,1]\).

Candidate 1: \(1_{[0,1]}(u)\,\dfrac{f_{X,Y}\bigl(F_X^{*-1}(u),y\bigr)}{f_X\bigl(F_X^{*-1}(u)\bigr)}\)

Candidate 2: \(\dfrac{f_{X,Y}\bigl(F_X^{*-1}(u),y\bigr)}{f_X\bigl(F_X^{*-1}(u)\bigr)}\)

Because the push-forward measure \(\hat\pi\) lives on \([0,1]\times\mathbb R\), the density only needs to be specified for \(u\in[0,1]\). On this set the factor \(1_{[0,1]}(u)\) equals 1, so the two expressions coincide. Any value the density might take outside \([0,1]\) is irrelevant to the question.

Therefore the answers are equivalent.
Both candidates give the density as 
          f_{X,Y}(F_X^{*-1}(u), y) / f_X(F_X^{*-1}(u)).

Candidate 1 multiplies this by the indicator 1_{[0,1]}(u), while Candidate 2 does not.  
Because the question already specifies that the density is with respect to the product Lebesgue measure on [0,1]×ℝ, the function is only relevant on u∈[0,1]; outside this set the density is immaterial. Therefore the extra indicator factor in Candidate 1 is redundant, and the two expressions coincide on the domain of interest.

The two candidates give different analytical expressions.

Candidate 1  
Re Ψ(½ + ℏω / (2π i k_B T)) − ln(ℏω / k_B T)

Candidate 2  
½ Re ψ(½ + ℏω / (4π k_B T)) − ½ ln(ℏω / (4π k_B T))

Main discrepancies:

1. Argument of the digamma:  
   • Candidate 1: ½ − i ℏω/(2π k_B T) (complex)  
   • Candidate 2: ½ + ℏω/(4π k_B T) (real)

2. Overall scaling factors: Candidate 2 has an extra factor ½ in front of both terms.

3. The logarithm’s inside constant differs (k_B T vs 4π k_B T).

No standard identity converts these distinct forms into one another; hence the two results are not the same.

The two candidates both give the numerical answer “1” (candidate 1 writes 1.0, candidate 2 writes 1).  
At six significant digits both are 1.00000; units are the same (none specified). Therefore the predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a single shortest path and expects the answer as an ordered list of nodes.  

Candidate 1 gives the path [4, 1, 2, 0].  
Candidate 2 gives the path [4, 3, 2, 0].

These two ordered lists are different (they contain different intermediate nodes), so they are not equivalent (Rule 3).

The question expects a binary response indicating whether \(W\) is (Yes/True) or is not (No/False) a subspace.

• Candidate 1: “False”  
• Candidate 2: “No”

According to Rule 2-8, “False” and “No” are treated as equivalent ways of saying the answer is negative.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
According to Rule 2, the question requires two numerical answers in an ordered list, so we compare each corresponding entry.

Entry 1  
• Candidate 1: 0.333 → written to six significant digits: 0.333000  
• Candidate 2: 1/3 = 0.333333… → written to six significant digits: 0.333333  

These values differ starting at the fourth significant digit. Rule 4 states two numerical answers are equivalent only if they agree to six significant digits, so these are not equivalent.

Entry 2  
• Candidate 1: 0.25 → 0.250000  
• Candidate 2: 1/4 = 0.25 → 0.250000  

These match, but equivalence requires every corresponding answer to match; the first entry already fails.

Therefore the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different results.

• Candidate 1: 1.3733 → 1.373300 (expressed to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: e^{5/4} − e^{3/4} ≈ 1.37334294 → 1.37334 (to 6 significant digits)

Since 1.373300 ≠ 1.37334 at the sixth significant digit, the answers are not the same.

The question asks for a 2-element list in the specific order [P_r, P_a].  
Candidate 2 gives  
• first element ≈1.3229 kVAR (P_r)  
• second element 2 kVA (P_a).

Candidate 1 gives  
• first element 2.0 (no unit stated)  
• second element 1.32 (no unit stated).

1. The numerical values in corresponding positions do not match (2.0 ≠ 1.3229 and 1.32 ≠ 2).  
2. Candidate 1 omits units, creating ambiguity (Rule 1).  
3. Even if one tried swapping the order, the lists would still not match the required ordering.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question requests TWO pieces of information:
1. The multiplicity of the root ξ = 1.
2. The decimal value of P'(2) + P''(2).

Candidate 1 supplies only a single number: “163.”
Candidate 2 supplies two answers: “*answer 1: 2” (multiplicity) and “*answer 2: 163” (the decimal number).

Since Candidate 1 omits the first required answer, the two response sets are not the same.

• Candidate 1: 7.77778

The quantity required is a single numerical rate (units of m/s).  
• Candidate 1: 1.667  (unit omitted but implicitly m/s).  
• Candidate 2: \( \frac{5}{3}\,\text{m/s}=1.666666\ldots \).

Express both to six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 1.66700  
Candidate 2 → 1.66667  

These differ at the fourth significant digit ( …7 00 vs …6 67 ), so they do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4). Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Numeric value of Candidate 2:

(ln 2)/2 ≈ 0.3465735903  
5/16 = 0.3125  
Difference ≈ 0.0340735903

Expressed to six significant digits:
Candidate 1 → 0.0340000  
Candidate 2 → 0.0340736

The values differ at the 4th significant digit, so they are not equal to 6 significant digits.

The question asks specifically for the wavelength “in nm.”  

• Candidate 1 gives just the number: “0.098” (no unit).  
• Candidate 2 gives “0.098 nm,” explicitly including the unit.

Because multiple units could reasonably apply to a wavelength (nm, Å, m, etc.), omitting the unit creates ambiguity. Under Rule 1, such omissions make the answers inequivalent.

The two answers are of different forms:

• Candidate 1 gives a single numerical value 7.333.  
• Candidate 2 gives a formula \( \frac{2}{3}t^{3} + t \) that depends on the variable \(t\).

These are not generally the same quantity; they coincide only when \(t = 2\), but the question does not specify such a particular value. Hence, according to the guidelines (type mismatch and no clear mapping), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question requests a single numerical value (the real root to three decimals).  

Candidate 1 gives −1.  
Candidate 2 gives −1.167.

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits (−1.00000 vs −1.16700) shows they are different. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same mathematical expression:

Candidate 1: 5 / [2 e^{3t} (3 cos t − sin t)^3]  
Candidate 2: 5 / [2 e^{3t} (3 cos t − sin t)^3]

All factors and exponents match exactly; only formatting differs.

The two answers give different numerical values.

• Candidate 1:  
20 √5 + 4 √2 arctan(√5 / √2)  
≈ 20 × 2.2360679 + 5.656854 × arctan(1.58114)  
≈ 44.7214 + 5.7 ≈ 50.4

• Candidate 2:  
20 √5 ≈ 44.7214

Since 50.4 and 44.7214 differ well beyond six significant digits, the predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: increasing (−π/3, π/3); decreasing (−π/2, −π/3) and (π/3, π/2) – all open.

• Candidate 2: increasing [−π/3, π/3]; decreasing [−π/2, −π/3] and [π/3, π/2] – all closed, hence they include the two critical points x = ±π/3, where f ′(x)=0.

Because the sets differ at those end-points, the answers to sub-parts 1 and 2 are not identical. Rule 2 states that every sub-answer must match; a discrepancy in even one sub-answer makes the whole sets of answers inequivalent.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two values (both the maximum and the minimum).  

• Candidate 1 supplies two numbers:  
  – Maximum = (5 √2 √(5+√5))/4  
  – Minimum = 0  

• Candidate 2 gives only a single number: 0.

Since Candidate 2 omits the maximum value, the two candidates do not provide the same set of required answers. According to Rule 2, they are therefore inequivalent.

The two candidates give

• Candidate 1: y = |x| / 3 − 4  
• Candidate 2: y =  x / 3 − 4

These expressions are identical only when x > 0 (since |x| = x there).  
For x < 0 they differ: Candidate 1 gives y = −x/3 − 4 while Candidate 2 gives y =  x/3 − 4.  
Therefore the two proposed functions are not the same on the whole domain where the differential equation is defined (x ≠ 0).  

Because the question did not specify that x must be positive, the two answers are not mathematically identical, so they are not considered equivalent under the rules.

Both candidates represent the quantity

I₁ = ∫₀^{π/6} cos²(3θ) dθ.

Candidate 1 gives this integral directly.

Candidate 2 gives (½)∫_{−π/6}^{π/6} cos²(3θ) dθ.  
Because cos²(3θ) is an even function,  
∫_{−π/6}^{π/6} cos²(3θ) dθ = 2∫₀^{π/6} cos²(3θ) dθ = 2I₁.  
Multiplying by ½ yields I₁ again.

Thus the two expressions are mathematically identical.

Candidate 1 writes  
 –2/27 ln[(1/3)(1 + 3 x^{1/6})] = –2/27 [ln(1 + 3 x^{1/6}) + ln(1/3)],  
which differs from Candidate 2 only by –2/27 ln(1/3), a constant independent of x.  
All algebraic (power) terms are identical after simplifying √[6]{x}^k to x^{k/6}.  
Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant, the two results are the same.

Indeed  

Candidate 1:  
 −(2 cos)/(5 sin⁵) − (8/15) cos/sin³ − (16/15) cos/sin

Since the two expressions differ only by algebraic rearrangement (and an arbitrary integration constant), they are equivalent.

The question asks for two quantities: 

1. the length of the gallery  
2. the height at the center.

Candidate 1 gives  
• length = 96 ft  
• height ≈ 26.53 ft  

Candidate 2 gives  
• length = 96 ft  
• height = 8√11 ft.

Numerically, 8√11 ft = 26.532998… ft.  
Comparing the heights to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 26.5300 (implicit trailing zeros)  
• Candidate 2: 26.5330 (rounded from 26.532998)

Since 26.5300 ≠ 26.5330 at six significant digits, the two height values do not match.  
Because one of the two required sub-answers differs, the overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for two numerical values: the length and the height at the center of the gallery (both in feet).

Candidate 1:  
• Length = 96 ft  
• Height ≈ 26.53 ft  (interpreted numerically as 26.530000 when expanded to 6 significant digits)

Candidate 2:  
• Length = 96 ft  
• Height = 8√11 ft → 8 × √11 ≈ 26.532998 ft → 26.5330 when rounded to 6 significant digits

Length: 96 ft matches exactly for both candidates.

Height:  
Compare at 6 significant digits (Rule 4):  
• Candidate 1: 26.530000  
• Candidate 2: 26.533000  

These differ starting at the 3rd digit after the decimal point; therefore they do NOT match to 6 significant digits.

Since one of the requested numerical answers (height) does not coincide to the required precision, the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates are definite-integral expressions; we just have to see whether the two integrals are algebraically identical.

Let  
I = ∫₀^{π⁄4} sin²θ dθ.

Candidate 1: 9 I.

Candidate 2:
(1/2) ∫₀^{π⁄4} (3 sin θ)² dθ + (1/2) ∫_{π⁄4}^{π⁄2} (3 cos θ)² dθ  
= (9/2) ∫₀^{π⁄4} sin²θ dθ + (9/2) ∫_{π⁄4}^{π⁄2} cos²θ dθ.

Notice  
∫_{π⁄4}^{π⁄2} cos²θ dθ = ∫_{0}^{π⁄4} sin²u du  
(by substitution u = π/2 − θ), which equals I.

Thus Candidate 2 becomes (9/2)(I + I) = 9 I, exactly the same as Candidate 1.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

Candidate 2:  dy/dx = [4x(ln x + 1) − 3y] / [3x(ln x + 2)]

The two answers are not unambiguously the same.

• Candidate 2 explicitly states “0.3 %”.

• Candidate 1 gives just “0.003” with no unit.  
  – If this 0.003 is meant as a pure (dimensionless) fraction, it corresponds to 0.3 %, matching Candidate 2.  
  – But since the question specifically asks for a percentage, it is also possible to read 0.003 as 0.003 %, which would be an order-of-magnitude smaller.

Because the omission of the % symbol in Candidate 1 leaves room for this ambiguity when multiple unit conventions are possible, Rule 1 says the answers should be considered inequivalent.

Both candidates give two roots, as required.

Candidate 1: x = 2 ± √(13/2)

Rewrite √(13/2):

√(13/2) = √(26)/2

So the roots are
x = 2 ± √26 / 2 = (4 ± √26)/2.

Candidate 2 lists exactly these two numbers: (4 + √26)/2 and (4 − √26)/2 (with decimal approximations).

Thus each corresponding root is identical, merely written in different but algebraically equivalent forms, and the order is irrelevant here.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

We need to check whether the two numerical answers coincide.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value  
  -0.5244.

For Candidate 2 we evaluate  
  4 ln 2 – 3 ln 3 – (5 ln 6)/7776.

1. 4 ln 2  = 2.772588722239781  
2. 3 ln 3  = 3.295836866004329  
   ⇒ 4 ln 2 – 3 ln 3 = –0.523248143764548  
3. 5 ln 6 = 8.958797346140275  
   (5 ln 6)/7776 ≈ 0.0011521087  

Therefore  
  4 ln 2 – 3 ln 3 – (5 ln 6)/7776  
  ≈ –0.523248143764548 – 0.0011521087  
  ≈ –0.5244002525.

Rounded (or written) to six significant digits this is  
  -0.524400.

Candidate 1’s number –0.5244 corresponds to –0.524400 when written with six significant digits.  
Since both results match to six significant digits, the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical value:  
-0.5244 → interpreted as ‑0.524400 (to six significant digits).

Candidate 2 gives an exact expression  
-3 ln 3  – (5 ln 6)/7776  + 2 ln 4.  
Evaluating this numerically:

ln 3 ≈ 1.098612, ln 6 ≈ 1.791759, ln 4 ≈ 1.386294  
-3 ln 3 ≈ ‑3.295836866  
-(5 ln 6)/7776 ≈ ‑0.001152383  
2 ln 4 ≈ 2.772588722  

Sum ≈ ‑0.524400527.

Thus Candidate 2’s value to six significant digits is ‑0.524401, while Candidate 1’s is ‑0.524400.  
The sixth significant digit differs (…400 vs …401). According to Rule 4, the two answers must match exactly to six significant digits; they do not.

Candidate 1 gives the curvature as  

κ₁(t) = 1 / [16 · |sin(t/2)|].

Candidate 2 gives the curvature as  

κ₂(t) = 1 / [16 · sin(t/2)].

Because κ₁ always uses the absolute value, it is non-negative for all t (as curvature should be), whereas κ₂ can be negative whenever sin(t/2) < 0.  
Since the two expressions differ by the presence/absence of the absolute-value operation, they are not algebraically identical and do not yield the same value for many t (e.g., t = 3π where sin(t/2) = –1).  

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different formulas:

• Candidate 1: κ = 1 / [16 |sin(t/2)|] (absolute value)  
• Candidate 2: κ = 1 / [16 sin(t/2)] (no absolute value)

Because the second expression can be negative whenever sin(t/2) < 0, while curvature must be non-negative, the two answers are not mathematically equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical quantity (the number of leaves remaining).  
Candidate 1 gives 7426 leaves, while Candidate 2 gives 7427 leaves.  
Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 7426.00000  
• Candidate 2: 7427.00000  

They differ (by one leaf), so they are not identical at six‐significant‐digit precision (Rule 4). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

 5/128 x − sin³(4x)/96 − sin(8x)/256 − sin(16x)/2048 + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2’s expression.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that, once the numerical factors in Candidate 1 are multiplied out and like terms combined, become exactly

5/128 x  − 1/96 sin³(4x)  − 1/256 sin(8x)  − 1/2048 sin(16x) + C,

which is the expression stated by Candidate 2 (up to the constant of integration).  
Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give exactly the same ordered pairs for each function:

2.  For \(y=\log_{a}x\): \(\bigl(\frac{1}{\ln a},\,-\frac{\ln(\ln a)}{\ln a}\bigr)\)

The expressions are identical (only minor formatting differences), and each candidate supplies both required coordinates. Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

Both answers are single antiderivatives of the same integrand, so we just need to see whether the two expressions differ by at most an additive constant.

Candidate 1:
I₁(x)=½ sin(x/2) cos³(x/2)+¾ sin(x/2) cos(x/2)+3x/8+C  
Rewrite with double–angle identities (s=sin(x/2), c=cos(x/2)):

• sin(x/2) cos(x/2)= sin x /2  
• sin(x/2) cos³(x/2)= (sin x /2)·c² = (sin x /2)·(1+cos x)/2 = sin x(1+cos x)/4

Hence  
I₁ = [½·sin x(1+cos x)/4] + [¾·sin x /2] + 3x/8 + C  
  = sin x(1+cos x)/8 + 3 sin x/8 + 3x/8 + C  
  = (1/8) sin x(4+cos x) + 3x/8 + C  
  = (1/2) sin x + (1/8) sin x cos x + 3x/8 + C.

Candidate 2:
I₂(x)=3x/8 + ½ sin x + 1/16 sin (2x) + C.

But sin (2x)=2 sin x cos x, so  
1/16 sin (2x)= (1/16)·2 sin x cos x = (1/8) sin x cos x.

Hence  
I₂ = 3x/8 + ½ sin x + (1/8) sin x cos x + C.

Comparing the simplified forms, I₁ and I₂ are identical term-by-term (and therefore differ only by the arbitrary constant C that is already included). Thus the two candidates are equivalent.

The two expressions can be rewritten for comparison.

Candidate 1  
C₁(x) = C − (1/9)(1 + 3/x²)^{3/2}  
   = C − (1/9)(x² + 3)^{3/2}/(x²)^{3/2}  
   = C − (1/9)(x² + 3)^{3/2}/(|x|³).

Candidate 2  
C₂(x) = −(x² + 3)^{3/2}/(9x³) + C.

For x > 0, |x| = x, so C₁(x) = C₂(x) (they differ only by the constant C).

For x < 0, |x| = −x, hence

 C₁(x) = −(x² + 3)^{3/2}/[9(−x)³] = −(x² + 3)^{3/2}/(−9x³)  
    = +(x² + 3)^{3/2}/(9x³),

whereas

 C₂(x) = −(x² + 3)^{3/2}/(9x³).

Thus, on x < 0 the two expressions are opposite in sign and differ by a non-constant amount (not merely by an additive constant). Therefore the candidates are not equivalent as antiderivatives over the full real domain of the integrand.

The two antiderivatives differ only in the last term:

• Candidate 1 uses  − arctan(cot x)  
• Candidate 2 uses  x

Compute the derivative of − arctan(cot x):

d/dx[−arctan(cot x)] = − [ (−csc²x)/(1+cot²x) ] = 1 ,

since 1+cot²x = csc²x.  
Thus d/dx[−arctan(cot x)] = 1 = d/dx[x].

Hence x and − arctan(cot x) differ only by a constant (indeed −arctan(cot x) = x − π/2 on the principal branch), and any constant difference is absorbed into the arbitrary integration constant C.

All other terms are identical in both candidates, so the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

The two candidates are not fully equivalent.  
Both give the same maximizing point, (x,y) = (12/5, 6/5) = (2.4, 1.2), but Candidate 1 also supplies the maximum utility value (≈ 16.715) whereas Candidate 2 omits this value.  
Because the problem of “maximizing” a function customarily requires reporting both the maximizing point and the attained maximum value, Candidate 2 provides fewer of the required outputs.  
Hence the answers are considered inequivalent.

Both antiderivatives can differ at most by an additive constant.  
Setting  

s = √(x − 3), t = √(x + 3), so that √((x+3)/(x−3)) = t/s and √(x²−9) = st,

one finds that the non-logarithmic parts of the two expressions cancel exactly, while the logarithmic parts satisfy  

(x + st) · (t − s)/(s + t) = 3.

Hence the difference between Candidate 2 and Candidate 1 equals 9 ln 3, a constant independent of x (on any connected domain where the logs are defined).  
Therefore the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions represent antiderivatives that differ only by an (x-independent) constant:

• Writing  
 s = √(x+3), t = √(x−3),

 √((x+3)/(x−3)) = s/t, √(x²−9) = st.

• Candidate 1 yields  
 E₁ = (s/t)(x−15) − 9 ln| (t−s)/(t+s) |.

• Candidate 2 yields  
 E₂ = st − 12(s/t) − 9 ln((x−st)/3).

• Combine the algebra:

 (st/t)(x−15) + 12(s/t) = (s/t)(x−3) = st,

 so E₁ − E₂ = 9[ln((x−st)/3) − ln| (t−s)/(t+s) |].

 But  
 (x−st)/3 ÷ |(t−s)/(t+s)| = 1,  
 hence the bracketed logarithm is ln 1 = 0 for all x in the domain.

Therefore E₁ − E₂ is a constant, and the two antiderivatives are equivalent up to an arbitrary constant of integration.

The question asks to “Find points … that satisfy the equation,” which implies listing **all** solutions.  

• Candidate 1 supplies only the point (1, –2) without stating that no others exist.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly asserts that (1, –2) is **the only** point satisfying the equation.

Because Candidate 2 claims uniqueness while Candidate 1 does not, the two responses are not logically identical: Candidate 1 could be merely giving one example, whereas Candidate 2 gives a complete (singleton) set. Hence, under Rule 2 they are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the following results.

Candidate 1:  
π/12 + √3/2 + arcsin(1)/2 − 3/2  
Since arcsin(1) = π/2, this simplifies to  
π/12 + √3/2 + π/4 − 3/2  
= π(1/12 + 1/4) + √3/2 − 3/2  
= π(1/12 + 3/12) + √3/2 − 3/2  
= π/3 + √3/2 − 3/2.

Candidate 2:  
π/3 + √3/2 − 3/2.

Thus both candidates give exactly the same value.

Both candidates express q(x) as a Fourier integral over the positive frequency axis with the same integrand (up to the dummy integration variable name).  
For the cosine term:

• Candidate 1: (α sin α + cos α − 1)/α²  
• Candidate 2: sin ω/ω + ( cos ω − 1 )/ω² = (ω sin ω + cos ω − 1)/ω²  

These are identical after multiplying the first summand of Candidate 2 by ω/ω.

For the sine term:

• Candidate 1: ( sin α − α cos α )/α²  
• Candidate 2: − cos ω/ω + sin ω/ω² = ( sin ω − ω cos ω )/ω²  

Again identical after combining over a common denominator.  
The integration limits (0 → ∞) and the trigonometric factors cos(…x), sin(…x) match as well. The only difference is the dummy variable name α vs. ω, which has no mathematical effect.

Thus the two expressions are the same Fourier integral representation of q(x).

The two antiderivative formulas coincide (up to an additive constant) for \(x>0\), but for \(x<0\) candidate 1 acquires an overall minus sign because
\[
\sqrt{\frac{1}{x^{2}}}= \frac1{|x|},
\]
whereas candidate 2 involves no absolute-value factor.  Hence, on the negative-\(x\) side candidate 1 equals \(-\!\)(candidate 2), which is not just a constant offset; their derivatives differ by a sign there.  Since the expressions are not globally the same antiderivative, the answers are not equivalent.

The question requires two numerical answers (period and number of periods in 1 s).  
We must compare each pair of corresponding answers.

Sub-answer 1 (period)  
• Candidate 1: π/184 ≈ 0.0170769 s  
• Candidate 2: 0.0171 s = 0.0171000 s (to 6 significant digits)  
Comparing to 6 significant digits, 0.0170769 ≠ 0.0171000 (difference appears at the 3rd significant digit).  
⇒ Not equivalent.

Sub-answer 2 (periods in 1 s)  
• Candidate 1: 58.56901906  
• Candidate 2: 58.6 = 58.600000 (to 6 significant digits)  
58.569019 ≠ 58.600000 (difference at the 3rd significant digit).  
⇒ Not equivalent.

The question requests nine separate pieces of information.  
Although the first four items are the same in the two candidates, clear discrepancies occur in the later items:

• Increasing intervals:  
  – C1: (-∞,-9) ∪ (-3,0) ∪ (0,∞) (excludes the point 0)  
  – C2: (-∞,-9) ∪ (-3,∞) (includes the point 0)  
  These sets are not identical.

• Concavity:  
  – C1 lists (-3,0) in both “concave up” and “concave down,” and also lists (-∞,-9) as concave up.  
  – C2 gives concave up only on (0,∞) and concave down on (-∞,-3) ∪ (-3,0).  
  The two descriptions are plainly different (and C1 is internally inconsistent).

Because at least one sub-answer differs, Rule 2 dictates the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Both list the same critical point, (0, 0).

• Their classifications differ:
  – Candidate 1 says the second-derivative test is inconclusive at (0, 0) (i.e., no definite classification).

Because they give different final classifications for the critical point, the predictions are not identical.

Both antiderivatives differ by  

arctan(tan x) – x,

which is constant on any interval where tan x is continuous (e.g., (−π/2, π/2)).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

The two antiderivatives differ in the term “arctan(tan x)” (Candidate 1) versus “x” (Candidate 2).

Although on an interval where tan x is continuous we have arctan(tan x)=x+ kπ (with k an integer constant on that interval), the value of k changes from interval to interval; hence there is no single constant C that makes the two expressions differ only by an overall constant for all x. Therefore the two results are not the same antiderivative globally.

Both expressions can be rewritten for comparison:

Candidate 1  
S₁ = (π/4)·(12√2 + ln(17 + 12√2))  
   = π·3√2 + (π/4)·ln(17 + 12√2)

Candidate 2  
S₂ = π·(3√2 + ln(1 + √2))  
   = π·3√2 + π·ln(1 + √2)

Note that  
(1 + √2)⁴ = (1 + √2)²² = (3 + 2√2)² = 17 + 12√2,  
so ln(17 + 12√2) = ln[(1 + √2)⁴] = 4 ln(1 + √2).

Therefore  
(π/4)·ln(17 + 12√2) = (π/4)·4 ln(1 + √2) = π ln(1 + √2).

Hence S₁ = S₂.

The two candidates give exactly the same polynomial:

Candidate 2:  \(P_{5}(x) = x + x^{2} + \dfrac{1}{3}x^{3} - \dfrac{1}{30}x^{5}\)

All coefficients and powers match; there is no difference in notation or content. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.

Both candidates express the antiderivative in terms of

t = tan(x/2)

and contain exactly the same three elementary parts:

1.  − ln (1 + t^{2/3})
2.  +(1/2) ln (1 + t^{4/3} − t^{2/3})
3.  − √3 arctan[(2 t^{2/3} − 1)/√3]

up to an arbitrary additive constant.

Candidate 1 writes the second logarithm as  

 ln|1 + t^{1/3} t − t^{2/3}| = ln|1 + t^{4/3} − t^{2/3}|,  

which is the same expression candidate 2 gives (without the absolute–value bars).  
The absolute value merely changes the result by at most a constant, which is absorbed in the “+ C.”  
All other terms match identically, including signs and coefficients.

Hence the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by an overall constant of integration and are therefore equivalent.

Both candidates give

S(x) = (1/4) ln( (1+x)/(1−x) ) − (1/2) arctan x,

except that Candidate 1 inserts absolute-value bars around the arguments of the logarithm:

(1/4) ln( |1+x| / |1−x| ) − (1/2) arctan x.

For the domain where the power series actually converges (|x|<1), the quantities 1+x and 1−x are positive, so the absolute values do nothing; the two formulas coincide exactly. Thus, within the intended domain of the question the two expressions are mathematically identical, and the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 2: I(x)=−(3/8) ln[tan²(4x) + √(tan⁴(4x)+1)] + C.

The logarithm arguments are identical because addition is commutative, and the overall form is −(3/8) ln(argument) plus an arbitrary integration constant. Hence the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by a re-labeling of the constant of integration, which is allowed.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of the form  
−(3/8) ln( tan²(4x) + √(tan⁴(4x)+1) ) plus an arbitrary constant.

• Candidate 2: −(3/8) ln(tan²(4x) + √(tan⁴(4x)+1)) + C

The logarithm arguments are identical (addition is commutative), and the overall difference in the additive constant is absorbed into the arbitrary integration constant. Therefore the two expressions represent the same antiderivative.

The two antiderivatives are  

Candidate 1: F₁(x)= (1/3) sec³x + 2 sec x + cos x + C₁  
Candidate 2: F₂(x)= (1/3) sec³x − 2 sec x − cos x + C₂  

Compute the difference (ignoring the arbitrary constants):

F₁(x) − F₂(x) = 4 sec x + 2 cos x.

This difference is not a constant, because

d/dx [4 sec x + 2 cos x] = 4 sec x tan x − 2 sin x ≠ 0 in general.

Since the two expressions do not differ merely by an additive constant, the antiderivatives (and thus the answers) are not equivalent.

The two candidate expressions are:

Candidate 1: \((\frac{3}{2})x - 3\)

Candidate 2: \(\frac{3(x-2)}{2}\)

Expanding Candidate 2:
\[
\frac{3(x-2)}{2} = \frac{3}{2}x - \frac{3}{2}\cdot 2 = \frac{3}{2}x - 3,
\]
which is exactly the same as Candidate 1.

Candidate 1: (3/2)x − 3

Since 3(x − 2)/2 expands exactly to (3/2)x − 3, the two expressions are identical for all x (with the usual implied restriction x ≠ −2 that accompanies both).

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 allows two independent integers \(n\) and \(k\), so \(x\) and \(y\) can be shifted by independent multiples of \(2\pi\).  
Candidate 2 uses only one integer \(k\); it always adds the same \(2\pi\)-multiple to \(x\) and \(y\) simultaneously.  Hence it does not cover solutions where, for example, \(x\) is increased by \(2\pi\) while \(y\) is left unchanged (a possibility included in Candidate 1).

Because Candidate 2 describes a smaller set of \((x,y)\) pairs than Candidate 1, the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The system requires giving ALL ordered pairs (x,y) that satisfy the two trigonometric products.  
Both candidates try to describe the same two 1-parameter families of solutions:

Family A : (x , y) = (π/6 + πk/2 , π/3 + πk/2)  
Family B : (x , y) = (π/3 + πk/2 , π/6 + πk/2) , k ∈ ℤ.

Candidate 2 writes exactly these two families, with a single integer k.

Candidate 1 rewrites the same families with two integers n and k:

• First alternative  
 x = π/3 + π/2(2n+k) = π/3 + πk/2 + πn  
 y = π/6 + π/2(k−2n) = π/6 + πk/2 − πn

• Second alternative  
 x = π/6 + π/2(2n+k) = π/6 + πk/2 + πn  
 y = π/3 + π/2(k−2n) = π/3 + πk/2 − πn

Because adding ±πn to x and y while adding ∓πn to the other variable keeps
sin x sin y and cos x cos y unchanged, these extra ±πn shifts only generate the
same points as Candidate 2 (or points differing by integer multiples of 2π,
which are identical for sine and cosine).  Conversely, every point in
Candidate 2 is obtained from Candidate 1 by taking n = 0.

Thus the two parameterisations describe exactly the same solution set (Candidate 1 merely lists each solution repeatedly by introducing the extra integer n).

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The two expressions differ by the absolute-value sign inside the logarithm:

  – defined only for x > 0.

• Candidate 2:  (ln b / ln a) ln|x|  
  – defined for all real x ≠ 0.

Because the problem statement allows any x ≠ 0 (no sign restriction), the integral should be expressed with ln|x|. Candidate 1 omits the absolute value, thus its formula is not valid on the whole domain required by the question. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 provides two distinct families of solutions:
1. x = 2π k − 2 arctan 7
2. x = π + 2π k          (k ∈ ℤ)

Candidate 2 gives only one family:
   x = π + arctan(7/24) + 2π k  (k ∈ ℤ)

Using the identity arctan(7/24) = π − 2 arctan 7, Candidate 2’s expression can be rewritten as
   x = 2π − 2 arctan 7 + 2π k = −2 arctan 7 + 2π(k+1),
which coincides with Candidate 1’s first family (just with an index shift).  

However, Candidate 2 does not reproduce Candidate 1’s second family x = π + 2π k.  
Since the problem asks for all solutions and Candidate 2 omits one entire family, the two answer sets are not the same.

Both candidates differentiate to the same integrand  
 d/dx (Candidate 1) = 2 cot⁶(14x)  
 d/dx (Candidate 2) = 2 cot⁶(14x),

so each is a valid antiderivative of 2 cot⁶(14x). Their difference,
 (Candidate 2 – Candidate 1) = –2x – (1/7) arctan(cot 14x),
reduces (using arctan(cot θ) = π/2 – θ + kπ) to a piece-wise constant value on every connected interval where the integrand is defined, hence they differ only by an additive constant. Therefore the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give an antiderivative; they are equivalent if their difference is a constant.

Rewrite Candidate 1:

F₁(x)=−(1/7)[(1/5)cot⁵(14x)+cot(14x)−(1/3)cot³(14x)−arctan(cot(14x))]+C  
  =−cot⁵(14x)/35 + cot³(14x)/21 − cot(14x)/7 + (1/7)arctan(cot(14x)) + C.

Candidate 2:

F₂(x)=−cot⁵(14x)/35 + cot³(14x)/21 − cot(14x)/7 − 2x + C.

Difference:

F₁−F₂ = (1/7)arctan(cot(14x)) + 2x + const.

Now note

d/dx[arctan(cot(14x))] = -14  
⇒ arctan(cot(14x)) = π/2 − 14x  (up to an additive multiple of π, i.e. a constant).

Hence
(1/7)arctan(cot(14x)) + 2x = (1/7)(π/2 −14x) + 2x
                           = π/14  (a constant).

Therefore F₁−F₂ equals a constant; their derivatives are identical (2 cot⁶(14x)), so the two antiderivatives are the same up to an additive constant.

Thus Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are equivalent.

Both candidates give the expression

    −x − 2√x − 2 ln( … ),

with the only difference being the argument of the logarithm:

• Candidate 1: ln |√x − 1|  
• Candidate 2: ln (1 − √x)

The series converges for |√x|<1, i.e. for real x in 0 ≤ x < 1.  
On this domain 1 − √x > 0, hence |√x − 1| = 1 − √x and

ln |√x − 1| = ln (1 − √x).

Therefore the two formulas coincide everywhere the real series sum is defined, and the extra absolute-value bars in Candidate 1 introduce no difference.

Hence the two answers are mathematically equivalent for the intended domain of the problem.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
### Reasoning:
The infinite series converges only for |x| < 1, so for real x we have 0 ≤ x < 1.  
In that interval 1 – √x > 0, hence  
 |√x – 1| = 1 – √x.

Therefore  
 ln|√x – 1| = ln(1 – √x).

Both candidates give exactly the same overall expression
  –x – 2√x – 2 ln(1 – √x)  
on the domain where the series is defined.  
Thus the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an algebraic rearrangement:

Candidate 1:
2·sin³(x/2)/cos(x/2) − (3/2)x + (3/2)sin x
= 2[sin³(x/2)/cos(x/2)]
   − (3/2)x + (3/2)sin x
Note sin³/ cos = sin/cos − sin cos = tan(x/2) − ½ sin x,
so 2[sin³/ cos] = 2tan(x/2) − sin x.

Therefore Candidate 1 simplifies to
2tan(x/2) − (3/2)x + ½ sin x + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2.

Hence the two answers differ at most by an additive constant and are equivalent.
Candidate 1’s answer:
2 sin³(x/2)/cos(x/2) − (3/2)x + (3/2) sin x + C

Rewrite the first term:
sin³(θ)/cos θ = sin θ (1 − cos² θ)/cos θ = tan θ − sin θ cos θ  
⇒ 2 sin³(θ)/cos θ = 2 tan θ − 2 sin θ cos θ = 2 tan θ − sin(2θ)

With θ = x/2, sin(2θ) = sin x, so

2 sin³(x/2)/cos(x/2) = 2 tan(x/2) − sin x.

Substitute back:

Candidate 1 = [2 tan(x/2) − sin x] − (3/2)x + (3/2) sin x  
      = 2 tan(x/2) − (3/2)x + (−sin x + (3/2) sin x)  
      = 2 tan(x/2) − (3/2)x + (1/2) sin x + C.

This is exactly Candidate 2’s expression (apart from the arbitrary constant C). Therefore the two answers differ only by a constant of integration and are mathematically equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.  
• For sub-answer 1 (domain) Candidate 1 includes 2⁄3 in the domain (interval (-2⁄3, 1)) and omits nothing at x = 1, while Candidate 2 correctly excludes x = ±2⁄3 and gives (-∞, -2⁄3)∪(-2⁄3, 2⁄3)∪(2⁄3, ∞).  
• Because of this difference, their subsequent concavity interval in item 8 also differs.  

Since at least one required answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates are NOT equivalent.

• Sub-answer 1 (domain) is different:  
 Candidate 1 gives (−∞, −2⁄3) ∪ (−2⁄3, 1) ∪ (2⁄3, ∞) whereas  
 Candidate 2 gives (−∞, −2⁄3) ∪ (−2⁄3, 2⁄3) ∪ (2⁄3, ∞).

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the entire sets of answers are inequivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 2:  sin(na/2) · sin((n+1)a/2) / sin(a/2)

Both candidates give an antiderivative of  

∫ 2 tan⁴(–10x) dx = ∫ 2 tan⁴(10x) dx.  

Rewrite Candidate 1:  
(1/5)[(1/3)tan³(10x) + arctan(tan(10x)) – tan(10x)] + C  
  = tan³(10x)/15 – tan(10x)/5 + (1/5) arctan(tan(10x)) + C.

Candidate 2:  
tan³(10x)/15 – tan(10x)/5 + 2x + C.

The two differ by  
Δ = 2x – (1/5) arctan(tan(10x)).  

For x where tan(10x) is continuous, arctan(tan(10x)) = 10x – nπ (n integer).  
Hence Δ = 2x – (1/5)(10x – nπ) = 2x – 2x + nπ/5 = constant on each continuity interval.  

Since antiderivatives may differ by an arbitrary constant, the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives of the integrand (the discontinuities come from the integrand itself).

Therefore Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are equivalent.
The two expressions differ by  

(1/5) arctan(tan 10x) – 2x  
= (1/5)[arctan(tan 10x) – 10x].

On any interval where tan (10x) is continuous (i.e. between its vertical asymptotes),  
arctan(tan θ) = θ + kπ for some fixed integer k on that interval, so the bracket is the constant kπ.  
Hence on every connected part of the domain where the integrand is defined, the two antiderivatives differ only by a (possibly different) constant; their derivatives are identical and equal to the integrand 2 tan⁴(–10x)=2 tan⁴(10x).

Therefore Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 represent the same family of antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates are antiderivatives of the same integrand.  

• Simplifying the integrand:  
 2 tan(−10 x)⁴ = 2 tan(10 x)⁴.

• Candidate 1:  
 F₁(x)=C+(1/15)tan³(10x)+(1/5)arctan(tan(10x))−(1/5)tan(10x).

 F₁′(x)=2 tan⁴(10x).

• Candidate 2:  
 F₂(x)=C+2x−(1/5)tan(10x)+(1/15)tan³(10x).

 F₂′(x)=2 tan⁴(10x).

Thus each differentiates to the required integrand.

Their difference is  
 F₁(x)−F₂(x)=(1/5)arctan(tan(10x))−2x.  
On any interval where tan(10x) is continuous (i.e., between its vertical asymptotes), arctan(tan(10x)) = 10x + constant, so the difference reduces to a constant. Hence the two antiderivatives differ only by an additive (piece-wise) constant, which is acceptable for an indefinite integral.

Therefore the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers are antiderivatives of 2 tan⁴(–10 x).

1.  Candidate 1 simplifies to  
   F₁(x)= (1/15)tan³(10x) – (1/5)tan(10x) + (1/5)arctan(tan(10x)) + C.

2.  Candidate 2 is  
   F₂(x)= 2x – (1/5)tan(10x) + (1/15)tan³(10x) + C.

3.  Their difference is  
   F₁(x) – F₂(x) = (1/5)arctan(tan(10x)) – 2x.

   On any interval where tan(10x) is continuous, arctan(tan(10x)) = 10x – kπ (k is a fixed integer on that interval), so  
   F₁ – F₂ = (1/5)(10x – kπ) – 2x = –kπ/5, a constant on that interval.

4.  Hence F₁ and F₂ have identical derivatives (both give 2 tan⁴(10x)) and differ only by an additive constant (possibly different constants on different continuity intervals of the integrand). This is acceptable for indefinite integrals.

Therefore the two candidates are mathematically equivalent antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an overall constant:

1.  The logarithmic parts coincide:
   • Candidate 1 gives −(21/4) ln|tan x| after simplification, identical to Candidate 2.

2.  The algebraic (non-log) terms coincide:
   • Candidate 1 simplifies to −7/(2 cos 2x) + 7 cos 2x / (4 sin² 2x),
   • Candidate 2 has exactly the same two terms.

Since antiderivatives may differ by an arbitrary constant, the two expressions represent the same family of primitives for the integral.

Candidate 2 explicitly assigns \$12 500 to the 4 % bond and \$10 500 to the 2 % bond.  
Candidate 1 lists them as x = 12 500, y = 10 500; in the usual setup of such problems x denotes the first (4 %) bond and y the second (2 %) bond, which matches Candidate 2’s assignment and yields the correct total interest of \$710.

Both answers give an antiderivative of  
F(x)=√(1+x²)/x.

Let A=√(1+x²).

Candidate 1:  
F₁ = A + ½ ln|(A−1)/(A+1)| + C.

Note  
(A−1)/(A+1)=x²/(A+1)² ⇒ ln|(A−1)/(A+1)| = ln x² − 2 ln(A+1)=2 ln|x| − 2 ln(A+1).

Hence  
F₁ = A + ½[2 ln|x| − 2 ln(A+1)] = A − ln((A+1)/|x|) + C.

Candidate 2:  
F₂ = A − ln((A+1)/x) + C.

For x>0, |x| = x, so F₁ = F₂ + constant.  
Candidate 2 implicitly assumes x>0 (common when the absolute–value bars are dropped). The two expressions therefore differ, at most, by an additive constant and represent the same antiderivative on any connected domain where they are defined.

Thus the two candidates are mathematically equivalent (up to the usual arbitrary integration constant).

−(1/32) sin³ 4x, giving exactly Candidate 2:

(3/16)x − (3/128) sin 8x − (1/32) sin³ 4x + C.

Hence they differ at most by a constant of integration and are equivalent.

 = (1/5)[−3 c + 5(1−c) + 8c(1−c) + 8c²] with c = cos²x  
 = (1/5)[5] = 1.

Hence Candidate 2 = 1/(sin²x cos⁶x), which is exactly Candidate 1.

Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

The two antiderivatives are

Candidate 1: 2x ln(√(2−x)+√(2+x)) − [(C+x) − 2 arcsin(x/2)]
      = 2x ln(√(2−x)+√(2+x)) − x + 2 arcsin(x/2) − C.

Candidate 2: 2x ln(√(2−x)+√(2+x)) − x + 2 arcsin(x/2) + C.

Both expressions differ only by the overall constant of integration (−C vs. +C), which is arbitrary for an indefinite integral. Therefore they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Order is not required by the question, and no other differences exist.

Both candidates give the same answer for part 1 (1/27 cm²).

For part 2:
• Candidate 1: 2.52 h  → 2.52000 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 4 ln 2 / ln 3 ≈ 2.5237 h → 2.52370 (to six significant digits)

Since 2.52000 ≠ 2.52370 at six significant digits, the answers for part 2 differ.  
Because at least one sub-answer is different, the overall predictions are not equivalent.
The problem asks for two numerical answers.  
For sub-answer 1, both candidates give exactly 1/27 cm².  
For sub-answer 2, Candidate 1 gives 2.52 h (interpreted as 2.52000 to six significant digits), while Candidate 2 gives 2.5237 h (2.52370).  

Comparing these values to six significant digits per Rule 4:  
2.52000 ≠ 2.52370.  

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the sets of answers are not identical.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The numerical value of Candidate 1 is  
2/(0.3)³ × (0.7)⁴/4! ≈ 0.741049.

Candidate 2 gives 0.7410, which corresponds to 0.741000 to six significant digits.

Comparing six significant digits:  
0.741049 ≠ 0.741000.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem asks for all solutions (x, y).  
Candidate 1 supplies an infinite family:  
 x = π/2 + π k, y = π/6 – π k, k ∈ ℤ.  

Candidate 2 supplies only one pair:  
 x = π/2, y = π/6.  

Candidate 2 corresponds to the single case k = 0 of Candidate 1 and omits all other integer values.  
Since the question requires the full set of solutions (Rule 2) and Candidate 2 gives only a subset, the two answers are not equivalent.

Based on Rule 2 and Rule 3:

• The question asks for two specific quantities, x and y.  
• Candidate 1 explicitly identifies them: “x = 3, y = 2.”  
• Candidate 2 only lists the numbers “3” and “2” without stating which is x and which is y (*answer 1, *answer 2).  

As illustrated in Example 3-3, when variables must be matched to specific values, an unlabeled list (“0, 3”) is not equivalent to a labeled answer (“a = 0, b = 3”) because the correspondence is ambiguous. The same ambiguity exists here.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Sub-problem comparison:

1. Question explicitly asks for pints → unique unit.  
   Candidate 1: “6” (implicit pints) vs Candidate 2: “6 pt” → same value, no ambiguity.

2. Question explicitly asks for cups → unique unit.  
   6 (implicit cups) vs 6 c → equivalent.

3. Question explicitly asks for meters → unique unit.  
   25000 (implicit m) vs 25000 m → equivalent.

4. Question does NOT prescribe a unit (the result could be given in metres, kilometres, or a km+ m mix).  
   • Candidate 1: “2018” with no unit.  
   • Candidate 2: “2 km and 18 m”.  
   Because multiple reasonable units exist here, the omission of a unit in Candidate 1 creates ambiguity (Rule 1). Therefore the two answers to sub-problem 4 are not unambiguously the same.

5. Similarly, the multiplication result could be expressed in metres or in km+ m.  
   Candidate 1 gives “1000600” with no unit, Candidate 2 gives “1000 km and 600 m”. Again, unit omission in Candidate 1 makes the answer ambiguous when several units are plausible.

Since at least one sub-answer (actually two) is ambiguous/inequivalent, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates provide five answers, matching the five sub-questions.

Compare each sub-answer:

1. 6 (implicit pints) vs. 6 pints  → same value and unit.
2. 6 (implicit cups) vs. 6 cups  → same.
3. 25 000 (implicit meters) vs. 25 000 meters  → same.
4. 2 018 (implicit meters) vs. 2 018 meters  → same.
5. 1 000 600 (implicit meters) vs. 1000 km and 600 m  
   • 1000 km + 600 m = 1 000 600 m, matching the first value.  
   • Units are convertible and unambiguous, so they represent the same quantity.

Every corresponding answer is equivalent; no discrepancies exist.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates answer all five sub-questions.

Sub-Q1: C1 “6” vs. C2 “6 pints”. Question asks for pints; “6” unambiguously means 6 pints → equal.

Sub-Q2: C1 “6” vs. C2 “6 cups”. Question asks for cups; “6” clearly cups → equal.

Sub-Q3: C1 “25,000” vs. C2 “25000 meters”. Question asks meters; numeric values identical → equal.

Sub-Q4: C1 “2,018” vs. C2 “2018 meters”. Same numeric value; meters implied → equal.

Sub-Q5: C1 “1,000,600” vs. C2 “1000 km and 600 m” ( = 1,000,600 m). Values match → equal.

Thus every sub-answer is the same; omission of units in Candidate 1 does not introduce ambiguity because each question specifies a single expected unit.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give identical formulas for A(t) and C(t) and the same exact values (121π/4 for area, 11π for circumference).  
However, the question also requests approximate numerical values.  
Comparing those numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

Area at t=3 h  
• Candidate 1: 95.033178 (from 95.03317777)  
• Candidate 2: 95.030000 (from 95.03)  
They differ at the 5th significant digit.

Circumference at t=3 h  
• Candidate 1: 34.557519  
• Candidate 2: 34.560000  
They differ at the 4th significant digit.

Since the approximate values do not match to 6 significant digits, the answers are not equivalent according to Rule 4.
Both candidates give identical expressions for  

• the area function A(t)  
• the circumference function C(t)  
• the exact area at t = 3 (121 π⁄4)  
• the exact circumference at t = 3 (11 π)

However, for the required approximate numerical values:

• Candidate 1: area ≈ 95.033178  Candidate 2: area ≈ 95.030000  
• Candidate 1: circumference ≈ 34.557519 Candidate 2: circumference ≈ 34.560000  

Comparing each pair to 6 significant digits (Rule 4), the values do not match; they differ in the 4th–6th significant digits. Because the problem explicitly asks for these approximate numbers and the two candidates provide non-matching numerical results, the answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates give the same formulas and the same exact values, but their approximate numerical answers differ beyond the 6-significant-digit criterion required by Rule 4:

• Area at 3 h:  
  – C1 ≈ 95.033178 (95.0332 to 6 sig. fig.)  
  – C2 = 95.03 → 95.0300 to 6 sig. fig. (digits differ)

• Circumference at 3 h:  
  – C1 ≈ 34.557519 (34.5575 to 6 sig. fig.)  
  – C2 = 34.56 → 34.5600 to 6 sig. fig. (digits differ)

Since at least one required sub-answer (the approximate values) is not identical to 6 significant digits, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates convey that the system has no (unique) solution:

• Candidate 1 states the child’s ticket is “None” and the adult’s ticket is “None,” i.e., no prices exist.

• Candidate 2 simply answers “None,” which is exactly what the prompt instructs if there is no solution or infinitely many solutions.

Thus they express the same outcome; the slight difference in format does not alter the meaning. They are equivalent.

The two candidates give the same set of solutions.

• Candidate 1: \(x=\pi n\) (standard notation implicitly means \(n\) is an integer).

• Candidate 2: \(x=n\pi,\; n\in\mathbb{Z}\).

Re-ordering the factors (π n vs n π) makes no difference, and the only additional detail in Candidate 2 is the explicit statement \(n\in\mathbb{Z}\), which is the usual implicit meaning of the parameter \(n\) in Candidate 1. Thus the answers are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates express the solution set as all integer multiples of π:

• Candidate 1:  x = π·n  
• Candidate 2:  x = nπ, n ∈ ℤ

These denote exactly the same set {…, −2π, −π, 0, π, 2π, …}. Hence the answers are equivalent.

The two candidates are not clearly giving the same value:

• Candidate 1 states “maximum percentage error is: 0.1” (no percent sign).  
   Since it is labelled as a “percentage,” the most literal reading is 0.1 % (i.e., 0.001 as a fraction).

• Candidate 2 explicitly gives 10 %.

Because the missing unit in Candidate 1 creates ambiguity (0.1 could mean 0.1 % or 10 %), and the explicit value in Candidate 2 is 10 %, the answers cannot be considered unequivocally the same. Under Rule 1, such ambiguity makes them inequivalent.

The two antiderivatives differ in the logarithm’s denominator:

• Candidate 1: ln ((1 + √(1 − x²)) / |x|)  
• Candidate 2: ln ((1 + √(1 − x²)) / x)

When x > 0, |x| = x, so the two expressions coincide up to an additive constant.  
For x < 0, however, ln((1+√(1−x²))/x) is not real-valued, whereas ln((1+√(1−x²))/|x|) remains well-defined (still real). Thus Candidate 2 is valid only on x > 0, while Candidate 1 works on both sides (x ≠ 0 within (−1,1)).

Because their domains (and therefore the antiderivatives) are not the same, the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives differ by the presence of an absolute value around x inside the logarithm.

Candidate 1: ln((1 + √(1 − x²))/|x|) + C  
Candidate 2: ln((1 + √(1 − x²))/x) + C

• When x > 0, |x| = x, so the two expressions coincide.  
• When x < 0, the argument of Candidate 2’s logarithm is negative, so the expression is not real-valued, whereas Candidate 1 remains real. Moreover, on the interval (–1, 0) the difference between the two expressions is ln(sign x) = ln(–1) = iπ, which is not the same constant as on (0, 1). Hence the two candidates are not the same real antiderivative on the whole domain (–1, 1) \ {0}.

Because they do not give identical values (or even both remain real) on all parts of the domain, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both answers are antiderivatives of the same integrand, so they are equivalent if they differ only by a constant.

Candidate 1:  
C₁(x)= (x−2)/(2(8+2(x−2)²)) + (1/8) arctan((x−2)/2) − 1/(2(x²−4x+8)) + C  
Note 8+2(x−2)² = 2(x²−4x+8), hence  
(2(8+2(x−2)²)) = 4(x²−4x+8).  
Therefore  

 (x−2)/(2(8+2(x−2)²)) = (x−2)/(4(x²−4x+8)).  

Combine the two rational terms:  

 (x−2)/(4(x²−4x+8)) − 1/(2(x²−4x+8))  
 = (x−2)/(4(...)) − 2/(4(...))  
 = (x−4)/(4(x²−4x+8)).

Thus  
C₁(x)= (x−4)/(4(x²−4x+8)) + (1/8) arctan((x−2)/2) + C.

Candidate 2 already gives  

C₂(x)= (x−4)/(4(x²−4x+8)) + (1/8) arctan((x−2)/2) + C.

C₁(x) and C₂(x) are identical up to the arbitrary constant of integration, hence they are equivalent.

The problem asks for “the lengths of the sides” (plural).  
That requires specifying both side lengths (even if they turn out to be equal).

• Candidate 1 explicitly gives two side lengths: length = 2x + 3 and width = 2x + 3.  
• Candidate 2 only states “(2x + 3) meters,” giving just one length and not indicating that there are two identical sides.

Under Rule 2, when multiple answers are required and one candidate supplies fewer answers than the other, the responses are not equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by rewriting cot(4x)=1/tan(4x) and by simple algebra:

Candidate 1 inside the brackets:
  3/(2 cot²)+3/(4 cot⁴)+1/(6 cot⁶)−ln|cot|
= (3/2) tan²+(3/4) tan⁴+(1/6) tan⁶+ln|tan|.

Multiplying by the outside factor 3/2 gives
  (3/2) ln|tan| + (9/4) tan² + (9/8) tan⁴ + (1/4) tan⁶,
which is exactly Candidate 2 (up to the arbitrary constant of integration).

Hence the two expressions are mathematically identical antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Candidate 1 uses the symbol n, Candidate 2 uses k and explicitly says “for all integers k,” but this is the usual interpretation of n in Candidate 1 as well. Hence the two answers describe the identical set of x-values.

The two candidates agree on items 1 through 8, but for item 9 (point of inflection) they differ in the \(y\)-coordinate:

• Candidate 2: \(y = \sqrt{6/\sqrt[3]{2}}\) → 6‐sig-digit value: 2.182247

Since 2.182200 and 2.182247 are not identical to 6 significant digits (Rule 4), the answers are not equivalent.

The natural domain of the parameter is t > 0 (because ln t is defined only for positive t).

• Candidate 1 states:
  – concave up on (0, ∞)  (OK for the valid domain)  
  – adds concavity claims on (−∞, −½) and (−½, 0), which lie outside the domain and are thus meaningless/incorrect extra information.

• Candidate 2 states:
  – the curve is concave up for all t > 0, matching the valid domain and giving no additional (invalid) claims.

Because Candidate 1 supplies additional concavity intervals for parameter values where the curve is not even defined, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives of the same indefinite integral, so any two correct expressions may differ by an additive constant.

1.  Candidate 2:  
   F₂(x)=−1/(20 sin⁸(4x))+1/(15 sin⁶(4x))+C

   dF₂/dx = (8/5) cos³(4x)/sin⁹(4x), which is exactly the integrand (after simplifying cos(−4x), sin(−4x)).

2.  Candidate 1:  
   F₁(x)=C−(2/5)[(1/3)cot⁶(4x)+(1/4)cot⁴(4x)+(1/8)cot⁸(4x)]

   Rewrite the bracket in terms of csc powers:
      (1/3)cot⁶+(1/4)cot⁴+(1/8)cot⁸
      = (1/8)csc⁸ − (1/6)csc⁶ + 1/24.

   Hence  
   F₁(x)=C − [1/20 csc⁸(4x) − 1/15 csc⁶(4x) + 1/60]  
        = (C−1/60) − 1/(20 sin⁸(4x)) + 1/(15 sin⁶(4x)).

   This is exactly F₂(x) plus a constant shift of −1/60, which is irrelevant for an indefinite integral.

Since the two expressions differ only by a constant, they are mathematically equivalent antiderivatives.

The two antiderivatives differ by  
 Δ(x) = (3/4) √(5x² − 2x + 1) (1/x − 1/|x|).

• For x > 0, 1/x = 1/|x|, so Δ(x)=0 and the two expressions coincide.  
• For x < 0, 1/x = −1/|x|, so Δ(x)= −(3/2) √(5x² − 2x + 1)/|x|, which depends on x and is **not** a constant.

Because an indefinite integral may differ only by an additive constant, the candidates are not equivalent on the whole real domain (they agree only on x > 0). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give an antiderivative expressed in different but algebraically equivalent forms.

Let w = 1 + 9/x².

Candidate 1:  
F₁ = √w [ (2/1215) w² – (1/729) w – (1/1701) w³ ] + C.

Candidate 2 (rewrite):  
F₂ = –(x²+9)^{7/2}/(1701 x⁷)+2(x²+9)^{5/2}/(1215 x⁵)–(x²+9)^{3/2}/(729 x³)+C  
  = √w w [ –(1/1701) w² + (2/1215) w – (1/729) ] + C  
  = √w [ –(1/1701) w³ + (2/1215) w² – (1/729) w ] + C.

The factor inside the brackets of F₂ is identical to that in F₁:

 –(1/1701) w³ + (2/1215) w² – (1/729) w.

Hence F₁ = F₂ + constant, so the two antiderivatives are the same (difference at most by an additive constant).

Therefore the two candidate answers are equivalent.

The expressions are not identical.

• For the x–coordinates, both candidates give  
  sqrt(4/(1+m²)) = 2/√(1+m²).  
 So the x–coordinates match.

• For the y–coordinates:  
 Candidate 1 has √(4 m²/(1+m²)) = 2 |m|/√(1+m²).  
 Candidate 2 has 2 m/√(1+m²).

 Because √(m²) equals |m|, Candidate 1’s y–coordinate is 2 |m|/√(1+m²), whereas Candidate 2’s is 2 m/√(1+m²).  
 For negative m these differ in sign, so Candidate 1’s points do not satisfy y = m x when m < 0.

Hence Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are equivalent only for m ≥ 0, but not in general. Since the question did not restrict m, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Thus the x–coordinates match, but the y–coordinates differ whenever m < 0 because |m| = −m in that case.  
For negative m, Candidate 1’s y–values have the opposite sign from those in Candidate 2, so the sets of points are different.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives can be rewritten in the same variables.

Let s = sin(2x).

Candidate 1 gives  
F₁(x)= ½[(1/3)s³ + s − ½ ln| (1+s)/(s−1) |] + C  
   = 1/6 s³ + ½ s − ¼ ln|1+s| + ¼ ln|1−s| + C.

Candidate 2 gives  
F₂(x)= 1/6 s³ + ½ s − ½ ln|sec(2x)+tan(2x)| + C.

Since sec θ + tan θ = (1 + sin θ)/cos θ, we have  

ln|sec θ + tan θ| = ln|1 + s| − ln|cos θ|,  
and |cos θ| = √(1 − s²) ⇒ ln|cos θ| = ½[ln|1+s| + ln|1−s|].

Therefore  
−½ ln|sec θ + tan θ|  
= −½[ln|1+s| − ln|cos θ|]  
= −½ ln|1+s| + ½·½[ln|1+s| + ln|1−s|]  
= −¼ ln|1+s| + ¼ ln|1−s|,

which makes

F₂(x)= 1/6 s³ + ½ s − ¼ ln|1+s| + ¼ ln|1−s| + C,

identical to F₁(x) up to an overall constant.

Hence the two candidates provide equivalent antiderivatives.

The two antiderivatives differ only in the logarithmic term.

Candidate 2 has  
(1/4) ln| sin x + cos x |.

Candidate 1 rewrites sin x + cos x as cos x (1+tan x) and gives  
(1/4)[ln(1+tan x)+ln|cos x|].

Because sin x + cos x = cos x(1+tan x), we need

 ln| cos x | + ln| 1+tan x | = ln| sin x + cos x |.

Candidate 1 omits the absolute value on (1+tan x).  Hence on intervals where 1+tan x > 0 the two expressions coincide, but on intervals where 1+tan x < 0, Candidate 1’s logarithm is undefined in the real domain, whereas Candidate 2’s expression remains real.  This is not merely a constant difference; it is a domain difference.

Therefore the two answers are not fully equivalent as real antiderivatives of the given integrand.

The two candidates give different multiplicative factors in front of the common fourth–root expression.

Rewrite the desired derivative in logarithmic form:

y = x^{5/4}(5x^2+1)^{1/4}(2+3x)^{-1/12}

⇒ y'/y = ¼[5/x + 10x/(5x^2+1) – 1/(2+3x)].

Thus the correct factor multiplying y is

(1/4)( 5/x + 10x/(5x^2+1) – 1/(2+3x) ),

which is exactly Candidate 2’s prefactor.

Candidate 1’s prefactor is

(50x³ + 35x² + 14x + 10) / (30x⁴ + 20x³ + 12x² + 8x),

which is not algebraically equal to the expression above (e.g. at x = 1 it gives 109/70 ≈ 1.5571, whereas Candidate 2’s gives 1.6167).  

Since the multiplicative factors differ, the two derivatives are not the same.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of the integrand in the form  

  (6x)^{2/3} − 5(6x)^{1/3} + 5 ln(1 + (6x)^{1/3}) − 6 arctan((6x)^{1/6}) + C ,

just written with slightly different notation:

• Candidate 1 writes (√[6]{6x})⁴ = (6x)^{2/3}, −5 (√[6]{6x})² = −5 (6x)^{1/3}, 5 ln|1 + (√[6]{6x})²| = 5 ln|1 + (6x)^{1/3}|, and −6 arctan(√[6]{6x}).  
• Candidate 2 writes (√[3]{6x})² = (6x)^{2/3}, −5 √[3]{6x} = −5 (6x)^{1/3}, 5 ln(√[3]{6x}+1) = 5 ln(1 + (6x)^{1/3}), and −6 arctan(√[6]{6x}).

The only difference is that Candidate 1 places an absolute-value bar inside the logarithm, which changes the antiderivative only by an (at most piece-wise) constant and thus does not affect its derivative. Hence the two expressions differ at most by an additive constant, which is allowed for indefinite integrals.

Therefore the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

up to the customary constant of integration.  
Candidate 1 writes the logarithm with an absolute value, candidate 2 without; this difference affects only an additive constant and is immaterial for an indefinite integral. Otherwise the two expressions are algebraically identical.

Both answers describe the same set of x-values.

Candidate 1: union of closed intervals  
  [−π/6 + 2πk, 7π/6 + 2πk] for every integer k.

Candidate 2: real line with the open gaps  
  (7π/6 + 2πk, 11π/6 + 2πk) removed; i.e. keep every point outside those gaps.

For each k, the interval kept by candidate 2 from 11π/6 + 2πk to 7π/6 + 2π(k+1) (endpoints included) is exactly the interval given by candidate 1 with index k+1, while the interval kept by candidate 2 from −π/6 + 2πk to 7π/6 + 2πk coincides with the interval given by candidate 1 with index k. Hence their unions coincide, and the endpoints  −π/6 + 2πk, 7π/6 + 2πk, 11π/6 + 2πk are all included in both descriptions.

Thus the two candidate domains are mathematically identical.

Both candidates describe the same subset of ℝ.

Candidate 1: for each k ∈ ℤ the allowed x satisfy  
 −π/6 + 2πk ≤ x ≤ 7π/6 + 2πk.

Candidate 2: remove from ℝ the open intervals (7π/6 + 2πk, 11π/6 + 2πk).  
The remaining set is the whole real line except where sin x < −1/2; equivalently it is
 [−π/6 + 2πk, 7π/6 + 2πk] ∪ {the single point 11π/6 + 2πk}
which is exactly Candidate 1’s closed interval once one notes that
 11π/6 + 2πk = −π/6 + 2π(k+1),
so those endpoints coincide period-by-period.

Thus the two descriptions define identical domains.

The two candidates describe the same infinite set of zeros.

Mapping candidate 1’s families to candidate 2’s:

1.  −π/2 + 2πn  ≡  3π/2 + 2π(n−1) → candidate 2’s 3π/2 + 2πk  
2.  −2π/3 + 2πn ≡ 4π/3 + 2π(n−1) → candidate 2’s 4π/3 + 2πk  
3.  2π/3 + 2πn          → candidate 2’s 2π/3 + 2πk  
4.  (−1)^n · π/6 + πn gives:  
  • n even ⇒ π/6 + 2πm  → candidate 2’s π/6 + 2πk  
  • n odd  ⇒ 5π/6 + 2πm → candidate 2’s 5π/6 + 2πk  

Thus every solution family in one candidate matches exactly a family in the other, with no extras or omissions. The differing counts (4 vs. 5 listed families) are only due to candidate 1 combining π/6 and 5π/6 into a single formula.

The two expressions match term-by-term except for the logarithm:

• Candidate 1: 3 ln |x+4+√(x²+8x)|
• Candidate 2: 3 ln ( x+4+√(x²+8x) )

Because √(x²+8x) is real for x ≤ –8 or x ≥ 0.  
For x ≤ –8 the quantity (x+4+√(x²+8x)) is negative, so the absolute-value bars in Candidate 1 are essential to keep the result real; Candidate 2 omits them and is undefined (or complex) on that portion of the domain.

Thus the two antiderivatives are not equivalent on the full domain of the integrand.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give

Candidate 1:   (2x + 1) √(x² + 8x) + 3 ln|x + 4 + √(x² + 8x)| + C  
Candidate 2:   (2x + 1) √(x² + 8x) + 3 ln(x + 4 + √(x² + 8x)) + C

The only difference is the absolute–value bars around the logarithm’s argument.

• For x ≥ 0 the argument x + 4 + √(x² + 8x) is positive, so ln|…| = ln(…) and the two expressions coincide.

• For x ≤ –8 the integrand is still real (the square root is defined), but the argument of the logarithm is negative.  
 – Candidate 1 remains real-valued because ln|…| is defined.  
 – Candidate 2 becomes ln(negative number), which is not defined in the real domain.

Thus Candidate 2 fails to represent a real antiderivative on part of the domain where the integral itself is real, whereas Candidate 1 is valid everywhere the integrand is.

Therefore the two answers are not mathematically equivalent.

The two candidates both state the volume as \(\dfrac{25}{3}\,\pi\).  
Candidate 1 writes it as \(\pi\cdot\frac{25}{3}\); Candidate 2 writes it as \(\dfrac{25}{3}\pi\). Since multiplication is commutative, these are the same numerical value with the same (implicit) units.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by the constant \( \tfrac{1}{126}\):

• Candidate 1  
 \(F_1(x)=\dfrac{1}{42}\cot^{4}(10x)+\dfrac{1}{63}\cot^{6}(10x)\)  
   = \(\dfrac{1}{63\sin^{6}(10x)}-\dfrac{1}{42\sin^{4}(10x)}+\dfrac{1}{126}\)

• Candidate 2  
 \(F_2(x)=\dfrac{1}{63\sin^{6}(-10x)}-\dfrac{1}{42\sin^{4}(-10x)}\)  
   = \( \dfrac{1}{63\sin^{6}(10x)}-\dfrac{1}{42\sin^{4}(10x)}\)

Thus \(F_1(x)=F_2(x)+\dfrac{1}{126}\).  
Because indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant, the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Both antiderivatives can be rewritten to the same form.

Candidate 1:
1. 1/ sin x = csc x  
2. (3/4)[ln|sin x – 1| – ln|1 + sin x|] = –(3/4) ln| (1+sin x)/(1–sin x) |  
3. sin x / [2( sin²x – 1)] = – sin x /(2 cos²x) = –(1/2) sec x tan x  

Thus candidate 1 becomes  
csc x – (3/4) ln|(1+sin x)/(1–sin x)| – (1/2) sec x tan x + C.

This is exactly Candidate 2.

Therefore the two answers differ only by an (implicit) constant of integration and are equivalent.

Both answers give an explicit Fourier series, but

1. Argument of the trigonometric terms  
   • Candidate 1 uses cos(n x) and sin(n x) → fundamental period 2π.  
   • Candidate 2 uses cos(n x / 2) and sin(n x / 2) → fundamental period 4π.

   The two sets of basis functions are different; one cannot map term-by-term with the same indexing.

2. Coefficients  
   Even after trying to re-index (e.g. letting n′=2n in Candidate 2 to match cos(n x)), the coefficients do not match: denominators become (n²+4) in Candidate 2 versus (n²+16) (and an extra factor (–1)ⁿ) in Candidate 1.  The sine coefficients also differ by a factor 2.

Because the basis functions and their coefficients do not coincide, the two series are not the same expansion. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single Fourier‐series expression, but the trigonometric arguments are different:

• Candidate 1 uses cos(n x) and sin(n x).  
• Candidate 2 uses cos(n x / 2) and sin(n x / 2).

Since x and x / 2 differ by a factor 2, the two series represent different sets of basis functions (different frequencies). The coefficients are otherwise the same constant factors, but the change in argument cannot be removed by any simple re-indexing; Candidate 2 contains terms that do not appear in Candidate 1 and vice-versa. Therefore the two series are not algebraically identical and do not represent the same Fourier expansion.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The quadratic equation has two distinct solutions.  

• Candidate 1 provides two solutions: 2 + i and –1 + i.  
• Candidate 2 provides only one solution: –1 + i.

Because the question requires all solutions and Candidate 2 gives fewer answers than required, the two candidates’ responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates supply answers for all three required sub-questions, so we compare each corresponding answer.

1. Formula: both give C(t) = 10.25 t + 20 → identical.

2. Cost for 2 days 7 hours: both give \$583.75 → identical.

3. Rental time for \$432.73:  
   • Candidate 1: 40.26634146 h  
   • Candidate 2: 40.266 h  

   Convert each to 6 significant digits:  
   • Candidate 1 → 40.2663  
   • Candidate 2 → 40.2660 (40.266 with trailing zeros)  

   They differ at the 6th significant digit (3 vs 0). Rule 4 requires exact agreement to 6 significant digits; thus the two answers for part 3 are not equivalent.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant.  
Evaluating them at two different admissible points, e.g. x = 0 and x = 5, shows that the numerical differences between Candidate 2 and Candidate 1 are not equal (≈ 2.36 at x = 0 and ≈ 11.8 at x = 5).  
Hence the expressions cannot differ only by a constant and are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivative expressions are very different:  

• Both contain the same logarithmic term (with coefficient 2), but  
• Candidate 1 has  –3 · arcsin( … )  
• Candidate 2 has  +6 · arctan( … )

An arcsin of one argument is generally not convertible to an arctan of a completely different argument by adding only a constant; they are genuinely different functions of x. Therefore the two antiderivatives cannot differ merely by an additive constant, so they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give explicit antiderivative formulas, but

F₁(x) = 2 ln|x–2+√(x²–4x+2)| – 3 arcsin[ x /((x–1)√2) ] + C  
F₂(x) = 2 ln|x–1+√(x²–4x+2)| + C.

Their difference is  

F₁ – F₂ = 2 ln|x–2+√…| – 2 ln|x–1+√…| – 3 arcsin[ x /((x–1)√2) ] ,

which clearly contains the variable-dependent arcsin term and a non-constant logarithmic ratio, so it cannot reduce to a mere constant. Therefore the two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant, hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by algebraic rearrangement:

• Candidate 1 simplifies to  
 (1/5) cot csc⁴ + (4/15) cot csc² + (8/15) cot + C  
 = cot + (2/3) cot³ + (1/5) cot⁵ + C.

Thus the two expressions are the same up to an additive constant (allowed for indefinite integrals).

• Candidate 1: κ = 1 / [48 · |sin(t/2)|]

Because sin(t/2) can take negative values for some values of t, omitting the absolute value changes the sign of the expression, whereas curvature should be non-negative. Hence the two candidates are not mathematically equivalent in general.

Both candidates list two infinite families of zeros, each described modulo π.

1. Family with arctan(1/2):  
   • Candidate 1:  x = arctan(1/2) + π n  
   • Candidate 2:  x = arctan(1/2) + π k  
   These are identical (just a different symbol for the integer).

2. Second family:  
   • Candidate 1:  x = −π/4 + π n  
   • Candidate 2:  x = 3π/4 + π k  

   Observe that 3π/4 = −π/4 + π.  Shifting the integer index (let k = n − 1) shows the two forms generate exactly the same set of numbers. Hence the two families coincide.

Since each candidate supplies the same two solution sets (just expressed with different but equivalent phase shifts), the overall answer sets are the same.

Both candidates describe the region D in polar coordinates with

 r-range: 0 ≤ r ≤ 4 cos θ

and differ only in the θ-interval they choose:

• Candidate 1: 3π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 5π/2  
 (This is exactly the set of angles where cos θ ≥ 0, written as one continuous interval that wraps past 2π.)

• Candidate 2: 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π  
 (For θ where cos θ < 0, the upper bound 4 cos θ becomes negative, so no r satisfies 0 ≤ r ≤ 4 cos θ; hence those θ contribute no points, leaving the same geometric region.)

Because polar coordinates are non-unique (adding 2π to θ gives the same point), both descriptions generate exactly the same subset of ℝ², namely the circle x² + y² ≤ 4x.

Thus the two answers are equivalent.
Both candidates give  
• the same radial bound: 0 ≤ r ≤ 4 cos θ  
• angular values that cover exactly those θ for which cos θ ≥ 0.

Candidate 2 lists them as two sub-intervals inside 0-2π:  
 [0, π/2] ∪ [3π/2, 2π].

Candidate 1 uses one continuous interval shifted by 2π:  
 [3π/2, 5π/2] = [3π/2, 2π] ∪ [2π, 5π/2]  
which, modulo 2π, is the same set of directions. Thus both describe the same set of (x,y) points (the same region D), the only difference being redundant θ values in Candidate 1.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for TWO components: the tangential component \(a_t\) and the normal component \(a_N\).

• Candidate 1 supplies both:
  – \(a_t = 0\)
  – \(a_N = \omega^{2}\,|a|\)

• Candidate 2 gives only one expression: “\(a \omega^{2}\)”, with no separate tangential component.

Since Candidate 2 omits a required answer, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates differ in the expression for the normal component of the acceleration:

• Candidate 1: \(a_N = \omega^{2}\,|a|\)  
• Candidate 2: \(a_N = a\,\omega^{2}\)

Candidate 1 uses an absolute value, ensuring the magnitude is non-negative; Candidate 2 does not. Unless it is explicitly given that \(a\) is always non-negative, the two formulas can yield different values (opposite sign) when \(a<0\). Because the question does not state that \(a\) must be positive, the answers cannot be guaranteed to coincide in all cases.

Therefore, the candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:  (1/4) ln((1+x)/(1−x)) + (1/2) arctan x

For the domain where the series actually converges (|x|<1), both 1+x and 1−x are positive, so |x+1| / |x−1| = (1+x)/(1−x). Therefore the logarithmic parts coincide, and the arctan terms are identical. Hence the two expressions represent the same function on the relevant domain.

Thus the two answers are equivalent.

Both answers give a single formula for d²y/dx².

1.  Put sin t = s, cos t = c.  
   Candidate 2:  −(s² + 2c⁴)/(9216 s⁵ c³).

2.  Candidate 1 numerator  
   (2304 s³ − 1536 s)(c² − s²) − 1536 s²c·(2sc)  
   = −768 s³c² − 1536 s c² − 2304 s⁵ + 1536 s³  
   = 768[−s³c² − 2s c² − 3s⁵ + 2s³]  
   = 768[−s(s² + 2c⁴)]        (after using c² = 1 − s²).

3.  Candidate 1 denominator   
   7 077 888 c³ s⁶ = 27·2¹⁸ c³ s⁶ = 768 · 9216 c³ s⁶  
   = 768 (9216 s⁵ c³).

4.  Hence Candidate 1 value  
   = [768 (−s(s² + 2c⁴))]/[768 s·(9216 s⁵ c³)]  
   = −(s² + 2c⁴)/(9216 s⁵ c³).

This is exactly the expression given by Candidate 2. Therefore the two candidates are mathematically identical.

The question has 5 separate sub-problems, each expecting a numerical value with an associated unit (or an unambiguous implied unit).

Sub-answers comparison:

1. 4 (no unit) vs 4 lbs – likely equivalent (only sensible unit is lbs).
2. 4 (no unit) vs 4 quarts – likely equivalent (only sensible unit is quarts).
3. 4 (no unit) vs 4 pints – likely equivalent (only sensible unit is pints).
4. 6 000 (unit omitted) vs 6 metric tons – ambiguous: 6 000 could be kg, metric tons, etc. Because the question allows both kg or metric-ton answers, omission of the unit introduces ambiguity (Rule 1). Thus the two responses for this sub-problem are not guaranteed to match.
5. 10.25 (unit omitted) vs 10 lb 4 oz – again an ambiguity similar to #4 (10.25 might be pounds, kilograms, etc.).

Since at least one sub-answer (#4, and arguably #5) is ambiguous due to missing units, the two candidate outputs cannot be certified as matching on every required answer (Rule 2 combined with Rule 1). Therefore the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

The numeric value of Candidate 1 is  
ln(0.15)/(-0.28) ≈ 6.77543.

Candidate 2 states 6.78, which—interpreting missing digits as zeros—corresponds to 6.78000.

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):  
6.77543 ≠ 6.78000.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
The numerical value of Candidate 1:

x = ln(0.15)/(-0.28)  
ln(0.15) ≈ –1.89712  
x ≈ (–1.89712)/(–0.28) ≈ 6.77543

Expressed to six significant digits: 6.77543

Candidate 2 states: 6.78 → 6.78000 to six significant digits.

Comparing 6.77543 and 6.78000, they differ beginning at the third decimal place, so they are not identical to six significant digits (Rule 4). Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply an explicit antiderivative of  

∫ dx /[(x+4)√(x²+2x+5)].

Let  

A = √(x² + 2x + 5) and U = x + 4 + A – √13.  

Candidate 2 gives  

(1/√13) ln| U / (U + 2√13) | + C.          (1)

Candidate 1 gives  

(1/√13) [ ln(√13 – 4 – x – A) − ln(4 + √13 + x + A ) ] + C  
        = (1/√13) ln[ −U / (U + 2√13) ] + C.      (2)

Because −U differs from U only by the factor −1, (2) can be rewritten

(1/√13) ln| U / (U + 2√13) | + (1/√13) ln|−1| + C  
= (1/√13) ln| U / (U + 2√13) | + C′,

where C′ = C + (1/√13) ln|−1| is just another integration constant, independent of x.

Hence the two antiderivatives differ only by an additive constant, so they represent the same family of primitives of the given integrand. The absence of explicit absolute-value bars in Candidate 1 does not change this conclusion, since adding them merely adds a (possible) constant term.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives differ only by an additive constant.

Starting from Candidate 1, combine its two logarithms:

F₁(x)= (1/√13) ln [(√13−4−x−√(x²+2x+5)) / (4+√13+x+√(x²+2x+5))].

Let S = √(x²+2x+5).  Define  

A = √13 − 4 − x − S,  
B = 4 + √13 + x + S,  
D = √13 S − 3x + 1.

One finds algebraically (or by checking two different numerical values of x) that

A/B = −(√13 − 3)·(x+4)/D,

so

F₁(x) = (1/√13)[ln(x+4) − ln D + ln(−(√13−3))]  
      = (1/√13)[ln(x+4) − ln D] + constant.

Candidate 2 is

F₂(x)= (1/√13)[ln|x+4| − ln|D|] + C.

Hence F₁(x) = F₂(x) + (1/√13) ln|−(√13−3)|, i.e. they differ only by an additive constant.  
Since indefinite integrals that differ by a constant are equivalent, the two candidates give the same antiderivative.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant.

Let t = x/3.

Candidate 1 term involving trig functions:
−3 sin³t / cos t  − (9/4) sin 2t.

Candidate 2 term involving trig functions:
−3 tan t  − (3/4) sin 2t.

Compare the −3 coefficients:
tan t − sin³t / cos t = (sin t / cos t) − (sin³ t / cos t) = sin t cos t
= (1/2) sin 2t.

Hence
−3 tan t + 3 sin³t / cos t = −3 (−sin t cos t) = 3 sin t cos t
= (3/2) sin 2t.

So the difference between the two candidates’ entire expressions is

(3/2) sin 2t  − (3/2) sin 2t = 0,

i.e. they differ only by a constant C.

Therefore the two antiderivatives are equivalent.

The question implicitly has two sub-tasks:  
(a) list the point(s) where the tangent is horizontal,  
(b) list the point(s) where the tangent is vertical.  

Candidate 1 gives two separate answers, explicitly labeling which points correspond to horizontal and which to vertical tangents.  

Candidate 2 merely lists the three points without specifying which belong to which category. Hence Candidate 2 omits a required component of the answer for each sub-task.  

By Rule 2 (multiple-answer questions: each candidate must supply every required sub-answer), the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both answers give  
½ cot⁴(11x) – cot²(11x) plus a logarithmic term and a constant.

Candidate 1’s logarithmic term:
 ln(1+cot²(11x))

Since 1+cot²θ = csc²θ = 1/sin²θ,  
ln(1+cot²θ) = ln(csc²θ) = ln(1/sin²θ) = –2 ln|sin θ|.

Thus  
ln(1+cot²(11x)) = –2 ln|sin(11x)|,

which is exactly the logarithmic term appearing (with the same sign) in Candidate 2.

All the remaining algebraic terms (½ cot⁴ and – cot²) are identical in both candidates, and any difference can be absorbed into the integration constant C.

Therefore the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by an overall constant and are mathematically identical.

Both antiderivatives can be rewritten with u = x + 5:

Candidate 1  
F₁(u)=5u+((1/2)u²−5u)ln u−(1/4)u²+D

Candidate 2  
x=u−5, x²=(u−5)²=u²−10u+25  
F₂(u)=½(u²−10u+25)ln u−¼u²+5u−25/2 ln u+C  
   =½u² ln u−5u ln u+25/2 ln u−25/2 ln u−¼u²+5u+C  
   =½u² ln u−5u ln u−¼u²+5u+C

Thus
F₁(u)=½u² ln u−5u ln u−¼u²+5u+D  
F₂(u)=½u² ln u−5u ln u−¼u²+5u+C

They differ only by the arbitrary constants C and D. Hence the two results represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both candidates provide the same numerical probability:

• Candidate 1 lists it twice, as “1/4” and “25 %”, which are equivalent (0.25).  
• Candidate 2 gives “1/4”, i.e. 0.25.

Since the question requires a single probability value and both candidates ultimately give 0.25, their predictions are equivalent.

• Candidate 2: ⟨2 s_x⟩ = –sin[ω (t–t₀)]  (dimensionless—missing the ħ factor—and the frequency ω is not defined).

Because the first answer in each set is not the same (different overall magnitude/units and unspecified frequency in Candidate 2), the two candidates are not equivalent. The ⟨2 s_z⟩ answers match, but Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to agree.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers represent numerical probabilities.

• Candidate 1: 0.702 (interpreted as 0.702000 to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 512/729 ≈ 0.702332

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

0.702000 ≠ 0.702332

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

2) the expectation value ⟨sₓ⟩(t)

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give answers for these two items, but:

• Their spinors are not the same even up to an overall (global) phase:  
 ψ₁(t)=1/√2 (e^{-iωt}, i e^{-iωt})  
 ψ₂(t)=1/√2 (e^{-iωt/2}, i e^{+iωt/2})  
 No single phase factor converts one into the other.

• Their predicted ⟨sₓ⟩ differ:  
 Candidate 1: −(ħ/2) sin(2ωt)  
 Candidate 2: −(ħ/2) sin(ωt)

Since at least one of the required sub-answers is different, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both sub-problems must be answered.

• Candidate 1 supplies an explicit resonance condition ω = 2 μB_z/ℏ (part a) and a probability formula for part (b).

• Candidate 2 gives only one expression (a probability formula).  It never states the resonance value ω, so part (a) is missing.  (Rule 2: omission of a required answer → inequivalent.)

• Even comparing the probability formulas, the two expressions are algebraically different (different denominators, different oscillation frequency, different overall factor), so they do not match.

Because Candidate 2 lacks the answer to sub-problem (a) and the two probability results disagree, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give answers for all nine sub-parts, but their responses differ for sub-problem (i):

• Candidate 1:  ΔE = (1/8) α⁴ m c²  ≈ 1.8 × 10⁻⁴ eV  
• Candidate 2:  ΔE = e⁸ m / (ħ⁴ c²)  ≈ 10⁻⁴ eV  

Candidate 2’s formula lacks the factor 1/8 that appears in Candidate 1’s expression, so the two answers are not the same. Since at least one required sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

• Candidate 1: σₜ = 4 π a² [ tan(k₀ a)/(k₀ a) – 1 ]²  
• Candidate 2: σₜ = π [ a – (ħ tan(k₀ a))/√(2 m V₀) ]²

After inserting k₀ = √(2 m V₀)/ħ and simplifying, Candidate 1 becomes
 σ₁ = (2 π ħ² / m V₀) [ tan(k₀ a) – k₀ a ]²,

whereas Candidate 2 remains
 σ₂ = π [ a – (ħ tan(k₀ a))/k₀ ]².

These differ by both an overall prefactor and the dimensional factors inside the square; they are not algebraically the same, nor dimensionally consistent with each other. Therefore the two answers are inequivalent.

Both candidates give the same mathematical form: a prefactor πħ²/4 divided by (mass × R⁵).  

Candidate 1 writes the mass as μ, while Candidate 2 writes it as m.  
In the context of a single electron (no other body involved), whichever symbol is used represents the electron’s mass, so μ = m here.

Therefore the two expressions are equivalent.

The question has two sub-problems:  
(a) list all possible final n-values,  
(b) give the probability for the highest-energy one.

Candidate 1 supplies answers for both (a) and (b).  
Candidate 2 gives only a single formula (for a probability) and does not list the allowed n-values, so it fails to answer sub-problem (a).

Because one candidate omits a required answer, Rule 2 says the two predictions are not equivalent.  
(The actual probability formulas also differ in detail, confirming the inequivalence.)

The question has two sub-parts, (a) and (b).  
Both candidates give answers for both sub-parts, so we compare each:

(a) Hyperfine splitting  
• Candidate 1: ΔE = 4 ħ² a  
• Candidate 2: ΔE = 4 a  

These differ by the factor ħ², i.e. they are numerically and dimensionally different unless one redefines a, which neither candidate does. Hence the two answers are not the same.

Because Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to match, the discrepancy in part (a) already makes the overall answers inequivalent. (Even though their part-(b) descriptions are compatible, that cannot compensate for the mismatch in part (a).)

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates provide answers for all four sub-questions, but they differ for sub-question (c):

(a) Equivalent (difference only in notation |q| vs. e)  
(b) Equivalent  
(c) NOT equivalent – Candidate 1 gives a time-dependent sinusoidal expression with a sine factor, whereas Candidate 2 gives a constant value with no time dependence.  
(d) Equivalent (both scale as N²)

Because at least one sub-answer disagrees, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.

The question has four sub-parts (a)–(d), so every sub-answer given by the two candidates must match.  

• For (a), (b) and (d) the two expressions are essentially the same if we identify q with e and γ₁₂ with r₁₂; the only difference is an absolute value sign in (a), which doesn’t change the size of the parameter.  

• For sub-part (c) the expressions clearly differ:

 Candidate 1:  ⟨r⟩ = −(2 α q r₁₂²/ħ) sin[ω₀(t − t₁)]  
 Candidate 2:  ⟨−e r⟩ = (2 e² α |γ₁₂|²/ħ) sin(ω₀ t)

They differ in overall sign, contain different charge factors (q vs e²), and one has a phase shift t − t₁ while the other uses t. Because at least one sub-answer is different, the two candidates’ full sets of answers are not identical.

The two candidates give different results for the required quantities.

1. Part (a):  
   • Both give the same energy-eigenvalue formula and the same two-fermion ground-state energy.  
   • For the ground-state wavefunction(s), Candidate 1 lists BOTH displaced Gaussians (two degenerate states), whereas Candidate 2 writes only one of them. Thus Candidate 2 omits one required state.

2. Part (b):  
   • First-order energy shift: Candidate 1 gives  ΔE = ε e^{−λ²/(mħω³)}, while Candidate 2 gives  ΔE = −ε. These are plainly different.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give formulas that differ by overall factors of ħ and m.

General-n result  
• Candidate 1: contains ħ and m explicitly.  
• Candidate 2: omits ħ and m entirely.

n = 1 result  
• Candidate 1: E₀ ≤ (ħ/2) √(2λ/m) = ħ √(λ/(2m)).  
• Candidate 2: E₀ ≤ √(λ/2).

Thus Candidate 2’s expressions are those of Candidate 1 only after setting ħ = m = 1, a unit convention that is neither stated in the problem nor in the answer. Because the omission of these physical constants produces an ambiguity in the units (Rule 1), the two answers cannot be considered equivalent.

The two expressions are clearly different in structure, factors, and symbols.  Candidate 1 contains  
 • a factor ρ(E) (density of states)  
 • e²/(ħ² m² c²) and (k′·p_if)²  

whereas Candidate 2 contains  
 • (4 π a₀² α ω / c)(p/m)  
 • the matrix element |A₀·⟨p| r |g⟩|²  

There is no straightforward algebraic identity or unit rescaling that turns one expression into the other. Consequently, by Rule 1 (different essential factors/units) and Rule 8 (different required formula), the answers are not equivalent.

The question has two sub-parts.

Sub-part (a): both candidates describe the same variational/Rayleigh–quotient idea, so they match here.

Sub-part (b): each gives a numerical upper-bound coefficient multiplying \(T_0/(\mu_0 a^2)\).

• Candidate 1: 19.739 → written to at least five significant digits, i.e. 19.7390

• Candidate 2: 2π² ≈ 19.74 → to six significant digits that is 19.7392 (or, as the rounded number shown, 19.7400)

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

19.7390  ≠  19.7392  (difference at the 6th significant digit)

Therefore the numerical answers for part (b) are not identical to six-digit precision, so the two overall answers are not equivalent.

The question appears to require (at least) both the reflected/incident amplitude ratio A and the transmission coefficient T.

• Candidate 1 supplies two explicit expressions:  
  – answer 1: an expression for A  
  – answer 2: a specific, non-exponential formula for T in terms of γ.  

• Candidate 2 supplies only one quantity (T) and it is given in a different form, the usual simple WKB exponential, not matching Candidate 1’s algebraic expression.  

Hence:  
1. The number of answers differs (Candidate 2 omits A).  
2. Even for T, the formulas are not the same.  

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Sub-answers comparison (expressed to six significant digits):

Candidate 2:  m = m₀ √[(1 − v/c)/(1 + v/c)]

Since (c − v)/(c + v) = [c (1 − v/c)] / [c (1 + v/c)] = (1 − v/c)/(1 + v/c), the two formulas are algebraically identical. They use the same units and supply the single required answer.

The question asks for explicit answers to several sub-parts, including (b) a qualitative statement about where the bullet is located.  

• Both candidates give equivalent formulas for the force and potential (part (a)), identical turning-point radii (part (b)), the same differential‐angle formula (part (c)), and closely related orbit equations (part (d)).  

• However, part (b) also requires the statement “Is the bullet always in the cloud, outside the cloud, or sometimes inside and sometimes outside?”  
 – Candidate 2 explicitly answers: “The bullet is always inside the cloud.”  
 – Candidate 1 gives only the turning-point radii and never states this qualitative conclusion.

Because Candidate 1 omits a required component of part (b), the two sets of answers are not fully the same.

The question requires, for part (a), BOTH the equilibrium position and the period.  
Candidate 1 supplies only the period; the equilibrium position is entirely missing, whereas Candidate 2 gives it (x = –a).

For part (b) the ranges of velocity are different:

•  Candidate 2 lists three mutually exclusive ranges with explicit direction (positive/negative) tied to (1) oscillate, (2) escape to –∞, (3) escape to +∞.

•  Candidate 1 gives three inequalities without indicating which phenomenon each one corresponds to; in addition, the set “v > √(2c/ma)” is a subset of “v > √(c/ma),” so the three statements do not partition the possibilities as required and do not match Candidate 2’s ranges.

Because Candidate 1 omits a required answer (equilibrium position) and the velocity ranges do not match Candidate 2’s, the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both parts of the required answer contain several separate items, so we must compare every item in the two candidate responses.

Sub-problem (a)

1. Lorentz transformation of the position 4-vector:
   • C1 gives the standard boost matrix (x–ct mixing along the x–axis, γ on the diagonal, −βγ off-diagonal).  
   • C2 writes the same transformation in component form (ct′ = γ(ct − βx), x′ = γ(x − βct), y′ = y, z′ = z).  
   These are the same transformation written in two notations; no sign or factor discrepancy appears.

2. Transformation of the momentum 4-vector:
   • C1: (p′_x c, p′_y c, p′_z c, E′) = (γ(p_x c − βE), p_y c, p_z c, γ(E − βp_x c)).  
   • C2: E′/c = γ(E/c − βp_x), p′_x = γ(p_x − βE/c), p′_y = p_y, p′_z = p_z.  
   Multiplying C2’s first two equations by c shows they are identical to C1’s; the y and z components are likewise identical. Hence these transformations coincide.

Sub-problem (b): Relativistic Doppler formulas

Both candidates list all three required cases and give exactly the same expressions:

i) ν = ν₀ √[(1+β)/(1−β)] (approaching)  
ii) ν = ν₀ √[(1−β)/(1+β)] (receding)  
iii) ν = ν₀/√(1−β²) (transverse case)

Notation differences (β vs. β₀) do not change the formula.

All requested components are present in both candidates and are algebraically identical. Therefore, the two candidate answers are equivalent.

The essential point to compare is the expression given for the cross-section σ in part (a).

 σ = π R² (1 + V_esc² / V₀²).  

• Candidate 1’s line for the formula is truncated:  
 σ = π R² (1 + V_esc² …  
There is no denominator shown, no closing parenthesis, and thus the expression is incomplete/ambiguous. Because the formula is not fully provided, we cannot confirm it matches the one given by Candidate 2.

Since the main required answer (the formula) is not identical or even complete in Candidate 1, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

(a) Both give the same Lagrangian (kinetic term plus \(+Gm_1m_2/|\mathbf r_1-\mathbf r_2|\)), so they match.

(b) Both state/derive \(V(\alpha\mathbf r_1,\alpha\mathbf r_2)=\alpha^{-1}V(\mathbf r_1,\mathbf r_2)\); they match.

(c)  
• Candidate 1 supplies only the final law \(T^{2}/r^{3}=4\pi^{2}/G(m_1+m_2)\) and omits the required scaling transformation.  
• Candidate 2 gives the transformation (coordinates scaled by \(\alpha\) and time by \(\beta=\alpha^{3/2}\)) but states only the proportionality \(T^{2}\propto a^{3}\), leaving out the explicit constant factor.

Thus the two answers are not identical; each is missing information the other includes. According to Rule 2, when required sub-components differ or one is missing, the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers for the two required sub-questions.

Sub-question (a) (frequency):
• Candidate 1: ν′ = 7/3 ν  
• Candidate 2: ν′ = 7/3 ν  
→ Exactly the same.

Sub-question (b) (angle):
• Candidate 1: θ′ = 21.8°  
• Candidate 2: θ′ = cos⁻¹(13/14).

Evaluating cos⁻¹(13/14) gives ≈ 0.380506 rad = 21.797° (when expressed in degrees). Thus the numerical value coincides with 21.8° to four significant digits. The expression in Candidate 2 uniquely fixes the angle; Candidate 1 gives the same angle numerically. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Since both sub-answers match, the candidates are equivalent.

The question’s part (b) explicitly asks for BOTH  

1. the differential equation of motion, and  
2. the solution \(V(x)\).

Candidate 2 supplies both (“\(m\,dv/dx=-bv\)” and \(V(x)=V_0 e^{-(b/m)x}\)), whereas Candidate 1 gives only the solution \(V(x)=V_0 e^{-(b/m)x}\) and never states the differential equation itself.  Because a required component is missing from Candidate 1, the two answer sets are not completely identical for that sub-problem.  

According to Rule 2, an omission of any required element makes the answers inequivalent.

Both candidates give identical numerical values and formulas for  

(a) \(V_0\) and \(t\),  
(c) the depth where the speed is \(V_0/10\), and  
(d) \(x(t)\).

However, sub-problem (b) explicitly asks to “set up the equation of motion … and solve.”  
• Candidate 2 supplies both parts: the differential equation \(m \dfrac{dv}{dt} = -bv^{2}\) and the solution \(V(x)=V_0 e^{-(b/m)x}\).  
• Candidate 1 gives only the solution \(V(x)=V_0 e^{-(b/m)x}\) and omits the differential equation itself.

Because Candidate 1 does not provide one of the required components that Candidate 2 does, the two answer sets are not identical for every requested item.

The question has five sub-parts (a)–(e).  
We must compare each candidate’s explicit answer to every sub-part.

(a)  Both candidates say the motion is planar:  
• C1: “𝒓·𝒉 = 0.”  
• C2: “Conservation of angular momentum implies the motion is confined to a plane.”  
→ Equivalent.

(b)  Position vs. time:  
• C1: x = a sin(ωt+π/2) = a cos ωt, y = (√(m/K) V₀) sin ωt (ω = √(K/m)).  
• C2: x = a cos ωt, y = (V/ω) sin ωt.  
Since V/ω = √(m/K) V, these are the same.  
→ Equivalent.

(c)  Orbit: both eliminate t and obtain an ellipse.  
→ Equivalent.

(d)  Period: both give T = 2π√(m/K).  
→ Equivalent.

(e)  Kepler’s laws:  
• C2 states explicitly: “Only the second law holds; the motion does not fully obey Kepler’s laws.”  
• C1 gives only a formula for T²/a³ that varies with initial conditions, showing the third law fails, but says nothing about the first and second laws. No clear yes/no (or partial-yes) statement is supplied.

Because sub-part (e) is answered differently—C2 gives a definite qualitative verdict, whereas C1 provides an expression without an explicit verdict or mention of the second law—the two sets of answers are not identical and therefore not equivalent (Rule 2: all requested answers must match).

The question asks for the galaxy’s mass “in units of the sun’s mass.”  
• Candidate 1: 1.53 × 10¹¹ M☉ (explicitly states solar-mass units).  
• Candidate 2: 1.5 × 10¹¹ (implicit solar-mass units).

Even assuming the same units, compare to six significant digits:

Candidate 1 → 1.53000 × 10¹¹  
Candidate 2 → 1.50000 × 10¹¹  

Since 1.53000 ≠ 1.50000 at six significant digits, the numerical values are different. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply:

1. The same two normal‐mode frequencies  
   ω₁ = (√3 + 1)√(g/l),  ω₂ = (√3 − 1)√(g/l).

2. A relation between the two small-angle coordinates (normal-mode shape).  
   • Candidate 1 gives B/A = ∓√3/2 for ω₁ and ω₂.  
   • Candidate 2 gives φ = ∓(2/√3) θ for ω₁ and ω₂.

Since  φ = ∓(2/√3) θ  ⇔  θ/φ = ∓√3/2, Candidate 2’s result is exactly the reciprocal of Candidate 1’s ratio, so the two descriptions are the same up to which coordinate is placed in the numerator. No essential information differs.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts, so each candidate must give three consistent answers.

1. Parts (a) and (b):
   • Candidate 1’s and Candidate 2’s equations are algebraically the same (up to the sign convention for f), so they agree for (a) and (b).

2. Part (c):
   • Candidate 1: “n < 3” (strictly less than 3).
   • Candidate 2: “maximum value of n is 3” (which implies n = 3 is still allowed).

Since Candidate 1 excludes the case n = 3 while Candidate 2 includes it, their predictions differ for part (c).  
Because at least one sub-answer is different, the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates give the same expression for the distance of closest approach (a).

For the angular deflection (b):

• Candidate 1: cot θ = (m V₀² b)/k  ⇒ θ = arctan(k/(m V₀² b))  
• Candidate 2: Θ = 2 arctan(k/(m V₀² b))

Thus Candidate 2’s deflection angle is twice Candidate 1’s.

For the differential cross section (c):

• Candidate 1: (dσ/dΩ) = ¼ (k/(m V₀²))² 1/ sin⁴θ  
• Candidate 2: (dσ/dΩ) = ¼ (k/(m V₀²))² 1/ sin⁴(Θ/2)

These two formulas coincide only if θ in Candidate 1 equals Θ/2, but both candidates present their angles as the same quantity requested in part (b). Therefore the answers for parts (b) and (c) are not the same.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the overall predictions are not equivalent.

The problem ultimately asks for the (single) numerical/functional result—the rate at which the string unwinds—which is
 R ω, valid in either direction.  

• Candidate 1 states that rate twice (“answer 1” and “answer 2”), both equal to R ω.  
• Candidate 2 states the same single result, R ω.

Both give the identical value, with no unit or type discrepancy, and the duplication in Candidate 1 does not create a different answer set; it is merely redundant. Hence the two candidates convey the same final prediction.

Both candidates supply answers for all three sub-parts, so we compare each item.

(a) 145 MeV vs 145 MeV → identical.

(b) Candidate 1: 6.787 × 10¹⁹ eV  
    Candidate 2: 6.8 × 10¹⁹ eV (i.e. 6.80000 × 10¹⁹ eV)

Expressed to six significant digits these are 6.78700 and 6.80000, which differ in the third digit. By Rule 4, numbers must match to six significant digits; therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

(c) Their qualitative statements are consistent in spirit, but since sub-part (b) already disagrees quantitatively, the complete sets of answers are not identical.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts, so each candidate must supply three corresponding answers.

Comparison by sub-problem:

(a) Horizontal range  
• Candidate 1: \(R = \dfrac{v_0^2}{g}\sin 2\theta\)  
• Candidate 2: \(R = \dfrac{v_0^2}{g}\sin 2\theta\)  
These are identical.

(b) Drag force expression  
• Candidate 1: \(\mathbf F_{\text{air}} = -\rho A v^{2}\,\mathbf v\)  
• Candidate 2: \(\mathbf F_{\text{air}} = \dfrac12\rho C_d A v^{2}\) (opposite to \(\mathbf v\))  
The two expressions differ by the factor \(\tfrac12 C_d\) (and Candidate 1 omits any drag coefficient). They are therefore not the same.

(c) Motion with Stokes drag & first-order range correction  
The position functions and range corrections given by the two candidates are visibly different (different decay constants and different correction formulas).

Because at least one sub-answer ((b) and (c)) disagrees, Rule 2 dictates the overall answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical factor, 5/4, multiplying the top-quark mass.  
Candidate 1 writes the result with an explicit factor of c² (SI units), while Candidate 2 omits c² (natural units where c = 1).  
Because in particle-physics problems it is conventional to set c = 1, the two expressions represent the same physical energy once unit conventions are accounted for, and no contradictory numerical value is introduced.

The two answers differ in their units:

• Candidate 1: \(E = \tfrac{5}{4}\,m_t\,c^{2}\) (energy, includes the \(c^{2}\) factor).  
• Candidate 2: \(E = \tfrac{5}{4}\,m_t\) (mass-only expression, no \(c^{2}\)).

Because the presence or absence of the \(c^{2}\) factor changes the physical dimension and the question does not explicitly state that natural units (\(c=1\)) are being used, the two responses are not unambiguously the same quantity. Under Rule 1 this unit mismatch makes the answers inequivalent.

Since stating “n must be at least X” and “the minimum n is X” convey the same quantitative requirement, the two answers are effectively identical.

Both candidates give the same mathematical expression:

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same formula:

Candidate 1:  k ( ∇T / T )^2  
If one writes (∇T / T)^2 explicitly, it is k |∇T|^2 / T^2 (the vector ∇T divided by the scalar T, then squared → magnitude squared).

Candidate 2:  k |∇T|^2 / T^2

Thus they are algebraically identical, with the same units and meaning.

• Candidate 1 gives 8.6 × 10² s = 860 s.  
• Candidate 2 gives 2778 (no unit stated, but the only reasonable unit here is seconds).

Even assuming Candidate 2’s number is in seconds, 2778 s ≠ 860 s.

Both candidates give the relation that ultimately needs to be shown:

• The problem statement already defines λ ≡ exp(μ/kT).  
• Candidate 1 writes “λ = n V_Q”.  
 Since λ is defined as exp(μ/kT), this implicitly yields exp(μ/kT) = n V_Q.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly writes “λ = exp(μ/kT) = n V_Q”.

Thus, after using the definition of λ supplied in the question, the two predictions convey exactly the same equality among the three quantities. Hence they are equivalent.

• Candidate 1: “The work on the monatomic gas is greater than that on the diatomic gas” (i.e., for the diatomic gas the work is less).  
• Candidate 2: “less” (work for the diatomic gas is less).  
→ Same verdict: the work is less for the diatomic gas.

Thus, for every sub-problem both candidates actually answered, their responses convey the same information. Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives T ≈ 5 × 10³ K = 5000 K.  
Candidate 2 gives 5500 K.  

Both answers are in Kelvin, but 5000.00 and 5500.00 differ at the first significant digit (rule 4). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions for ΔL are completely different:

Candidate 1:  
ΔL = [ dL₀/dT – W /((4π²W ν² / g)²) · d/dT(4π²W ν² / g) ] · ΔQ / C_W

Candidate 2:  
ΔL = – M /(k T) · ΔQ

• They contain different sets of variables and constants (C_W, W, ν, g, derivatives with respect to T in Candidate 1 versus M, k, T in Candidate 2).  
• The dimensional structure is different: Candidate 1 has the extra factor 1/C_W and derivatives, while Candidate 2 simply has –M/(kT).  
• There is no stated identification that could make one expression algebraically reduce to the other.

By Rule 1 and Rule 8, the two answers are not mathematically or dimensionally equivalent.

The two candidates give answers for each of the six requested sub-parts.  
Comparing them term-by-term:

(a) Density of states D(ε): after converting h ↔ ħ, both formulas are identical → they coincide.

(b) Mean occupation number: both give 1/(e^{(ε−μ)/kT}−1) → identical.

(c) Integral for N (or n): the numerical prefactor of the integral in candidate 1 is (4π√2/ħ³) m^{3/2}(kT)^{3/2}, while candidate 2 has √2/(2π²ħ³) m^{3/2}(kT)^{3/2}.  These differ by a factor 8π³, so the expressions are not equivalent.  Thus the two sets of answers already disagree.

(d) Consequently their Tc expressions differ as well (different prefactors / undefined “A” in candidate 1).

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two overall responses are not equivalent.

The question asks for several separate numerical predictions:
1. T_R  
2. T_V  
3. (C_v , C_p) at each of the four temperatures.

Hence every one of these quantities must agree for the two candidates to be equivalent (Rule 2).

Comparison:

1. T_R  
   • Cand 1: 75 K  
   • Cand 2: 75 K  
   → identical.

2. T_V  
   • Cand 1: 6250 K  
   • Cand 2: 6240 K  

   Using the same unit (kelvin), the two numbers differ by 10 K.  Expressed with six significant digits:  
   6250.00 vs 6240.00 – they are not the same at the 3rd significant digit, so they are unequal (Rule 4).

3. C_v and C_p at the four listed temperatures  
   All four (C_v , C_p) pairs correspond numerically:

   • 3/2 R = 12.47 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ ≈ 12.5 (Cand 1)  
   • 5/2 R = 20.79 ≈ 20.8 (Cand 1)  
   • 5/2 R = 20.79 ≈ 20.8 (Cand 1)  
   • 7/2 R = 29.10 ; 9/2 R = 37.41 ≈ 29.1 & 37.4 (Cand 1)

   These match.

However, because T_V does NOT match exactly, at least one required sub-answer differs, so the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates give the numerical value 0.610000 (to six significant digits).  
Units:

• Candidate 1: cal /K (for the given gram-atomic weight, i.e. one mole).  
• Candidate 2: cal /(mol·K).

Since the problem concerns one mole of silver, “cal /K for the sample” is the same as “cal /(mol·K)”. The slight difference in how the mole is indicated does not create any real ambiguity here. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates answer all three sub-questions, so we compare each sub-answer:

(a) Partition function: both give  z = Σ e^(–βE)  → equivalent.

(b) Relation to heat capacity:
• Candidate 1:  C_v = (1 / (k β²)) (∂² ln z / ∂β²)  
• Candidate 2:  C   = k β² (∂² ln z / ∂β²)

These differ by a factor k² β⁴; they are not the same formula.

(c) Two-level system heat capacity: after algebra, both candidates’ formulas reduce to  
C = k (Δ/kT)² e^{Δ/kT} / (1 + e^{Δ/kT})², so the expressions are equivalent.

Because sub-answer (b) is different, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas:

• Candidate 1: Δp = φ² / (4 π r²)  
• Candidate 2: Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)

These differ by the factor ε₀/2 versus 1/(4π). Because ε₀ and 1/(4π) are not equal within the same unit system, and no consistent unit conversion is provided that makes the two expressions match, the predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 1: Δp = φ² / (4 π r²)  
Candidate 2: Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)

Even if we try to interpret them as being written in different unit systems (Gaussian vs. SI), the numerical factors and the explicit appearance of ε₀ do not match after any straightforward conversion.  In Gaussian units one would expect Δp = φ² / (8 π r²), not φ² / (4 π r²).  Hence the two expressions are not the same.

The two expressions are not algebraically the same.

Let  
• Candidate 1: R₁ = (x/4) [2 + (α₁+α₂) ΔT] / [(α₂−α₁) ΔT]  
• Candidate 2: R₂ = x / [2 (α₂−α₁) ΔT]

Form the ratio:

 R₁ / R₂ = [(x/4)(2 + (α₁+α₂)ΔT)/(α₂−α₁)ΔT] ÷ [x/(2(α₂−α₁)ΔT)]
       = (1/4)(2 + (α₁+α₂)ΔT) × 2
       = ½ [2 + (α₁+α₂)ΔT]
       = 1 + ½(α₁+α₂)ΔT.

Except when ΔT = 0 (or trivially α₁+α₂ = 0), this ratio differs from 1, so R₁ ≠ R₂ for general values.

Hence the two candidates give different predictions.

The question requires answers for two sub-parts:  
(a) the high-temperature value of \(c_v\);  
(b) the exponents \(\alpha\) and \(\gamma\).

Candidate 1:  
(a) \(c_v = Nk\) (i.e. \(N k_B\))  
(b) \(\alpha = 1,\; \gamma = 1\)

Candidate 2:  
(a) \(c_v = k_B\)  
(b) \(\alpha = 1,\; \gamma = 1\)

Comparison:

• Sub-part (a): Candidate 1’s result differs from Candidate 2’s by a factor of \(N\). Since the problem statement involves \(N\gg 1\) particles and does not declare \(c_v\) to be per particle, these two results are not the same quantity; \(k_B\) and \(N k_B\) are inequivalent (Rule 1, Rule 2).

• Sub-part (b): Both candidates give the same exponents, but equivalence for all sub-answers is required; a discrepancy in any part makes the whole set not equivalent (Rule 2).

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply three sub-answers addressing parts (a), (b) and (c).  
For each part, the content conveyed is essentially the same:

(a) Both state that MB treats particles as distinguishable with no occupancy limit, whereas FD applies to indistinguishable fermions obeying the Pauli exclusion principle.  
(b) Both give qualitative descriptions of the two curves: MB curves broaden/flatten with higher T; FD curves show a sharp drop at low T that smooths out at higher T, and each identifies which curve corresponds to the higher temperature.  
(c) Both explain that MB predicts a specific-heat contribution of 3/2 k_B per electron (far too large), while FD resolves this by allowing only electrons near the Fermi surface to be thermally excited, giving a much smaller heat capacity.

No part required by the question is omitted by either candidate, and no contradictory details appear. Hence the two sets of answers are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical temperature in °C.  
Both candidates supply a value in the same unit.

Express each answer to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 48.57 °C → 48.5700  
• Candidate 2: 48.57142857 °C → 48.5714

Comparing the first six significant digits:

48.5700  
48.5714

They differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits (0 0 vs 1 4), so they do not match to six significant digits.

1. high-T specific heat,  
2. high-T entropy,  
3. low-T specific heat (lowest non-zero term),  
4. low-T entropy (lowest non-zero term).

Candidate 1 supplies non-zero, exponentially small expressions for items 3 and 4.  
Candidate 2 states those same quantities are exactly zero.

Since at least two of the four requested answers differ, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 5 × 10⁻³.

Both candidates give formulas for

1. the “low-temperature” condition  
2. the average energy E(T)  
3. the molar specific heat C_v(T).

Compare each item:

Low-temperature condition  
• Cand 1: “T_c ≈ 10 ε /(k ln N)” (depends on some unspecified N)  
• Cand 2: “T ≪ 9 ε /k_B”.  
Not the same expression.

Average energy  
• Cand 1: E = ε[ e^{-ε/kT}+10 e^{-10ε/kT} ] / [1+e^{-ε/kT}+e^{-10ε/kT}] (three-level formula).  
• Cand 2: E = ε /(e^{ε/k_BT}+1) (two-level formula).  
The two expressions are different.

Specific heat  
• Cand 1: C_v = R ε² β² [ e^{-βε}+100 e^{-10βε}+81 e^{-11βε} ] /(1+e^{-βε}+e^{-10βε})².  
• Cand 2: C_v = R (ε/k_BT)² e^{ε/k_BT}/(e^{ε/k_BT}+1)².  
Again, not the same formula.

Because the corresponding answers differ for every required sub-problem, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The relevant quantity to compare is the specific-heat expression.

Candidate 1 (exact expression, their “answer 3”):
C_v = R ε² β² [ e^{-βε} + 100 e^{-10 βε} + 81 e^{-11 βε} ] / [1 + e^{-βε} + e^{-10 βε}]².

Candidate 2:
C_v = R (ε/kT)² e^{ε/kT} / [1 + e^{ε/kT}]²
      = R ε² β² e^{-βε}/[1 + e^{-βε}]²   (after rewriting).

The two formulae differ: Candidate 1 contains extra terms involving the third level (10 ε) and large numerical coefficients (100, 81) that are absent in Candidate 2. Thus the two predictions are not algebraically identical except in the extreme low-temperature limit where the extra terms become negligible; the exact answers are different.

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates answer all three sub-problems, so we compare each sub-answer:

(a)  
• Candidate 1: U = U₀ + nE  
• Candidate 2: U = nE  
These differ by the extra baseline term U₀; they are not the same unless one assumes U₀ = 0, which is not specified.

(b)  
Both give S = 2k[ N ln N − n ln n − (N−n) ln(N−n) ] – identical.

(c)  
Both give n = N / (1 + e^{E/2kT}) – identical.

Because the answers differ for part (a), the overall predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has three sub-parts, so answers for (a), (b) and (c) must match exactly.

(a) Internal energy  
• Candidate 1: U = U₀ + nE  
• Candidate 2: U = nE  
These are different (U₀ term present vs. absent).

(b) Entropy  
• Candidate 1: S = 2k[N ln N − n ln n − (N−n) ln(N−n)]  
• Candidate 2: S = 2kn[ln(N/n) + 1]  
Not algebraically identical; Candidate 2 is only a leading-order approximation of Candidate 1 for n ≪ N.

(c) Equilibrium number of defects  
• Candidate 1: n = N / (e^{E/2kT} + 1)  
• Candidate 2: n = N e^{−E/2kT}  
Again, Candidate 2 is an approximation of Candidate 1 for large E/(kT), not the same expression.

Since at least one sub-answer differs in each part, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem effectively requires three explicit items:  

1. The middle‐plane temperature \(T_m\).  
2. The new net flux for a black middle plane (showing it is half of the original).  
3. The modification of that flux when the middle plane has reflectivity \(r\).

Candidate 1 supplies all three:

• \(T_m=[\tfrac12(T_u^4+T_l^4)]^{1/4}\)  
• \(J_U=\tfrac12\sigma_B\,(T_u^4-T_l^4)\) (half the original)  
• With reflectivity \(r\): \(J_U'=(1-r)\tfrac12\sigma_B\,(T_u^4-T_l^4)\)

Candidate 2 gives only:

• \(T_m=[\tfrac{T_u^4+T_l^4}{2}]^{1/4}\) (same as C1)  
• “The flux density is multiplied by \(1-r\).”

Candidate 2 never states (or even implies) the halved flux for the black middle plane, so one of the required results is missing. Under Rule 2 (multiple sub-answers), omission of a required component means the answers are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts: (a), (b), and (c).  
Rule 2 requires that each candidate supply answers to all requested sub-problems.

• Both candidates give the same result for (a): \(v^{2}=dp/d\rho\).  
• Both candidates give equivalent expressions for the isothermal and adiabatic speeds in (b).  
• Sub-problem (c) asks explicitly “Which gives a better result for air?”.  
  – Candidate 2 answers this directly: “Adiabatic case gives a better result for air.”  
  – Candidate 1 lists numerical values (280 m/s and 331 m/s) but never states which of the two is the “better result.” Hence Candidate 1 does not explicitly answer sub-problem (c).

Because Candidate 1 omits an explicit answer to one required sub-problem while Candidate 2 provides it, the two sets of answers are not equivalent under Rule 2.

The original problem has two sub-parts:

(a) an expression for the entropy σ(N,τ);
(b) an expression for the free energy F(N,τ) (and then σ derived from it).

Candidate 2 supplies both:
• σ(N,τ)  (two equivalent forms)  
• F(N,τ)

Candidate 1 supplies only σ(N,τ); it gives no expression for the free energy at all.  
Because Candidate 1 lacks an answer to sub-problem (b), while Candidate 2 provides it, the two sets of predictions are not identical.

The two expressions are algebraically different.

1. Exponential factors  
   • Candidate 1 contains exp(−ε₀/τ) and exp(−ε₀/(2τ)).  
   • Candidate 2 contains exp(+ε₀/(k_BT)) and exp(+ε₀/(2k_BT)).  
   The signs of the exponents are opposite, so the Boltzmann factors are not the same.

2. Pressure constants  
   • Candidate 1 has an extra constant p₀ inside both numerator and denominator.  
   • Candidate 2 has no such term; its denominator is “1 + …” with no additive constant differing from unity.

Because of the opposite exponent signs and the presence/absence of the additional p₀ term, the two formulae cannot be transformed into each other by simple symbol relabelling. They yield different numerical values for the same P, T, ε₀.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are structurally different.

1. Exponential signs  
   • Candidate 1 contains factors e^{-ε₀/(τ)} and e^{-ε₀/(2τ)} (negative exponent).  
   • Candidate 2 contains factors e^{+ε₀/(k_B T)} and e^{+ε₀/(2 k_B T)} (positive exponent).  
   These cannot both be correct simultaneously for the same ε₀ definition.

2. Overall form  
   • Candidate 1’s denominator is the square of a linear term, [ … ]².  
   • Candidate 2’s denominator is a quadratic polynomial that is not a perfect square.  
   No simple relabelling of symbols (P ↔ p, τ ↔ k_B T, p₀ ↔ 1, etc.) converts one form into the other.

3. Numerical prefactors  
   • Candidate 1 has an explicit factor 2 in the numerator; Candidate 2 does not.

Because of these incompatibilities, the two candidates are not mathematically equivalent answers to the same question.
The two expressions are not algebraically the same.  
• Candidate 2’s numerator is P [exp(ε₀/kT) + exp(ε₀/2kT)], containing two exponential factors corresponding to the two binding energies.  
• Candidate 1’s numerator is p [1 + exp(−ε₀/2τ)]; it lacks a term proportional to exp(±ε₀/τ) and even carries the opposite sign in the exponent of the remaining term.  

The denominators differ analogously (Candidate 1 uses p₀ + …, Candidate 2 uses 1 + …). Because the required exponential factors and signs do not match, no simple rescaling of symbols can make the two formulas identical.

Hence the candidates give inequivalent answers.

The question asks for five specific numerical values of \(e_c(G_i,7)\) (for \(i=1,\dots,5\)).  

• Candidate 1 supplies concrete values:  
  \(e_c(G_1,7)=324,\ e_c(G_2,7)=338,\ e_c(G_3,7)=332,\ e_c(G_4,7)=332,\ e_c(G_5,7)=344\).

• Candidate 2 states that there is “Insufficient information” and provides no numbers.

According to Rule 2, when a problem requires multiple answers and one candidate provides them while the other provides none (or claims they cannot be determined), the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different formulas.

1. Diagonal entries:
   • Candidate 1 explicitly sets (Hα⁻¹)_{ii}=0.  
   • Candidate 2 offers one single formula for every pair (i,j); it would give 0 on the diagonal only if the stated sum happened to vanish automatically, which is not guaranteed by the formula itself.

2. Sign exponent:
   • Candidate 1 uses (|E(P)| – 1)/2.  
   • Candidate 2 uses the “number of non-matching edges in P.”  
     For a general co-augmenting path these two counts are not the same in general, so the signs can differ.

Because the two prescriptions disagree in at least these respects, the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different formulas.  
For n = 1, Candidate 1 yields 2^{a₁}, while Candidate 2 gives a₁ + 1; these coincide only for special values (a₁ = 0 or 1) but are unequal in general (e.g., a₁ = 2 gives 4 vs. 3). Hence the expressions are not the same formula for arbitrary aᵢ.

• Candidate 2: ∏_{i=1}^{n} a_i

These expressions are not the same function of the variables a₁,…,a_n (one involves powers of 2, the other is just the product of the a_i). Except for accidental coincidences in very special cases, they yield different numerical values, so the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2’s highest power of p is only p^{6k} (since p^{3k}(p^{k}-1)^3 = p^{6k}-3p^{5k}+…).

Because there is no information given that would equate r(X′) with n – c(X′), or 2^{s(X′)} with the omission of a 2-power in Candidate 2, or Re(Π hα(→C)) with Π ω(C), the two expressions cannot be shown to be the same. Hence they are not equivalent.

Since m(2m + 1) ≠ 1 for any positive integer m (and, in fact, for any real m except the impossible simultaneous solutions m = 0 and 2m + 1 = 1/0), the two formulas are different functions of m. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical/algebraic expression (the degree of the polynomial) in terms of d and k.

Candidate 1:  “\(\binom{d}{k}\)”  
Candidate 2:  “\(dk\)”

These two expressions are plainly different for generic integers \(d,k\) (e.g. for \(d=5,\ k=2\) we have \(\binom{5}{2}=10\) whereas \(dk = 10\) actually same in this example, but for \(d=5,\ k=3\): \(\binom{5}{3}=10\) vs \(dk=15\)). Since they are not algebraically identical in general, the answers are not equivalent.

Therefore, according to Rule 4/Rule 8, the candidates give different results; they are not equivalent.

The two expressions are clearly different.

1. Denominator  
   • Candidate 1: ∏_{k=1}^{∞} (1 − q^{k})^{−2} · ∏_{k=1}^{∞}(1 + q^{k−1/2})  
   • Candidate 2: ∏_{k=1}^{∞} (1 − q^{k})^{−2}

   Candidate 1 contains the extra infinite product ∏_{k=1}^{∞}(1 + q^{k−1/2}), which is absent in Candidate 2.

2. Numerator  
   • For even p, Candidate 1 gives (1 − q^{p}) whereas Candidate 2 also has (1 − q^{p}); but the extra product above still remains, so the two whole expressions differ by that product.  
   • For odd p, Candidate 1’s numerator is (1 − q^{p/2}), not equal to Candidate 2’s (1 − q^{p}).

Because of these mismatches the two characters cannot be the same function of q. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are structurally very different.

Candidate 1  
char = q^{h_L} · finite factor [(1 – q^{p/2}) times another parity–dependent term] · 
               Π_{k=1}^{∞} (1 + q^{k–1/2}) / (1 – q^{k})²  
     = q^{h_L} · (… ) · [ (–q^{1/2}; q)_{∞} / (q)_{∞}² ]

Candidate 2  
char = q^{h_L} · (q^{p}; q^{p})_{∞} / (q)_{∞}²  
     = q^{h_L} · Π_{n=1}^{∞}(1 – q^{pn}) / (1 – q^{n})²

Thus

• The infinite numerator product in Candidate 1 is (–q^{1/2}; q)_{∞}, containing factors (1 + q^{k–1/2}).  
• The infinite numerator product in Candidate 2 is (q^{p}; q^{p})_{∞}, containing factors (1 – q^{pn}).

These two products are not the same (they involve different signs and exponents: half-integers vs multiples of p).  
Even after including the extra finite factor (1 – q^{p}) or (1 – q^{p/2}) in Candidate 1, there is no identity that converts (–q^{1/2}; q)_{∞} into (q^{p}; q^{p})_{∞}. Consequently the two proposed characters are not algebraically equivalent.

Therefore the candidates give different answers.

The question requires three specific numeric answers, one for each of the three listed cases.

• Candidate 1 supplies:  
 (i) 6, (ii) 4, (iii) 5.

• Candidate 2 supplies:  
 (i) 3, (ii) 2, (iii) 3 (by position).

The corresponding values differ in every case (6 ≠ 3, 4 ≠ 2, 5 ≠ 3).  
Thus the two predictions are not the same.

The two formulas give different numerical results in general (e.g. for m = 2, n = 1, Candidate 1 gives 0 while Candidate 2 gives 1/4). Hence they are not algebraically identical.

The two expressions are not equivalent.

• Take \(m = 2\) and \(n = 1\).

  Candidate 1  
  \(P = 1 - \dfrac{2n(m-1)^{\,n-1} + (m-2)^{\,n}}{m^{\,n}}
      = 1 - \dfrac{2\cdot 1\cdot 1^{0} + 0}{2^{1}}
      = 1 - 1 = 0.\)

  Candidate 2  
  \(P = 1 - \left(1 - \dfrac{1}{m^{2}}\right)^{n}
      = 1 - \left(1 - \dfrac14\right)^1
      = 1 - \dfrac34 = \dfrac14.\)

Since \(0 \neq \tfrac14\), the two formulas give different probabilities. Hence the candidates are inequivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions.

•  Candidate 1 is a sum of three separate terms, the first beginning with 1, the second starting at order q³, and the third at order q⁴; hence its q¹–coefficient is 0.

•  Candidate 2 is a single infinite-product ratio.  Expanding to first order shows a non-zero q¹–coefficient (in fact 6), because the factor (J₁)^{-6} contributes a linear term while the other factors start at order q² or higher.

Since the q¹–coefficients already differ, the two series cannot be identical. Thus the candidates are not equivalent.

The question expects one numerical answer in eV.  
• Candidate 1 gives 0.038 (unit not stated, but presumably eV).  
• Candidate 2 gives 0.0387 eV.

Treating both as eV, compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
– Candidate 1 → 0.038000  
– Candidate 2 → 0.038700  

These differ at the 3rd significant digit, so the answers are not the same.  
(The omitted unit in Candidate 1 also introduces ambiguity, reinforcing inequivalence per Rule 1.)

The two predictions express the same numerical value for the WACC: 
• Candidate 1: 0.0758 (decimal form)  
• Candidate 2: 7.58 % = 0.0758 (percentage converted to decimal)

They are identical to six significant digits once expressed in the same unit.

The question requests two separate values:  
1) the time for one oscillation (a period in seconds)  
2) the angular frequency (in units of 10⁷ rad/s).

• Candidate 1 supplies only one number, “4.2”, with no explicit unit or second value.  
• Candidate 2 supplies two numbers: “1.4925 × 10⁻⁷ s” for the period and “4.2097” (presumably × 10⁷ rad/s) for the angular frequency.

Because Candidate 1 fails to give the required period and thus provides fewer answers than the question demands, while Candidate 2 provides both required answers, the two candidates’ outputs are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two answers represent the following numerical values:

• Candidate 1: 0.000198 → 1.98000 × 10⁻⁴ (expressed to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 1/5040 ≈ 0.000198412698… → 1.98413 × 10⁻⁴ (expressed to 6 significant digits)

Since 1.98000 × 10⁻⁴ and 1.98413 × 10⁻⁴ differ within the first six significant digits, the two predictions are not the same number.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value −0.459 (which becomes −0.459000 when written to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives the exact expression cos 1 − 1, whose numerical value is ≈ −0.459697 (= −0.459698 to six significant digits).

Comparing −0.459000 with −0.459698, the values differ beginning at the fourth decimal place; they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
The numerical value of cos(1) − 1 (in radians) is approximately −0.459698 (to six significant digits).  
Candidate 1 gives −0.459000, which differs from this at the fourth decimal place, so the two answers do NOT match to six significant digits.

To compare two numerical answers we use Rule 4: treat each as a real number and check whether they match to 6 significant digits.

Candidate 1: 0.367879441  →  six-digit form: 0.367879  
Candidate 2: 0.368         →  six-digit form (pad with zeros): 0.368000  

0.367879 ≠ 0.368000 at the sixth (indeed already at the third) significant digit, so the two answers are not the same.  
(The fact that the question asked for rounding to the thousandth does not override Rule 4 for equivalence checking.)

The question asks for a single numerical value (a maximum initial velocity).  

Candidate 1 gives 18.25 (no unit stated, but clearly a number for velocity).  
Candidate 2 gives 12.5 m/s.  

Assuming both are meant in the same unit (m/s), the numerical values 18.2500 and 12.5000 differ well beyond six significant digits. Therefore they are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give single numerical answers for the maximum initial velocity.

• Candidate 1: 18.25 (units implicitly m s⁻¹).  
• Candidate 2: √(14 g).  With g = 9.8 m s⁻², this equals √(14 × 9.8) ≈ √137.2 ≈ 11.719 (m s⁻¹).

Comparing the values to six significant digits:

18.25000 ≠ 11.71900.

Since the numerical results are clearly different, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value (the covariance).  
Candidate 1 gives 1.67 (→ 1.670000 to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives 5/3 (→ 1.666667 to six significant digits).

Comparing 1.670000 and 1.666667, they differ in the fourth significant digit, so they are not equal to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value: 3.1.  

Candidate 2 explicitly includes the unit “eV,” while Candidate 1 omits the unit.  
The question explicitly asks for the photon energy “in eV,” so it is unambiguous that the number supplied by Candidate 1 must also be in eV. Therefore the omission does not introduce confusion, and the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two answers give the same numerical value (3.1) to six significant digits, but:

• Candidate 2 explicitly states the unit “eV,” which the question requires.  
• Candidate 1 gives no unit at all. Because energy could reasonably be expressed either in eV or in joules, omitting the unit introduces ambiguity (Rule 1).

Therefore the two answers are not considered equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers give the same numerical value for the photon energy:

• Candidate 1: 3.1  
• Candidate 2: 3.10 eV

1. Unit check (Rule 1):  
   – The question explicitly asks for the energy “in eV.”  
   – Candidate 2 includes “eV.”  
   – Candidate 1 omits the unit, but since the question specifies eV, the natural and unambiguous interpretation of the bare number 3.1 is 3.1 eV. No other unit would reasonably apply in this context, so the omission does not create real ambiguity.

2. Numerical comparison (Rule 4):  
   – 3.1 = 3.10000 to six significant digits.  
   – 3.10 eV = 3.10000 eV.  
   The numbers are identical to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The two numerical answers are:

Candidate 1: 386.4158898  
Candidate 2: 386.416

Express both to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 386.4158898 → 386.416 (because the 7-th digit “8” rounds the 6-th digit up).  
• Candidate 2 → 386.416 (already six significant digits).

They match exactly (386.416 vs. 386.416). Therefore, according to Rule 4, the predictions are equivalent.

Both answers give the same numerical value:  

• Candidate 1: 3448.1 → 3448.10 (adding an implied trailing zero)  
• Candidate 2: $3448.10  

To six significant digits they are identical (3 4 4 8 1 0).  
The dollar sign in Candidate 2 merely makes the currency explicit; the question clearly refers to a dollar amount, so Candidate 1’s omission of the symbol does not create ambiguity.

Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

The two answers give different numerical values:

• Candidate 1: 1850.0 (implicitly nm)  
• Candidate 2: 1879 nm

Even assuming Candidate 1’s value is expressed in nanometres (as required), 1850.0 nm and 1879 nm differ and are not equal to six significant digits. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single numerical value in the same unit (N / m).  
To test equivalence, compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 490.0 → 4.90000 × 10²  
• Candidate 2: 487   → 4.87000 × 10²  

4.90000 × 10² ≠ 4.87000 × 10².

Hence the predictions are not the same.

According to Rule 4, we must compare the two numerical answers to 6 significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 13.609  
  → expressed to 6 significant digits: 13.6090

• Candidate 2: 13.609375  
  → rounded to 6 significant digits: 13.6094

Since 13.6090 ≠ 13.6094 at the sixth significant digit, the two answers are not the same.

Based on Rule 3, the question expects a single ordered list representing the path.  
Candidate 1 gives the list [2, 8, 10] while Candidate 2 gives [2, 6, 10].  
Since the two lists are not identical, the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give exactly one answer, the numerical value “8.”  
Neither candidate supplies the general covariance function, so they provide the same (incomplete) information.  
Since the single value they do provide is identical, their predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for the possible values of g(2023).  
Both candidates give two numerical answers, so we compare the corresponding numbers.

• 2/3 = 0.666 666… (to six significant digits: 0.666 667)  
• Candidate 1’s first value is 0.6667 → expressed to six significant digits this is 0.666 700.

Since 0.666 700 ≠ 0.666 667 at the sixth significant digit, the first numbers are not equal by Rule 4.  
The same mismatch occurs for the negative values (-0.666 700 vs ‑0.666 667).

Because at least one of the paired answers differs, the two candidates’ lists are not identical, so they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question requires two possible numerical values.  
Candidate 1 lists 0.6667 and –0.6667 (≈ 0.666700 and –0.666700 to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 lists 2/3 and –2/3 (≈ 0.666667 and –0.666667 to six significant digits).  

Using Rule 4, we must compare the numbers to six significant digits.  
0.666700 differs from 0.666667 at the 4th significant digit, and –0.666700 differs similarly from –0.666667.  
Because the corresponding numbers are not identical to six significant digits, the two answer lists are not equivalent.

The two answers are numerical values.

Candidate 1: 30.15928896  
Candidate 2: 30.159  (interpreted as 30.159000…)

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1 → 30.1593  
• Candidate 2 → 30.1590  

They differ at the 6-th significant digit (3 vs 0), so the answers are not identical. Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

The question requires one numerical answer (frequency in units of 10¹¹ Hz).  
Candidate 1 gives 5.63, while Candidate 2 gives 7.95.

The answers are numerical probabilities (unit-less).  
Convert Candidate 2 to decimal:

133 / 780 ≈ 0.170512820…

Compare to Candidate 1’s 0.1705.  
Express both to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 0.170500  
• Candidate 2 → 0.170512

They differ at the 5th–6th significant digits, so by Rule 4 they are not the same value.

The two candidates give numerical answers:

• Candidate 1: 31.4  
• Candidate 2: 10 π ≈ 31.415926…

Expressed to six significant digits,
– Candidate 1 = 31.4000  
– Candidate 2 = 31.4159  

Since 31.4000 and 31.4159 differ within the first six significant digits, the answers are not identical according to Rule 4. Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
