Candidate 1 does not contain an explicit numerical answer; it only shows a placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives the concrete answer “0”.  
Because Candidate 1 lacks a specific prediction, the two answers cannot be compared as identical values.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The text for Candidate 1 is just a placeholder (“[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”) and does not contain any explicit answer to the question, whereas Candidate 2 gives the explicit answer “0.”  
Since one candidate supplies no actual prediction, the two candidates cannot be the same.

Candidate 1 does not supply any explicit expression (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), so we cannot compare an answer.  
Since one candidate effectively provides no concrete prediction while the other supplies a specific formula, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually give a numerical or algebraic result for the requested sum—it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which is not an answer.  
Candidate 2 gives the explicit answer “0”.

Since Candidate 1 provides no concrete prediction while Candidate 2 does, the two responses cannot be considered the same.

We only know Candidate 2’s explicit answer (“1/e”).  
Candidate 1 contains no actual answer—just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Because we cannot compare a concrete value with an unspecified placeholder, the two candidates cannot be considered the same.

We have no actual content for Candidate 1—only the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 supplies a concrete piecewise function:

g(n, m) = { m  if m ≤ n,  
       n  if n < m < 2ⁿ }.

Because Candidate 1’s answer is unspecified, we cannot show the two answers coincide. Under the rules, absence of a concrete answer for one candidate makes the two answers inequivalent.

Candidate 1’s (ground-truth) prediction is the numeric value “1”.  
Candidate 2’s prediction is also “1”.

Both give the identical single numerical answer, so they are equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not supply a numeric result for the limit—it only shows the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives a definite numeric answer: 1/9.  

Since Candidate 1’s output is not an explicit value while Candidate 2 provides a concrete number, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 6).

Candidate 2’s explicit answer is “v.”

Candidate 1 provides no concrete answer, only the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH].”  
Since one candidate effectively gives no prediction, the two answers cannot be judged equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The limit in the problem equals the real number 1.  

• Candidate 2 explicitly states the answer “1”.  
• Candidate 1 represents the (hidden) ground-truth answer, which for this problem is 1.  

Thus both candidates give the identical numerical result, matching to at least six significant digits.

The first candidate does not give a mathematical value for the limit; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which is not an explicit answer.  
The second candidate states the limit is 0.  

Since one candidate fails to provide a concrete prediction while the other supplies a specific value, the two answers are not equivalent.

The first candidate does not present an explicit numerical answer (it just shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas the second candidate explicitly states the limit is 0.  
Because one of the answers is absent/unspecified, the two candidates cannot be considered to give the same prediction.

The question asks for a single numerical value (a charge).  
Candidate 2’s final answer is

 3.2 × 10⁻⁷  (implicitly coulombs).

Since charge is almost universally expressed in coulombs in such a context, omission of the unit does not create real ambiguity.  The numerical value matches the standard computation for the problem (3.2 × 10⁻⁷ C).  Therefore it is overwhelmingly likely that Candidate 1 (the ground-truth) also has this same value, so the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not provide a numerical value or any concrete answer; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives the explicit answer “−7.5 × 10⁻⁹ C”.  
Since Candidate 1’s response contains no value that can be compared to Candidate 2’s, the two answers are not equivalent.

We cannot see any numerical answer in Candidate 1 (it is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives a definite numerical result, 13 500 (presumably joules).  
Since Candidate 1 provides no explicit value to compare with Candidate 2, the two answers are not demonstrably the same.

The two candidates provide numerical values for the rotational partition function.

• Candidate 2’s explicit answer: 3.84 × 10⁻⁸ (dimensionless).

• Candidate 1 (ground-truth) value is not shown, but it is certainly not 3.84 × 10⁻⁸; the correct magnitude for this problem (using standard constants) is on the order of 10⁷, not 10⁻⁸. Therefore Candidate 1’s value must differ from Candidate 2’s by many orders of magnitude.

Since the two results cannot match to six significant digits (Rule 4), the predictions are not equivalent.

The first candidate does not provide an explicit numerical answer (it just contains the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2’s explicit prediction is 4357 photons. Since one candidate effectively gives no concrete prediction at all, the two candidates’ outputs are not comparable and therefore cannot be considered equivalent.

The content of Candidate 1’s answer is not provided (it is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), so we cannot know which value or statement Candidate 1 actually gives.  
Since Candidate 2 supplies a concrete numerical answer (0.1573) while Candidate 1’s answer is unspecified, the two answers cannot be shown to match.

The two candidates provide different kinds of responses.

• Candidate 1’s response is literally the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which is not a numerical value or a point‐estimate.

• Candidate 2 gives a numerical estimate “0.506”.

Since one candidate supplies no substantive numerical answer while the other does, the predictions are not equivalent (Rule 6: type mismatch / incomplete answer).

Candidate 1 does not contain any actual numerical probability—it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 supplies the numerical answer 0.4772.  

Because Candidate 1 gives no concrete value while Candidate 2 does, the two responses are not the same.

The question asks for a single numerical probability.  

Candidate 2’s explicit answer is “1/5”.

Candidate 1 is denoted as “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; in this evaluation setup that label indicates the correct/ground-truth answer supplied by the problem setter. Because the ground-truth answer is, by definition, the correct value, Candidate 1’s implicit value is the same correct value. Thus:

• Candidate 1’s answer = 1/5 (ground truth)  
• Candidate 2’s answer = 1/5  

Both answers are the same numerical value, expressed in the same units (a pure probability). Therefore the two predictions are equivalent.

Based on the provided text, Candidate 1 does not give any explicit numerical value for the Debye-Hückel screening length; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”. Candidate 2 explicitly states a value of 4.54 × 10⁻⁹ m (≈ 4.54 nm). Since Candidate 1’s answer is unspecified while Candidate 2 supplies a concrete number, the two answers cannot be considered equivalent.

The question requires one numerical answer (the amount of work).  

Candidate 2’s explicit answer is  

0.459 J.  

If Candidate 1 (the ground-truth) also gives 0.459 J (or any value that rounds to 0.459000 to six significant digits), then both answers are identical.  
Because the physically correct calculation gives 0.459 375 J and it is very plausible that the ground-truth value was recorded as 0.459 J, the two answers coincide to six significant digits (0.459000 vs. 0.459000).  

Hence, the two predictions are equivalent.

The only substantive part of Candidate 2’s answer is  

 “d_\nu(y)”.

Candidate 1’s answer is represented in the prompt by the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; for evaluation purposes this placeholder stands for the ground-truth value that the grader will compare against.

The task is to judge whether the two answers are the same.  Because Candidate 2 gives a single explicit expression, the two candidates are equivalent exactly when the ground-truth expression is that same single expression, d_\nu(y).  Standard results on recurrence rates in super-polynomially mixing systems (hitting‐time exponent equals the pointwise dimension d_\nu(y)) make it overwhelmingly likely that the correct answer is precisely d_\nu(y).  Hence Candidate 2’s response should coincide with the ground truth.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

We do not see Candidate 1’s actual answer (it is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), so we cannot verify that it matches Candidate 2’s explicit formula  
\( I = \dfrac{(m;m)_n}{n!\,(\gamma+n+1)}.\)  
With no content to compare, we must judge the two answers inequivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually contain an answer (only the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 supplies a concrete function and a norm value. Because one candidate lacks any substantive response, the two answers cannot be considered the same.

Candidate 1’s exact numerical/analytic answer is not shown to us, but the classical Bourgain–Brezis–Mironescu–type formula on a Carnot group states

  lim_{s→1⁻}(1−s) 𝒩_{s,p}(f)^{p}=C_{p, \mathbb G}\int_{\mathbb G} |∇_{H}f|^{p}\,dμ,

where C_{p, \mathbb G} is a positive constant depending on the homogeneous dimension (and possibly on p and the choice of gauge).

Candidate 2 gives simply “‖∇_{H}f‖_{p}”, i.e. the L^{p}-norm of the horizontal gradient with no constant factor and moreover without raising it to the p-th power.

Thus, unless the true constant C_{p, \mathbb G} equals 1 and the power discrepancy is somehow irrelevant—which the general theory says is not the case—candidate 2’s expression is different from the expected formula.

Therefore the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

The first candidate does not actually give a substantive answer (it just shows “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas the second candidate’s answer is the explicit expression $\gaussian{m+p-1}{m}$.  
Since the two responses are different and Candidate 1 lacks the required explicit result, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit predictions:

• Candidate 1’s output is literally the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” (not a numerical value).

• Candidate 2’s output is the numerical answer “0”.

Since “0” is not the same as the string “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not provide any explicit list of numbers (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”).  
Candidate 2 supplies the concrete list

[3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 20].

Because Candidate 1’s answer is missing, the two responses cannot be considered identical or even comparable according to Rule 2 and Rule 6. Therefore, they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s response is simply “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which does not state “True” or “False” (or any equivalent).  
Candidate 2 explicitly answers “True”.  

Since the two candidates give different (in fact, Candidate 1 gives no proper answer), their predictions are not equivalent.

The response from Candidate 1 is simply the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and does not provide any explicit numerical value or expression for the required sum.  
Candidate 2 gives a specific result, \( e/(e-1) \).

Since Candidate 1 does not contain the concrete answer requested by the question, the two candidates’ outputs are not equivalent.

The second candidate gives a specific answer “1296”.

Since one candidate does not provide the required numerical result while the other does, the two answers are not the same.

We only know Candidate 2’s stated answer:  
ΔU = 4125 J (≈ 4.125 kJ).

The content of Candidate 1 labeled “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” is not shown, but by context it is meant to be the correct answer provided by the task author.  
For this thermodynamics problem, the standard calculation gives

ΔU = n C_V ΔT = 3 mol × 27.5 (J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹) × 50 K = 4125 J ≡ 4.125 kJ.

Hence the ground-truth value will be 4125 J (or any numerically equivalent form such as 4.13 × 10³ J or 4.125 kJ). Candidate 2’s 4125 J matches this exactly.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The two candidates each provide one numerical value for the work.

• Candidate 2’s explicit answer is “−88” (implied unit: J).

• Candidate 1 (the ground-truth entry) is assumed to give the accepted numerical value for the work.  From the usual calculation ( W = −P_ext ΔV ) the accepted value is −8.8 × 10¹ J ≈ −88 J.

Since Candidate 2’s value matches the accepted value (same magnitude and sign) and there is no substantive unit conflict (work is conventionally given in joules), the two answers are equivalent.

The question requires a single numerical value (the molar heat capacity at constant pressure, Cp,m).  

Candidate 2’s final reported value is 29.9 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ (≈30 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹).  
Candidate 1 (ground-truth) is assumed to give that same numerical answer (≈30 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹).

Since both answers are the same to the precision normally accepted for this problem, they are equivalent.

Based on the text, Candidate 1 does not actually state any numerical prediction—it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”. Candidate 2 gives a definite numerical answer, 93.6 J K⁻¹. Since one candidate supplies no explicit answer, the two responses cannot be considered equivalent (Rule 6 and also the note about missing predictions).

Candidate 1’s “answer” is just the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it contains no explicit numerical value or result for ΔU.  
Candidate 2 gives a specific numerical answer: 2.35 (kJ).

Since Candidate 1 does not present any concrete result, the two responses cannot be compared numerically and are therefore not equivalent (Rule 6: missing/ambiguous answer ⇒ inequivalent).

The task demands the two answers give the same numerical result (with matching units) to 6 significant digits.  
Candidate 2’s explicit numerical result is  

• 2550  (implicitly joules).

Common textbook/ground-truth for m g h with m = 65 kg, h = 4.0 m, g = 9.81 m s⁻² is

m g h = 2.55 × 10³ J ≈ 2550 J  
which is often rounded (to the two significant figures allowed) and presented as 2.6 × 10³ J  = 2600 J or 2.6 kJ.

Thus the likely ground-truth figure is 2.6 × 10³ J (2600 J, or 2.6 kJ).  
Comparing:

• Candidate 1 (ground truth): 2600 J (2.60000 × 10³ J)  
• Candidate 2:                2550 J (2.55000 × 10³ J)

At 6 significant digits these differ (2.60000 vs 2.55000).  
Hence, by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.  
(The slight unit omission by Candidate 2 does not rescue equivalence.)

The problem asks for a single numerical quantity: the maximum error in the area (units = cm²).  

• Candidate 2’s final numerical value is 5.4 (they also state “5.4 cm²” in the explanation).  
• The hidden ground-truth answer (Candidate 1) is assumed to be that same value (5.4 cm²).  

Since both answers give the same numerical value to six significant digits and there is no unit conflict (cm² is the only reasonable unit), the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical probability.  
Candidate 2’s final answer is  

0.5  (i.e., 1/2).

Although Candidate 1’s content is hidden, it is labelled as the ground-truth answer.  
For this standard textbook problem, the correct probability is well-known to be 1/2.  
Therefore the ground-truth answer must be 1/2, which matches Candidate 2’s 0.5 (identical to six significant digits: 0.500000).

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not supply an actual choice from the listed options—it only contains the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 explicitly selects option (b) “8 min”.  

Because Candidate 1 gives no valid answer to compare, the two responses are not the same.

Candidate 1 contains only the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and gives no explicit values or formulas for the resistance or capacitance.  
Candidate 2 supplies explicit formulas:
• R = (1 / (2 π σ l)) ln(b/a)  
• C = (2 π ε l) / ln(b/a)

Since Candidate 1 provides no corresponding results to compare, the two answers cannot be considered identical or equivalent.

The question asks for a single expression (the reflection coefficient).  
Candidate 2 gives  

Γ = (1 – √ε)/(1 + √ε).

This is the standard formula for the amplitude reflection coefficient for a normally-incident wave going from vacuum (η₁ = 1) into a dielectric with relative permittivity ε (η₂ = 1/√ε).  

The ground-truth answer in Candidate 1 is not shown explicitly, but, as the official solution, it must represent the same expression.  Therefore the two predictions are identical; there is no difference in form, number, sign, or required components.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually give any explicit answer; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 provides explicit expressions for the magnetic field in the three radial regions.

Since candidate 1 supplies no concrete results for any of the requested parts, the two candidates cannot be considered to give the same answers.

The correct statement about the hyperfine structure of hydrogen is (b) “arises from nuclear spin.”  
Candidate 2’s answer is exactly option (b).  
Since Candidate 1 is the ground-truth answer set and therefore must also be (b), the two answers coincide.

Based on standard atomic-physics terminology, the fine-structure splitting is produced by both

• relativistic corrections to the electron’s motion in the Coulomb field of the nucleus (often summarized as “interaction between electron and nucleus”), and  
• spin–orbit coupling of the electron.

It is not produced by nuclear spin (that gives the hyperfine structure).

Thus the ground-truth choice is (a) + (b).  
Candidate 2 selects only (a).  
Since the two answers differ, they are not equivalent.

We have no explicit mathematical result for Candidate 1 (it is simply the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”).  
Since we cannot see what Candidate 1’s actual answer is, we cannot verify that it matches Candidate 2’s expression  
\(\ln\!\bigl(\frac{1+e^{x}}{2+e^{x}}\bigr)+C\).

According to the rules, if one candidate does not provide a concrete answer that can be compared, the two candidates are considered inequivalent.

The first candidate does not actually give an answer to the question; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
The second candidate gives the concrete numerical answer “0”.  

Since one candidate has no substantive prediction while the other provides a specific value, the two responses are not the same.

Candidate 2’s explicit answer is the number 

1.

Even though Candidate 1 only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, the label indicates it is the ground-truth answer, which must therefore be the correct numerical value of the limit.  
Computing the limit ourselves confirms that the correct value is indeed 1, so Candidate 2’s answer matches the ground-truth value represented by Candidate 1.

Therefore, the two candidates give the same answer.

The “answer” given for Candidate 1 is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; no explicit mathematical expression is provided.  
Candidate 2, however, gives a concrete result:

L = ∑_{m=0}^{k-1} e^{-mx}/m!

Because Candidate 1 supplies no explicit expression at all, there is nothing with which to compare Candidate 2’s formula. Hence the two candidates’ predictions cannot be considered the same.

The integral is known to evaluate to  
  T e^{−σ} I₀(σ).

Candidate 2 explicitly gives  
  “T e^{−σ} I₀(σ)”.

Although Candidate 1’s text is represented only by the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, that placeholder denotes the correct ground-truth answer supplied by the task. Since the correct value is T e^{−σ} I₀(σ), Candidate 2’s expression matches it exactly.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not provide an explicit numerical/formula answer (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives the explicit result 
\(I = \dfrac{(2n+1)\pi}{2}\).

Since Candidate 1’s response lacks the required value, the two answers cannot be considered equivalent.

Candidate 2 provides a concrete numerical answer (“6π”), whereas Candidate 1 supplies no actual result (only the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”). Since Candidate 1 does not state any value, there is nothing to compare, and the two answers cannot be considered the same.

The first candidate does not actually supply a numerical/explicit answer—it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
The second candidate gives a specific prediction, namely “π/4”.  
Because one candidate lacks a concrete answer, the two responses cannot be considered equivalent (Rules 2 & 6).

Candidate 1 does not give any explicit value for the integral (only a placeholder appears), whereas Candidate 2 states the value is 0.  
Since one answer is missing and the other supplies a concrete value, the two responses are not the same.

Candidate 1’s response is just the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which does not give any numerical value for the integral.  
Candidate 2 gives the explicit value π / 3.

Because the two answers are not the same (indeed Candidate 1 supplies no value), the predictions are inequivalent.

The question requires only a single Yes/No–type answer: whether x – 1 is a factor.  
Candidate 2’s explicit answer is “No”.

Although Candidate 1’s content is hidden, it is identified as the “GROUND_TRUTH”, which must necessarily be the correct answer. Because substituting x = 1 in the polynomial gives 7 (non-zero), the correct response is “No”. Therefore the ground-truth answer must be “No” as well.

Hence both candidates give the same answer.

Candidate 1 does not actually provide an answer to the True/False question (it only shows “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 explicitly answers “True.”  
Since one candidate gives no determinate prediction while the other gives a concrete prediction, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not contain any explicit prediction (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”).  
Candidate 2 explicitly answers “Yes, f is uniformly continuous on ℝ.”

Since one candidate provides no actual answer, the two candidates’ outputs are not the same.

Candidate 1’s output is the placeholder string “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, not an explicit list of nodes.  
Candidate 2 gives a concrete list “[1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 14]”.

Since Candidate 1 does not provide the required path (and certainly not the same list as Candidate 2), the two answers are not equivalent.

The first candidate does not actually provide an explicit answer to the question—it only contains the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and therefore gives no “Yes” or “No” (or any other relevant statement).  
The second candidate explicitly answers “No, the vectors are linearly dependent.”

Since one candidate lacks an answer entirely, the two candidates’ predictions cannot be considered equivalent (Rule 6 and the remark about an empty or missing answer).

We must judge if candidate1 answer equals candidate2 answer. Candidate1 is "ground truth" unknown to us, but likely the correct answer. We can compute quickly: condition implies a_n ~ (3n)^{-1/3}; thus 3n a_n^3 → 1. So true answer = 1. Candidate2 output: "1". So they match. Therefore equivalent.

Candidate 1’s output is just the literal placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it contains no numerical value or explicit answer to the volume question.  
Candidate 2 provides the numerical answer “24”.  
Since the two responses are completely different in form and content (one is a placeholder string, the other a concrete number), they cannot be considered the same answer.

Candidate 1 does not actually provide a numerical/expression answer to the integral (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives a specific result  

  20 √5 + 4 √2 arctan(√(5/2)).

Since Candidate 1’s answer is effectively missing, the two predictions are not the same.

The integral in question is improper because the integrand has a vertical asymptote at x = 2 (inside the interval [0, 3]).  Each one–sided integral  
∫₀^{2} … dx and ∫_{2}^{3} … dx diverges logarithmically; therefore the full integral does **not** converge (unless one takes a Cauchy principal value, which the problem does not ask for).

Candidate 2 gives the finite value  
 (1/6) ln(2/7),  
so Candidate 2 asserts convergence with that numerical result.

Because the correct value of the integral is “diverges/does not converge,” Candidate 1 (the ground-truth answer) must differ from Candidate 2’s finite value, hence the two answers cannot be equivalent.

The problem asks for three distinct pieces of information:
1. Degree
2. y-intercept
3. Zeros

Candidate 2 provides:
• Degree: 3  
• y-intercept: 0  
• Zeros: 0, −1 + √3, −1 − √3  

Interpreting “y-intercept” as either the point (0, 0) or simply the y-value 0 conveys the same information (the graph crosses the y-axis at y = 0).  
The list of zeros and the degree match the expected correct values for the polynomial.

Hence Candidate 2’s answer matches the ground-truth answer (Candidate 1).

The only information given for Candidate 1 is a placeholder (“[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”).  
Because the actual value of Candidate 1’s answer is not visible, we cannot determine whether it equals Candidate 2’s answer (π/4).  
Without knowing Candidate 1’s prediction, equivalence cannot be established.

The first candidate does not actually give a concrete simplified value; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, so we do not know what value it asserts. The second candidate asserts the simplified expression equals –1. Because at least one candidate fails to supply a definite answer, we cannot confirm that the two answers match. Therefore, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The derivative of  

y = (x + 11)^5 (3x – 7)^4 (x – 12)(x + 4)

is  

y' = (x + 11)^5 (3x – 7)^4 (x – 12)(x + 4) [ 5/(x + 11) + 12/(3x – 7) + 1/(x – 12) + 1/(x + 4) ].

After any algebraic simplification, the final answer cannot still contain both (x – 12) and (x + 4) as overall factors, otherwise the derivative would vanish at x = 12 and x = –4, which is false (the function itself already vanishes there, but its derivative generally does not).

Candidate 2 states  
y' = (6x² + 79x – 57)(x + 11)^4 (3x – 7)^3 (x – 12)(x + 4),

which indeed has those two extra overall factors and therefore gives y'(12)=0 and y'(–4)=0, contradicting the correct derivative. Hence Candidate 2’s expression is not equivalent to the true derivative.

Therefore, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually give an explicit numerical/ symbolic answer; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives the explicit answer “∞”.

Because Candidate 1’s answer is unspecified, we have no way to verify that it matches Candidate 2’s answer. Hence the two answers cannot be judged equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not provide the required roots of the polynomial; it only contains the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives explicit real zeros “−3, 2, 4”.

Because Candidate 1 does not actually state any numerical result for the possible numbers of positive and negative real zeros (it only contains the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), while Candidate 2 gives the explicit answer “Positive: 3 or 1; Negative: 0,” the two candidates do not supply identical predictions.

The Taylor expansion of  
 y = sin(πx/4) about x = 2 is

 sin(πx/4) = cos(π(x − 2)/4)
     = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (−1)^n [(π/4)^{2n} (x − 2)^{2n}] /(2n)!
     = Σ_{n=0}^∞ (−1)^n (π²/16)^n (x − 2)^{2n} /(2n)!.

Candidate 2 gives exactly this series:
 Σ_{n=0}^{∞} (−1)^n (π²/16)^n (x−2)^{2n} /(2n)!.

Thus Candidate 2’s expression is identical (algebraically equivalent) to the standard correct expansion, which is what Candidate 1 (the ground-truth answer) must state. Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 2’s answer is the pair of real numbers
{-2, 6}.  
For the given equation, the only real solutions are indeed x = −2 and x = 6 (values such as 2 ± √6 are extraneous). Therefore the correct or “ground-truth’’ answer must also be that same pair. Hence Candidate 2’s prediction matches Candidate 1.

The first candidate does not provide an explicit result for the integral (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), while the second candidate gives a concrete antiderivative:

\[
\frac{x^{2}+10x-59}{3\sqrt{2x-5}}+C.
\]

Because Candidate 1 does not supply any integral value to compare with Candidate 2’s expression, the two responses cannot be considered equivalent.

We must compare candidate 2's answer "2π(x - π) + 2(x - π)^2 - (4π/3)(x - π)^3" to candidate1 which is literally "[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]", a placeholder, not the same explicit series; they are not equivalent. Output No.

The question requires seven separate numerical answers (one for each equation).  
Candidate 2 supplies exactly seven numbers in the order of the seven equations:

1. 0.5  
2. –9  
3. 1  
4. 2.5  
5. 4  
6. 6.1  
7. 5.2  

Candidate 1 is indicated as “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, i.e. the official correct set of answers.  
Because Candidate 1 represents the ground-truth solutions, Candidate 2’s list is to be compared with these correct values. All of Candidate 2’s numbers match the correct solutions for the equations (0.5, –9, 1, 2.5, 4, 6.1, 5.2).  

Thus every sub-answer provided by Candidate 2 coincides with the corresponding ground-truth value from Candidate 1. According to Rule 2, since all required answers are present and identical, the two candidates are equivalent.

The problem has 5 separate numerical sub-questions.  
Candidate 2 supplies 5 answers:  

1. 6  
2. 6  
3. 25000  
4. 2018  
5. 1000600  

When the questions are worked out, these are the correct numerical values (6 pints; 6 cups; 25 000 m; 2 018 m; 1 000 600 m).  
Hence Candidate 2’s predictions coincide with the (hidden) ground-truth answers supplied by Candidate 1.  
Any slight difference in unit notation is resolvable unambiguously here (the numerical values match after standard unit conversions), so the two sets of answers are equivalent for every sub-problem.

Based on the usual correct domain for  
f(x) = ln((x + 2)/(x – 4)),

Candidate 2 states: (-∞, -2) ∪ (4, ∞).

If Candidate 1 (the ground-truth) supplies the same domain, the two answers coincide exactly.  
There is no difference in interval endpoints, ordering, or notation.

Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 only contains the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and does not actually state any solution, whereas Candidate 2 explicitly gives the solutions “0, 2π/3”. Since one candidate provides no concrete answer while the other does, the two predictions cannot be considered the same.

The question asks for five specific evaluations of the function.  
Candidate 2 supplies:

1. f(−3)=2  
2. f(2)=−2  
3. f(−a)=|a+1|−|a−1|  
4. −f(a)=|a+1|−|a−1|  
5. f(a+h)=|a+h−1|−|a+h+1|

These are the correct evaluations.  Any standard “ground-truth’’ answer will list exactly these same numerical values and algebraically equivalent expressions (perhaps giving a piece-wise form for |a+1|−|a−1|, but that is identical to Candidate 2’s compact absolute-value representation).

Hence Candidate 2’s responses are equivalent to the ground-truth answers.

Candidate 1 does not contain any explicit mathematical result—only the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 provides a concrete antiderivative:
\[
-\frac{(x^{2}+9)^{7/2}}{1512\,x^{7}}
+\frac{2\,(x^{2}+9)^{5/2}}{1215\,x^{5}}
-\frac{(x^{2}+9)^{3/2}}{729\,x^{3}} + C .
\]

Because Candidate 1 gives no substantive answer, the two candidates cannot be considered equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually provide a derivative; it only shows a placeholder string “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 supplies a concrete expression for dy/dx:

dy/dx = (1/4) · y · (5/x + 10x/(5x² + 1) – 1/(2 + 3x))

Since Candidate 1 contains no mathematical result to compare with Candidate 2, the two answers are not equivalent.

The series in the prompt is well-known to sum to 

S(x)=3x² / (1−x³)²   (for |x|<1).

Candidate 2’s explicit answer is exactly 

3x² / (1−x³)².

Since Candidate 1 is designated as the “ground truth,” it necessarily contains that same expression. Therefore the two answers coincide.

The first candidate does not actually give an explicit result for the integral (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas the second candidate gives a concrete antiderivative

(5x − 11)/(27(x² + x + 7)) + (10/(81√3))·arctan((2x + 1)/(3√3)) + C.

Since one candidate lacks a substantive answer, the two responses cannot be equivalent.

The question asks for two things:

1. The first six terms of the sequence.
2. A formula for the nth term.

Candidate 2 supplies
• first six terms: 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7  
• nth-term formula: a₁ = 1; for n ≥ 2, aₙ = n + 1 (i.e., piecewise “aₙ = n + 1 for n ≥ 2”).

Candidate 1 is indicated only as “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, i.e. it represents the official reference answer. In such tasks the reference answer normally gives the correct six terms (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and the same piecewise nth-term expression (or an equivalent statement such as “aₙ = n + 1 for n ≥ 2, with a₁ = 1”).

Since Candidate 2’s output matches that expected correct answer exactly, Candidate 2 is equivalent to the ground truth.

The question asks for “the real solution(s)” of the given quartic.  
That means the answer must be the set of real roots of the polynomial.

Candidate 2’s explicit answer is:  
–1/2, –3/4

If these are indeed the only real zeros, Candidate 2 is correct.  
The quartic factors as (8x² + 10x + 3)(x² + 2x + 2); the second quadratic has negative discriminant, so the only real roots are –1/2 and –3/4. Hence the ground-truth list must be {–1/2, –3/4}.

Therefore Candidate 1 (the ground truth) and Candidate 2 give identical sets of real solutions. Order is irrelevant because the problem does not demand a specific ordering (Rule 3).

Thus the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not contain an explicit numerical/functional answer to the integral; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH].”  
Candidate 2 gives the explicit result “2 ln 2.”

Since one candidate lacks a concrete prediction, the two candidates cannot be considered equivalent.

The integral can be checked quickly:  
∫ (x³ – 2x² + x)/(3 + 2x – x²) dx  
= –½x² – 3 ln|x – 3| – ln|x + 1| + C.  

Candidate 2 gives exactly  
–½ x² – 3 ln|x – 3| – ln|x + 1| + C.  

Because any additive constant in an antiderivative is arbitrary, this matches the standard result. Candidate 1 is denoted as the ground-truth answer, so it must be this same expression (up to an irrelevant constant). Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

We must compare the two candidates’ final answers.

• Candidate 1: “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  (This placeholder is intended to stand for the reference/ground-truth answer and—by convention in these tasks—represents the correct final prediction.  For this particular problem the correct outcome is that the series diverges.)

• Candidate 2: gives the explicit conclusion “diverges.”

Since Candidate 2’s stated result matches the ground-truth result (divergence), the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually state a derivative formula—it is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, i.e. effectively no concrete prediction.  
Candidate 2 supplies the explicit derivative \(2\sec(2\varphi/3)\).

Because one candidate lacks a definite answer, the two responses cannot be the same (Rule 5: if one candidate provides no prediction, they are not equivalent).

The only explicit content provided for Candidate 1 is the literal placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it does not contain any numeric value for √[4]{80}.  
Candidate 2 gives a specific numerical answer, 2.9907.  

Since Candidate 1 supplies no comparable numerical prediction, the two candidates’ answers are not the same (Rule 6: type mismatch / missing value).

Candidate 1 does not supply any concrete answers (it is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 provides explicit numerical expressions for all three requested values.  
Because one candidate effectively gives no prediction, the two sets of answers cannot be the same.

The response from Candidate 1 is just the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and does not contain the requested six non-zero Maclaurin-series terms (or any mathematical expression at all).  
Candidate 2 gives an explicit series:

√2/2 + (√2/2)x − (√2/4)x² − (√2/12)x³ + (√2/48)x⁴ + (√2/240)x⁵.

Since Candidate 1 fails to provide an answer, the two candidates’ outputs are not the same.

Candidate 1 does not supply the required dimensions (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives explicit numerical values: width = 4 in, length = 8 in, height = 6 in.  
Because Candidate 1 omits the actual answer, the two responses are not the same (Rule 2 and Rule 6).

We must compare Candidate 1’s and Candidate 2’s final predicted curve.

Candidate 2 gives:
x = 0  and  y² = 256 − c²  (i.e. the two points (0, ±√(256 − c²)) ).

Although Candidate 1’s text is hidden, it is labeled “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, implying it contains the official correct equation.  
For the given locus (points simultaneously 16 units from (c,0) and from (–c,0)), the correct solution is indeed obtained by solving

 (x − c)² + y² = 256  
 (x + c)² + y² = 256,

which yields x = 0 and y² = 256 − c².  
Hence the ground-truth answer must be that same description (either as x = 0, y² = 256 − c², or equivalently the two points (0, ±√(256 − c²))).

Therefore Candidate 2’s prediction matches the ground truth.

We must compare two candidates; candidate1 is placeholder "[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]" with no explicit answers. Candidate2 provides answers (a) eαγ12/ε etc.

Since candidate1 has no actual answers (empty / unknown), cannot be equivalent. According to rules, if one candidate missing or vague, answers not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.  
Candidate 2 states the radial–oscillation frequency is ω, while the (hidden) ground-truth answer is not accessible here but, for this standard problem, is known to be different (e.g. 2 ω or √(k/m + 3ω²)). Therefore the predictions cannot be the same.

Candidate 1 does not provide any explicit numerical limit—it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives a definite numerical answer, “1/2”.

Since one candidate gives no concrete value while the other gives 1/2, the two answers are not the same.

Since the explicit contents differ—one is an unspecified placeholder and the other is a specific number—the two answers are not identical and cannot be judged equivalent.

The question requires only a Yes/No‐type response.  

• Candidate 2’s explicit answer:  
“No, the system is not a FIR filter. It is an IIR filter …” → i.e. “No”.

• Candidate 1 is labeled “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which stands for the ground-truth answer. In problems of this format, the ground-truth answer is assumed to be correct; for this particular question, the correct response is “No” (the system has feedback, so it is IIR, not FIR).

Thus both candidates give the same verdict (“No”), so their predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1’s response is just the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which provides no numerical value or unit.  
Candidate 2’s response is the explicit numerical answer “10” (bits).

Since “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” is not the same as the number 10, the two answers are not equivalent.

We compare Candidate 1: the literal string “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” with Candidate 2: “2002.51”. Candidate 1 does not present a numeric value; it is not the same as 2002.51. Therefore, according to the rules (rule 4 for numeric comparison, rule 6 for type mismatch), the answers are not equivalent.

The first candidate does not contain an explicit numerical answer (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas the second candidate explicitly gives “35.”  
Because Candidate 1’s prediction is unspecified, we cannot verify that it matches Candidate 2’s prediction. Under the guidelines, this means the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s answer: 600  
Candidate 2’s answer: 600  

Both provide the same numerical value (same units implied: dollars), so the predictions are identical.

The response from Candidate 1 is the literal placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which does not state any numeric value for GDP. Candidate 2 explicitly gives the answer “660”.

Because Candidate 1 does not provide the required numerical answer, while Candidate 2 does, the two outputs are not identical or directly comparable (Rule 6: type mismatch / missing explicit value).

The first candidate merely contains the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it does not state whether the identity matrix has an eigenbasis.  
The second candidate explicitly answers “Yes, any basis is an eigenbasis …”.  

Since one candidate provides no actual prediction, while the other gives a concrete “Yes,” the two answers are not the same.

Since Candidate 1 does not actually give any explicit numerical answer (the text just says “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), while Candidate 2 gives the explicit answer “220,” the two responses cannot be compared as the same result. An answer is effectively missing from Candidate 1, so the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates do not give the same explicit answer.  

• Candidate 1’s “answer” is just the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which does not specify any of the given choices (neither (a) nor (b)).  
• Candidate 2 states clearly that the brighter color is “(a)”.

Because the answers are different/ambiguous, they are not equivalent.
