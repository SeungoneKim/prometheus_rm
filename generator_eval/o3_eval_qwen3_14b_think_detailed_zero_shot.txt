The two candidates give completely different explicit elements of the Grothendieck–Witt ring: 

• Candidate 1:  (½)·C(2j, j)·(1 + u)

These are not the same element in general (nor even of the same rank, except for very special \(j\)). Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit elements of the Grothendieck–Witt group:

• Candidate 1: (½) C(2j, j) · (1+u)

In GW(𝔽_q) with q odd, the class 1 (rank 1) is not the same as a (generally non-integral) multiple of the hyperbolic plane (1+u), except possibly in very special or degenerate cases, and here even the coefficient is fractional. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same formula for the density when γ ∈ (0, 1], so they agree there.

For γ > 1, however, they diverge:

• Candidate 1 says the continuous part is the Marčenko–Pastur density with parameter 1/γ, i.e. it lives on  
 [(1 – 1/√γ)², (1 + 1/√γ)²].

• Candidate 2 says the continuous part is the usual Marčenko–Pastur density with parameter γ, i.e. it lives on  
 [(√γ – 1)², (√γ + 1)²].

Those two intervals (and hence the densities) are different for γ > 1, so the two answers are not the same. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different formulas for both σ′(G) and σ(G). There is no algebraic manipulation that makes the two sets of expressions coincide for general parameters a₀,…,a_α. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas:

• Candidate 1:
N₍neg₎(n, A) = 1/(2n) · Σ_{d∣n} (2^{n/d} φ(d)) + ⌊2^{n-2} + 2^{⌈n/2 – 2⌉} – (n+1)/2⌋

• Candidate 2:
N₍neg₎(n, A) = Σ_{k=1}^{n} φ(k)·2^{⌊n/k⌋}

Testing, e.g. n = 1, Candidate 1 yields 1 whereas Candidate 2 yields 2, so they cannot be the same function. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
The two expressions are not equivalent.  
For instance, at n = 1:  

• Candidate 1 gives  
 N₍neg₎(1, A) = 1.  

• Candidate 2 gives  
 N₍neg₎(1, A) = 2.

Candidate 1 writes the condition as  
∫  overline{sgn f(x)} |f(x)|^{p-1} g(x) dλ(x) = 0,  

which equals ∫ |f|^{p-2}  overline{f} g when f(x)≠0.

Candidate 2 writes  
∫ |f|^{p-2} f g dμ = 0.

• For real-valued functions, overline{f}=f, so the two integrands coincide and the two conditions are identical.  
• For complex-valued functions they differ (overline{f} vs f), and candidate 1 also implicitly uses the complex sign while candidate 2 does not. Hence the two stated conditions are not the same in general.

Because the question does not restrict f and g to be real, the two candidates cannot be considered equivalent in full generality.

2. For s outside that range

Candidate 1 gives

• Otherwise: 0.

Candidate 2 gives

Candidate 1 gives a finite explicit list of eight palindromes.  
Candidate 2 describes an infinite family of palindromes consisting only of 1’s with a single 2 in the center, of lengths 2ⁿ − 1.  

The two answers clearly list (or imply) different palindromes: e.g. Candidate 1 includes “1”, “3”, “22”, “212”, “232”, none of which fit Candidate 2’s description (except possibly “2” fits Candidate 2 but not most others), while Candidate 2 includes palindromes like “121” and “1112111” that are absent from Candidate 1. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 presents a finite, explicit list of eight palindromes.  
Candidate 2 claims the set of palindromes is an open-ended (essentially infinite) family of sequences of 1s and 2s and gives only illustrative examples, not the same eight items.

Because the scope and membership of the two answers differ, the two candidates are not giving the same prediction.

Candidate 2 gives
v(t)=∑_{j=0}^{m} c_j v_j(t)+V_h(t),
and defines V_h(t)=𝑰_{α,β,ω}^{θ} h(t) (with no series and different indices).

The two formulas differ in:
1. the range of the sum over canonical solutions (n₀−1 vs. m);
2. the definition of V_h(t).

The question asks for four specific formulas.  
Both candidates supply four formulas, but:

• Candidate 1 uses indices 2i+1, 2i+2, 2i+2, 2i+3.  
• Candidate 2 uses indices i+1, i+2, i+1, i+2.

Since 2i+1 ≠ i+1 (and likewise for the others) for general i, the corresponding formulas are different. Therefore the two candidates’ answers are not identical and hence not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different expressions for the limit.  

• Candidate 1 supplies a complicated formula involving several Gamma functions and all of the parameters m, ρ, ν, p.  
• Candidate 2 says simply mᵖ, which depends only on m and p and ignores ρ and ν.

Since these formulas are not algebraically the same for general values of the parameters, the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers are clearly different:

• Candidate 1 gives a long expression involving Γ-functions and the parameters m, ρ, ν, p.

• Candidate 2 simply states m^p (no dependence on ρ or ν).

Since candidate 1 depends on ρ and ν (and has a very different functional form) while candidate 2 does not, the two results cannot be the same for all parameter values.

Already for m = 1 (n = 2) these give 2 versus 1, so they cannot be the same.

   These are identical.

2. Columns:

     = 2^k n_0 + 2^k n_0 · k m_0 /(2 n_0)
     = 2^k n_0 + k m_0 2^{k-1}.

   The two simplified forms coincide: n_k = 2^k n_0 + k m_0 2^{k-1}.

The two proposed PDFs are clearly different.

• Candidate 2 gives the simple exponential form λe^(−λx) (with the notational confusion that it calls the parameter λ “ϖ”).

Even for the special case L = 1 the two expressions disagree (Candidate 1 gives (1/2)e^(−ϖ), not λe^(−λϖ)). Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give completely different functional forms for the PDF.

• Candidate 1 supplies a finite‐sum mixture of gamma-type terms (polynomial in ϛ times e^{−Lϛ}), not a single exponential.

These expressions are not algebraically the same (even for special values of L), so the answers are inequivalent.

The formulas for xₙ^{(E,t)} also differ fundamentally.

For a typical term, Candidate 1 contains (1 − ρ_i(g)) whereas Candidate 2 contains ρ_i(g). These expressions are not equal in general (e.g., if ρ_i(g)=1, Candidate 1 contributes 0, Candidate 2 contributes 1; if ρ_i(g)=−1, Candidate 1 contributes 2, Candidate 2 contributes −1).

The two proposed formulas are not the same.

• Candidate 1 omits the trivial character (i = 0), has the numerator “1 − ρ_i(g)” and no overall factor 1/m.

• Candidate 2 includes the i = 0 term (which makes the denominator 0 and would blow up), uses the numerator ρ_i(g), and has an additional factor 1/m out front.

Because of these structural differences (different summation range, different numerators, different prefactor, and an ill-defined i = 0 term in candidate 2), the two expressions cannot be algebraically equivalent.
The two candidates give different algebraic expressions.

Candidate 1:
 E[τ_g] = ∑_{i=1}^{m−1} (1 − ρ_i(g)) / (1 − μ̂(ρ_i))

 ∑ 1/(1−μ̂(ρ_i)) = (−m+1)∑ ρ_i(g)/(1−μ̂(ρ_i))
for every g∈G, the two formulas are not the same. In general (e.g. when g=0) they give different values, so the answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates give exactly the same formula: a sum over i=1 to m−1 of (1−ρ_i(g))/(1−μ̂(ρ_i)).  
Candidate 1 writes it explicitly as the value of E₀[τ_g]; Candidate 2 just writes the sum, but in context it is clearly meant to equal E₀[τ_g]. The mathematical expression on the right-hand side is identical in the two answers.

1 – η³  =  (1 – η) η²  =  η² – η³,

which would imply 1 = η².  This is false for generic η (it only holds at the special point η = 1, where both expressions vanish).

Candidate 1 gives

Candidate 2 gives
R(Γ(R)) = (p – 1)/2.

For these two expressions to be identical for all primes p we would need

2p √((p – 1)(p² – 2)) + (p – 2) = p² – 2,

which is clearly false (e.g., for p = 3 the left side ≈ 23.45 while the right side = 7). Thus the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different (and in one case ambiguous) prescriptions for the set of dimensions to be summed.

Candidate 1 fixes a unique arithmetic-progression pattern of dimensions:
 ℓ ≡ ⌊n/2⌋  (mod (t + 1)).

Candidate 2 only states the qualitative condition that “any two dimensions k differ by more than t,” which leaves many possible subsets of {0,…,n}; it does not pin down a single, explicit set and therefore can yield different numerical values from Candidate 1 (and even from itself, depending on which admissible subset one chooses).

Because the two expressions are not guaranteed to coincide (and Candidate 2 is under-specified), the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas.

Except for special edge cases, these expressions are not identical; generally the sum in Candidate 1 contains more than one term, whereas Candidate 2 contains exactly one term. Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2:  p n / (k + 1)

These two formulas depend on the variables p, n, a, b, and k in very different ways (exponential vs. linear in p; dependence on a and b present in Candidate 1 but absent in Candidate 2).

These two formulas are clearly different: Candidate 1 is a weighted sum of two powers of p, whereas Candidate 2 is linear in p (no exponents involving n, a, b, k inside powers). They cannot be algebraically identical for arbitrary non-negative integers a, b, k and general p. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas for the even-n case:

• Candidate 1: I_{2k} = (2k)! / 2^{2k+1} · β(2k+1)  
• Candidate 2: I_{2k} = 2 (2k)! · β(2k+1)

For any k ≥ 0, the ratio of the second expression to the first is  
[2(2k)! β]/[(2k)! 2^{2k+1} β] = 2^{2k+2} ≠ 1.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent (they differ by a factor 2^{2k+2} for every even n).

The question asks for a single numerical value (the value of the integral).

Candidate 1 gives it in closed form:
 I = (1/√2) cot⁻¹(2√2).

Numerically,
 cot⁻¹(2√2) = arctan(1/(2√2)) ≈ 0.339 837 rad,
 so I ≈ 0.707 106 78 × 0.339 837 ≈ 0.240 301.

Candidate 2 gives the number 0.224.

Comparing the two numerical values to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
 Candidate 1 ≈ 0.240301
 Candidate 2 = 0.224000

These are not equal to 6 significant digits; therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different functional forms for I(a):

• Candidate 1: I(a)=½[arcsin(1/√a)]²+½[arsinh(1/√a)]², which depends on a and tends to 0 as a→∞.  
• Candidate 2: I(a)=π²/8, a constant independent of a.

Since a-dependence differs, they cannot be the same. A quick numeric check at a=1 already shows different values (≈1.622 for Candidate 1 vs. ≈1.234 for Candidate 2).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives 
I(a) = ½[arcsin(1/√a)]² + ½[arsinh(1/√a)]², 
which varies with a.  
Candidate 2 gives the constant value I(a) = π²/8.

Since a-dependence makes the two expressions unequal for most (indeed, all but possibly coincidental) values of a, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:               \(\displaystyle \tilde{\mathbf f}(\mathbf k)= -i\,\frac{4\pi}{|\mathbf k|^{3}}\,

Comparing, Candidate 1 has an overall factor \(\dfrac{1}{|\mathbf k|^{2}}\) in front of \(\mathbf k\times\tilde{\mathbf A}\), whereas Candidate 2 has \(\dfrac{1}{|\mathbf k|^{3}}\).  
They differ by a factor of \(1/|\mathbf k|\).

Since 4r² + 4r + 1 ≠ 8r² for general r, the answers are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 1: P(r) = (2r + 1)²  
Candidate 2: P(r) = 8r

For r = 1, these give 9 and 8, respectively, so they are not the same function. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Because an indefinite integral must include an arbitrary constant, Candidate 2 omits a required element. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give

Candidate 1: π  
Candidate 2: π·[erf(eᵉ)]²

Compute erf(eᵉ):

eᵉ ≈ 15.1543.  
For x ≳ 6, erf(x) is already 0.999999999999978…, and the asymptotic estimate  
erf(x) ≈ 1 – e^{–x²}/(√π x)  
shows that at x ≈ 15 the deviation from 1 is on the order of 10⁻¹⁰⁰.  

Hence  
[erf(eᵉ)]² = 1 – O(10⁻¹⁰⁰).

Multiplying by π gives  
π·[erf(eᵉ)]² = π – O(10⁻¹⁰⁰).

To six significant digits (the standard demanded by Rule 4),
π = 3.14159  
π·[erf(eᵉ)]² = 3.14159.

They match to at least six significant digits, so according to Rule 4 the two answers are considered equivalent.

Candidate 2:  F_X(b) F_Y(b) − F_X(a) F_Y(a)

Since F_Y(b) F_X(b) = F_X(b) F_Y(b) and the subtracted terms are likewise identical, the two answers are equivalent.

= (2/3) · (1+y)^{-3/2} · [ln(1+y)+2 ln 2−2]

Candidate 2  
= (2/3) · (1+y)^{-3/2} · [ln(1+y)+2 ln 2−2]

• Candidate 2: f(a) · (m₂ − m₁)/m₂

Since ln(m₂/m₁) is not, in general, equal to (m₂ − m₁)/m₂, the results differ. (For x ≥ a both give 0, but the discrepancy for x < a is enough to make them inequivalent.)

The two candidate equations differ only in the second addend:

• Candidate 1 uses  sin(arccos(1 − c)).
• Candidate 2 uses  √(2c − c²).

Let α = arccos(1 − c).  Then cos α = 1 − c.  
Hence  sin α = √(1 − cos² α) = √(1 − (1 − c)²) = √(2c − c²).

Because c ∈ (0, 1), this square root is positive, so
sin(arccos(1 − c)) = √(2c − c²).

Therefore the two expressions
(1 − c)(π − arccos(1 − c)) + sin(arccos(1 − c))
and
(1 − c)(π − arccos(1 − c)) + √(2c − c²)
are identical, and both equal π⁄2 in the implicit equation.

Hence Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the value

Candidate 2 gives the value

If these were equal, we would need  

    π/6 · ln(2+√3) = π/3 · ln 2  
⇒  ln(2+√3) = 2 ln 2 = ln 4  
⇒  2+√3 = 4,  

which is false (2+√3 ≈ 3.73205, not 4).

Numerically:

The question asks for one integral value.  
Candidate 1 gives:  (ln²(a) – ln²(b)) / [2 (a – b)].  
Candidate 2 gives: 0.

These two expressions are not the same in general (they coincide only in special, non-generic cases like a = 1/b or a = b, the latter contradicting the “distinct” condition). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions use the identity

ln²(a) − ln²(b) = (ln a − ln b)(ln a + ln b) = ln(a/b) · ln(ab).

Hence

Candidate 1:  [ln²(a) − ln²(b)] / [2(a − b)]
  = ln(a/b) · ln(ab) / [2(a − b)]

which is exactly Candidate 2.  
Therefore the two candidates give the same result.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not mathematically identical.

Candidate 1: (ln² a − ln² b) / [2(a − b)]
= [ln(a/b) · ln(ab)] / [2(a − b)]

Candidate 2: ln(b/a) / (a − b)
= −ln(a/b) / (a − b)

Their ratio is −ln(ab)/2, which is not a constant equal to 1 for general positive distinct a and b.  
For example, with a = 1, b = 2: candidate 1 ≈ 0.2402, candidate 2 ≈ −0.6931.

Thus the two candidates are inequivalent.

The two answers give different explicit formulas:

• Candidate 1: (m / r) K₁(m r)  
• Candidate 2: (√π / r²) K_{3/2}(m r)

To see if they could be equal, write z = m r, so
 Candidate 1 · r² = z K₁(z)  
 Candidate 2 · r² = √π K_{3/2}(z).

For equality we would need z K₁(z) = √π K_{3/2}(z).  
Taking z = 1 (for a numerical check):

 z K₁(1) ≈ 0.602  
 √π K_{3/2}(1) ≈ 1.634.

These are not equal, and there is no general identity equating them. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

1/(2√π) · (μ² + x²)^(−3/4) · cos( (3/2) arctan(x/μ) )

All symbols, factors, and functions match (ordering of μ² + x² is immaterial, and tan⁻¹ = arctan). Hence the answers are equivalent.

The two answers express I differently:

Candidate 1: I = 8 G − π²/2  
Candidate 2: I = 4 G

These are the same only if 8 G − π²/2 = 4 G, i.e. if G = π²/8, but no such relation is given or implied in the problem statement. Therefore, in general the two expressions are not equal.

The two candidates give different explicit expressions for I:

Candidate 1: I = 8 G − π²⁄2  
Candidate 2: I = 4 G

These two expressions can only be equal if 8 G − π²⁄2 = 4 G, i.e. if G = π²⁄8, which is not generally true for the integral definition of G given in the problem. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give exactly the same combination of logarithmic and arctangent terms:

1. Logarithmic terms  
   • both have  (1/3) ln|x+1|  
   • both have −(1/6) ln|x²−x+1|

2. Arctangent term  
   • both have coefficient 1/√3 (since √3/3 = 1/√3)  
   • both use the argument (2x−1)/√3

Since each term matches and an arbitrary constant C is included in both answers, the two antiderivatives differ at most by a constant. Therefore they are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give:

1. a term  (1/3) ln|x+1|
2. a term –(1/6) ln|x² – x + 1|
3. an arctangent term whose coefficient is 1/√3 = √3/3 and whose argument is (2x – 1)/√3
4. an arbitrary constant C

Hence the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by a constant; they are mathematically the same antiderivative.

Both expressions are natural logarithms, and
log((2a+1)^{2a+1}(2b+1)^{2b+1}/(a+b+1)^{2(a+b+1)})
= ln((2a+1)^{2a+1}) + ln((2b+1)^{2b+1}) − ln((a+b+1)^{2(a+b+1)})
= (2a+1)ln(2a+1) + (2b+1)ln(2b+1) − 2(a+b+1)ln(a+b+1).

              = (√π Γ(n − 1/2)) / [Γ(n) |k|^{2n−1}]   (because |k|^{1−2n}=1/|k|^{2n−1})

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
π (8/3 n³ + 4 n² + 7/3 n + 1/2).

Candidate 2 simplifies to

Because Candidate 1 contains an n³ term (and different coefficients for the other powers of n) while Candidate 2 does not, they differ for almost all integer n (n ≥ 0). Hence the two predictions are inequivalent.

The question asks for two separate density functions.  
Both candidates give answers for each sub-problem, so we must compare each pair:

1. Exponential case (z ≥ 0):  
   • Candidate 1:  f_Z(z) = − 3 / (z+3)²  
   • Candidate 2:  f_Z(z) =  3 / (z+3)²  

   These differ by a minus sign; they are not the same (one is negative, one positive).

2. Normal case (all z):  
   • Both candidates give f_Z(z) = 1 / [π(1+z²)], which match.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not identical.  
Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a Γ–function expression that depends continuously on both z and the integer m and is generally non-zero for all m.

Candidate 2 gives an expression proportional to the Kronecker delta δ_{m,0}; it vanishes for every m≠0 and, even when m=0, its Γ–function dependence on z is completely different from that in Candidate 1.

Hence the two candidates cannot be the same formula.

For r < 1 (so Θ(1 − r)=1 and Θ(r − 1)=0)

• Candidate 1: I(r)=2 − (2/3) r²  
• Candidate 2: I(r)= −r + (1/3) r³

The two candidates give different expressions for \(I(r)\) in both regions \(r<1\) and \(r>1\).

• For \(0\le r<1\):
  – Candidate 1 gives \(I(r)=2-\frac{2}{3}r^{2}\).
  – Candidate 2 gives \(I(r)=-r+\frac{1}{3}r^{3}\).
  At \(r=0\), these evaluate to \(2\) and \(0\) respectively, already showing disagreement.

• For \(r>1\):
  – Candidate 1 gives \(I(r)=\frac{4}{3r}\).
  – Candidate 2 gives \(I(r)=-\frac{2}{3}\).
  These are clearly different functions of \(r\).

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions represent the same real number:

The two answers are:

Candidate 1:  log(3) − 1/4  
Candidate 2:  ln 3 − 1/4

“ln” is unambiguously the natural logarithm (base e).  
“log” without a specified base is ambiguous: in many contexts it can mean either the common logarithm (base 10) or the natural logarithm (base e). Because the base is not stated and both choices are plausible here, the quantity in Candidate 1 is not definitively equal to the natural-logarithm value given in Candidate 2.

Since this ambiguity means the two expressions cannot be assured to represent the same numerical value, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single symbolic expression:

• Candidate 1:  log(3) − 1/4  
• Candidate 2:  ln(3) − 1/4  

In standard mathematical writing for calculus problems, “log” without an explicit base denotes the natural logarithm, just as “ln” does. Hence log(3) = ln(3). After that common interpretation, the two expressions are identical, and therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates differ only in the notation for the logarithm:

• Candidate 1:  log(3) − 1/4  
• Candidate 2:  ln(3) − 1/4  

In typical mathematical contexts, “log” without an explicit base is taken to mean the natural logarithm, which is exactly “ln”. Since the rest of the expression (− 1/4) is identical, both answers represent the same real number.

• Candidate 2 states simply “v”.  In the usual identification in ℝⁿ (via the inner product) a linear functional of the form x ↦ ⟨v, x⟩ is represented by the vector v itself; hence saying “Df(0) = v” communicates the same derivative.

Subtracting 256 ⁄ 9 (~28.4444) from 64 π ⁄ 3 (~67.0206) changes the value significantly. They do not match to six significant digits (or at all).

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
(1/4) ln A + (1/16) ln π + (1/24) ln 2 − (7 ζ(3))/(32 π²).

Candidate 2 equals  
(1/12) ln A − (1/4) ln π − (1/4) ln 2 + 1/24 − ζ(3)/16.

The coefficients of ln A, ln π, ln 2, the constant term, and, especially, the ζ(3) term (π² appears in Candidate 1 but not in Candidate 2) are all different, so the two expressions cannot be identical.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1:  h(R,τ) = −c J₀[ k c √(τ² − (R/c)²) ]  
Candidate 2:  h(R,τ) = i c J₀[ k(c²τ² − R²)/c ]

1. Overall factor: −c versus i c  (−1 vs. i)  
2. Argument of J₀:  
   • Candidate 1: k √(c²τ² − R²)  
   • Candidate 2: k(c²τ² − R²)/c

The two arguments differ (square-root vs. linear) and the prefactors differ (real −1 vs. imaginary i). Therefore the two expressions cannot be the same function.

Both expressions differ only in the exponent of (−1):

(−1)^{n+1} = (−1)^{n−1+2} = (−1)^{n−1}(−1)^2 = (−1)^{n−1}·1 = (−1)^{n−1}.

Hence

(−1)^{n−1}\frac{2}{2n−1} = \frac{2(−1)^{n+1}}{2n−1}.

The two candidates give exactly the same value for every integer n.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The only difference between the two formulas is the exponent of \((-1)\):

• Candidate 1: \((-1)^{\,n-1}\dfrac{2}{2n-1}\)

• Candidate 2: \(\dfrac{2(-1)^{\,n+1}}{2n-1}\)

Since \((-1)^{\,n+1}=(-1)^{\,n-1}\cdot(-1)^2 = (-1)^{\,n-1}\cdot 1 = (-1)^{\,n-1}\),

both expressions are identical. Hence the two candidates give the same answer.

The two candidates give different numerical expressions:

Candidate 1: π² ln 2  
Candidate 2: (π² / 4) ln 2

The second is exactly one-quarter of the first, so they are not the same value.

The two answers use different units, so convert one for comparison.

1 AU ≈ 1.495978707 × 10¹¹ m

Candidate 2:  
0.592 AU × 1.495978707 × 10¹¹ m/AU ≈ 8.856 × 10¹⁰ m

Candidate 1: 8.8 × 10¹⁰ m

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 8.80000 × 10¹⁰ m  
• Candidate 2: 8.85619 × 10¹⁰ m

The numbers differ already at the third significant digit (8.80000 vs 8.85619), so they are not equal to six significant digits.

The two answers use compatible units (kilometres vs metres), so convert them to the same unit:

Candidate 1: 202 km = 202 000 m  
Candidate 2: 201 400 m

Comparing the numbers to six significant digits:

Candidate 1 → 2.02000 × 10⁵  
Candidate 2 → 2.01400 × 10⁵  

They differ starting at the third significant digit, so the answers are not equal.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 2.24 × 10⁷ s  
Convert to days: (2.24 × 10⁷ s)/(86400 s day⁻¹) ≈ 259.259 days

Candidate 2: 259 days (which can be written as 259.000 days if we pad with zeros)

Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1: 259.259  
• Candidate 2: 259.000  

They differ starting at the 4th significant digit, so they do not match to 6 significant digits. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.
The two predictions represent the same physical quantity (time) but differ numerically.

Convert Candidate 2 to seconds:
259 days × 86 400 s/day = 22 377 600 s.

Candidate 1 gives 22 400 000 s.

Express both with the same exponent and six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 2.24000 × 10⁷ s  
• Candidate 2: 2.23776 × 10⁷ s

They differ beginning with the fourth significant digit, so they are not equal to six significant digits.  
Hence, the answers are not equivalent.
The two answers are not equivalent.  

• Candidate 1: 2.24 × 10⁷ s = 22,400,000 s  
• Candidate 2: 258.83 days ≈ 22,362,912 s  

Expressed to six significant digits:  
– Candidate 1: 2.24000 × 10⁷  
– Candidate 2: 2.23629 × 10⁷  

Since these differ within the first six significant digits, the results are not the same.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical value of 48.189685 ° (explicitly in degrees).

Candidate 2 states θ = arccos(2/3) without specifying any unit.  An angle written simply as “arccos(2/3)” is normally interpreted in radians in mathematics, which equals about 0.841069 rad.  Although 0.841069 rad converts to 48.189685 °, the lack of an explicit unit creates ambiguity because the problem could reasonably accept either degrees or radians.

According to Rule 1, when one answer omits a unit and multiple units are plausible, the omission causes ambiguity, so the two answers are regarded as not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The numeric value of  

θ = arccos(2/3)  ≈ 0.84106867 rad  
which, when converted to degrees (multiply by 180/π), gives  

0.84106867 × 57.2957795 ≈ 48.18969 °.

Candidate 1’s answer is 48.189685 °, which equals this value to at least six significant digits.  
Hence both candidates refer to the same angle, so the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 1.4907.

Candidate 2 gives the exact expression 2√5 / 3, whose value is
2√5 / 3 ≈ 1.49071198499986… → 1.49071 to 6 significant digits.

Writing Candidate 1’s number with six significant digits gives 1.49070.

Comparing at six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 1.49070  
• Candidate 2: 1.49071  

The sixth significant digit differs (0 vs 1), so the two answers are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different numerical values.

Expressed to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 1.490700  
• Candidate 2: 1.490712  (since 2√5/3 ≈ 1.49071198…)

Because the values differ at the 6-significant-digit level, they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives “0.7854 s,” which is a time (period), not a frequency.  
Candidate 2 gives “4/π Hz,” i.e. ≈ 1.27324 Hz, an explicit frequency.

Although 0.7854 s is the reciprocal of 1.27324 Hz, the units supplied by Candidate 1 do not match the requested quantity (frequency). Because the answers express different physical quantities (period vs. frequency) and the question specifically asks for frequency, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical answers:

Candidate 1: 2.8108  
Candidate 2: 2 · e^{(1/√15) arctan(√15)} ≈ 2.81084 (to six significant digits).

Expressed to six significant digits,
 Candidate 1 → 2.81080  
 Candidate 2 → 2.81084

Since the digits differ at the 6-significant-digit level, the two answers are not the same according to Rule 4.

The two candidates give different numerical values for the required \(T\):

• Candidate 1: 14.5115  
• Candidate 2: 15.75 s  

Assuming the natural unit for \(t\) is seconds, both answers are directly comparable. Since 14.5115 ≠ 15.7500 (they differ well beyond 6 significant digits), the predictions are not the same.

The answers correspond to single numerical values for the same quantity (time T).

Convert both to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 3.29527  
• Candidate 2: 3.29530 (adding a trailing zero to reach six significant digits)

Comparison of the six significant digits shows a difference at the 5th/6th digit (…2 7 vs …3 0).  
Therefore, according to Rule 4 they are not identical to 6 significant digits.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives 3.29527 (no units stated).  
Candidate 2 gives 3.295 s (seconds).

Treating the missing digits in Candidate 2 as 3.29500 for six-digit comparison, we have:

• Candidate 1: 3.29527  
• Candidate 2: 3.29500

They differ beginning at the 5th decimal place, so they do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4). Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.
To compare the two answers, note:

1. Units  
   • Candidate 2 explicitly writes “s” (seconds).  
   • Candidate 1 gives just the number.  
   The problem statement doesn’t specify any alternative unit, so it is reasonable to interpret both as seconds. Therefore the unit difference does not, by itself, make them inequivalent.

2. Numerical value (Rule 4)  
   • Candidate 1: 3.29527  
   • Candidate 2: 3.2955  → 3.29550 when written to six significant digits.

   Compare to six significant digits:  
   3.29527 vs 3.29550 differ in the 5th and 6th significant digits, so the values are not identical to six significant digits.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value (the time T).  
Both candidates supply one real number.

To test equivalence, Rule 4 states that two real-number answers are considered the same only if they match to 6 significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 2.84367  (already 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 2.8438  → written with 6 significant digits: 2.84380

Comparing digit by digit:
2.84367  
2.84380  
They differ at the 5th significant digit (6 vs 8), so they do not match to 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: 4.946 → 4.94600 (to six significant digits)

Since 4.94600 ≠ 4.94616 at the 6-significant-digit level, the answers are not equivalent.

The question requires a single numerical answer (a time period).  
Both candidates give a single value measured in years, so units are consistent.

Compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1: 672.4  → 672.400  
• Candidate 2: 672.36 → 672.360  

672.400 ≠ 672.360, so the two answers differ.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different numerical values:

Candidate 1: 672.4 years

Candidate 1 provides a single numerical value (2.3613) that is independent of γ.  
Candidate 2 gives a formula t₁ = 1 + arccos(γ/2)/√(1 − γ²/4), whose value changes with γ.  
Since the two answers are not the same expression and cannot agree for all γ, they are not equivalent.
The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 provides a single numerical value: 2.3613.

• Candidate 2 provides a formula that explicitly depends on the parameter γ:
  t₁ = 1 + 2 arccos(γ/2) / √(4 − γ²).

Because Candidate 2’s result varies with γ while Candidate 1 gives one fixed number (with no stated γ value), the two answers cannot represent the same general solution. Hence they are inequivalent.

Both answers describe the same physical quantity (the decay-rate constant), but they are expressed in different units.  
• Convert Candidate 1 to “per week”:  
 0.02828 day⁻¹ × 7 days/week = 0.19796 week⁻¹.  
• Candidate 2 already gives 0.198 week⁻¹.

Now compare the two numerical values at 6 significant digits, as required:

 Candidate 1 → 0.197960 (6 s.d.)  
 Candidate 2 → 0.198000 (interpreting the given 0.198 with trailing zeros to reach 6 s.d.)

The two differ at the 4th–6th significant digits (197960 vs 198000). Therefore, under Rule 4 they do not match to 6 significant digits, so the answers are considered inequivalent.

Candidate 1: 7.136 h  
7.136 h × 60 min/h = 428.16 min

Candidate 2: 428.11 min

Compare the numbers: 428.160 (to six significant digits) vs 428.110.  
They differ already at the 5th significant digit, so they are not the same number to six-digit accuracy as required by Rule 4.

Candidate 1: 588 313 $ → 588,313.00 to 6 significant digits  
Candidate 2: $588,313.25 → 588,313.25; the first 6 significant digits are 588313

Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4), both values are 588313, so they match. Units are the same (dollars).

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates use different units, so first convert Candidate 1 from feet to inches:

0.18162 ft × 12 in/ft = 2.17944 in.

Candidate 2 gives √19 / 2 in ≈ 2.179449 in.

Express both results to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 2.17944  
• Candidate 2: 2.17945

Because the numbers differ in the sixth significant digit, the two answers are not identical to six-digit precision. Therefore, by the strict comparison rule, the two candidates are not equivalent.
To compare the two answers we convert the symbolic value in Candidate 2 to a decimal:

√19 / 24 ≈ 4.3588989435 / 24 ≈ 0.181620789…

Round both answers (or pad, if necessary) to 6 significant digits, per Rule 4:

• Candidate 1: 0.18162 ⇒ 0.181620 (6-sig-digit form)  
• Candidate 2: 0.181620789… ⇒ 0.181621 (6-sig-digit form, rounded)

The sixth significant digit differs (0 vs 1). Hence the two numerical values are not identical to 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
0.18162 ft  vs.  √19 / 24 ft

√19 / 24 ≈ 0.181620789 ft → six-significant-digit value: 0.181621  
Candidate 1 gives 0.181620 (to six significant digits, the trailing zero is assumed).  

Since 0.181620 ≠ 0.181621 at the sixth significant digit, the two answers are not identical per Rule 4.

Both candidates give a single numerical value for the speed.

Candidate 1: “2.7 10^6”  
• Interpreted conventionally in scientific notation as 2.7 × 10⁶.

Candidate 2: “2.7 × 10⁶ m/s”  
• Explicitly 2.7 × 10⁶ m/s.

Numerical comparison (Rule 4):  
2.7 × 10⁶ = 2.70000 × 10⁶ (6 significant digits)  
Both candidates match exactly.

Unit comparison (Rule 1):  
Although Candidate 1 omits the unit, the only sensible unit in context is m/s, so the omission does not introduce real ambiguity.

Candidate 1 supplies a single coordinate (2.72 L).  
Candidate 2 supplies two different coordinates, (5 – √10)L/3 ≈ 0.612574 L and (5 + √10)L/3 ≈ 2.72076 L.

1. The question calls for a single \(x\)-coordinate. Providing two distinct values therefore oversatisfies the requirement (Rule 2).
2. Even ignoring that, Candidate 1’s numeric entry matches only one of Candidate 2’s two values; the other value (≈ 0.613 L) is not included.
3. Hence the two answer sets differ.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives a single position, 2.72 L.  
Candidate 2 gives two possible positions, (5 ± √10)/3 L ≈ 2.72076 L and 0.61257 L.  
Because Candidate 2 lists an additional coordinate that Candidate 1 does not include, the two answers are not identical. According to Rule 2 and Rule 3, the candidates are therefore not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical answer with the same unit (newtons).

• Candidate 1: 8.99 10⁹ N  
(interpreted as 8.99 × 10⁹ N; the space replaces the multiplication symbol)

• Candidate 2: 8.99 × 10⁹ N

Interpreting the implicit multiplication in Candidate 1, both correspond to the value 8.99 × 10⁹ N. They match to at least six significant digits and satisfy all rules (same unit, single answer required). Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.
The two numerical answers differ:

Candidate 1: 8.99 × 10⁹ N  → 8.99000 (to six significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 8.988 × 10⁹ N → 8.98800 (to six significant digits)

Since 8.99000 ≠ 8.98800, they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates report the same numerical value, 8.99 × 10⁹ newtons (N).  
They use the same unit (N), and the slight typographical omission of the “×” sign in Candidate 1 does not change the intended value—it is clearly scientific notation.

Candidate 1 gives: 2.0 10^5 N·m²/C  
Candidate 2 gives: 2.0 × 10^5 N·m²/C

Interpreting “2.0 10^5” in Candidate 1 as the common scientific-notation shorthand “2.0 × 10^5”, both candidates present the same numerical value (2.00000 × 10^5 when written with six significant digits) and the same unit. According to Rule 1 (same units) and Rule 4 (values match to six significant digits), the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical answer (a count of electrons).  
• Candidate 1 gives 6.3 × 10¹¹.  
• Candidate 2 gives 6.25 × 10¹¹.

Both express the same unit (a plain count of electrons), so we compare the numbers directly.  
Expressed to six significant digits:

Candidate 1: 6.30000 × 10¹¹  
Candidate 2: 6.25000 × 10¹¹  

Since 6.30000 ≠ 6.25000, the two answers differ within the first six significant digits. Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: “−1.32 × 10¹³ C”

Magnitude: 1.32 × 10¹³  
Sign: negative  
Unit: coulombs

Expressed to six significant digits both are −1.32000 × 10¹³ C, so they match.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical value for the mechanical energy.

1. Units  
   • Candidate 1: –214 MJ  
   • Candidate 2: –2.14 × 10⁸ J  
   Converting Candidate 1 to joules: –214 MJ = –214 × 10⁶ J = –2.14 × 10⁸ J.  
   Therefore the units and magnitudes match.

2. Numerical comparison  
   Expressed with six significant digits, both values are –2.14000 × 10⁸ J.  
   They coincide to at least six significant digits, including the negative sign.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same physical quantity (mechanical energy):

The two candidates each give a single numerical temperature in kelvin.

Candidate 1: 5.5  10³ K  
Candidate 2: 5.5 ×10³ K  

Although Candidate 1 omits the explicit multiplication symbol, the conventional reading of “5.5 10³” in this context is “5.5 × 10³”. Both thus represent the same numerical value, 5.50000 × 10³ K = 5500 K, with identical units.

The question asks for a single numerical value (ΔrG° at 375 K).  
Both candidates give one value with the same unit (kJ mol⁻¹), so we directly compare the numbers.

Expressed to 6 significant digits:

  – Candidate 2 → 434.9 kPa = 434.900 (six-digit form)

435.000 ≠ 434.900, so the two answers are not identical to 6 significant digits.

The two candidates give numerical answers in different units:

• Candidate 1: 27 kcal mol⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 1.874445 × 10⁻¹⁹ J (per molecule)

Converting Candidate 1 to joules per molecule:

27 kcal mol⁻¹ × 4184 J kcal⁻¹ ÷ 6.02214076 × 10²³ mol⁻¹  
≈ 1.87603 × 10⁻¹⁹ J (per molecule)

Comparing this with Candidate 2’s 1.874445 × 10⁻¹⁹ J:

Candidate 1 (converted)  = 1.87603 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
Candidate 2              = 1.874445 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  

Expressed to six significant digits:  
1.87603 × 10⁻¹⁹ vs 1.87444 × 10⁻¹⁹

Both responses give a single angle.

Candidate 1: 54.7 ° (explicitly a degree value).

Candidate 2: θ = arccos(1/√3).  
• Numerically arccos(1/√3) ≈ 54.7356 ° ≈ 0.95532 rad.  
• The answer itself does not specify units; in mathematical notation arccos customarily returns a radian measure unless degrees are explicitly stated.

Even if we interpret Candidate 2 in degrees, the two numerical values differ:

54.7000 vs 54.7356 → mismatch at the 4th significant digit, so they do not coincide to the 6-significant-digit requirement (Rule 4).

If Candidate 2 is in radians, the discrepancy is far larger.

Therefore, under the strict comparison rules, the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 2.27000 × 10⁻³⁹  

They differ already at the second significant digit, so they are not equal to six significant digits. Hence, the predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates present the same numerical value for the quantum number:

• Candidate 1: 3 × 10²⁶ (implicitly “3 10^{26}” means 3 × 10²⁶).  
• Candidate 2: 3.0 × 10²⁶.

The slight difference in formatting (missing explicit multiplication symbol or extra decimal place) does not change the value. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The units are the same (J/T), so compare the numerical values.

Candidate 1: 1.61 × 10⁻²³  
Candidate 2: 1.602 × 10⁻²³

Expressed to six significant digits:

Candidate 1: 1.61000 × 10⁻²³  
Candidate 2: 1.60200 × 10⁻²³

These differ starting at the third digit, so they do not match to six significant digits.

The question asks for a single numerical value (ground-state energy) in eV.  

Both candidates supply one number in the same unit, so we compare the numerical values.

Candidate 1: ‑13.598 eV  
Candidate 2: ‑13.6 eV

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 ≈ ‑13.5980 eV  
• Candidate 2 ≈ ‑13.6000 eV  

They do not match to six significant digits (difference appears in the 4th digit), so according to Rule 4 the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: −13.598 eV  
Candidate 2: −13.6 eV

Both answers provide the same unit (electron-volts), so we only need to compare the numerical values.

Expressed to six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 → −13.59800  
• Candidate 2 → −13.60000  

Comparing digit by digit, they differ at the fourth significant digit (…59800 vs …60000). According to Rule 4, the two results must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent. Since they do not, the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers are:

Candidate 1: 1.5377 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
Candidate 2: 1.538 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Expressed to six significant digits:

Candidate 1 → 1.53770 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
Candidate 2 → 1.53800 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Comparing digit-by-digit, they differ at the 4th significant digit (7 vs. 8). Therefore they do NOT match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4, so the predictions are not equivalent.

The two answers are single numerical values with the same units (metres).

Expressed to six significant digits (filling with a 0 if needed):
• 1.53770 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
• 1.53750 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  

They differ starting at the 5th significant digit (…70 vs …50), so they are not identical to six significant digits (Rule 4). Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The numeric answers must match to 6 significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 0.00024 = 2.40000 × 10⁻⁴  
  (six-digit form: 2.40000e-4)

• Candidate 2: 1/4165 ≈ 0.0002400859 = 2.40086 × 10⁻⁴  
  (six-digit form: 2.40086e-4)

The two six-digit strings, 2.40000e-4 and 2.40086e-4, are different, so the answers are not equivalent.
The two answers represent the same type of quantity (a probability) but differ in numerical value when compared to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 0.000240000 …  
• Candidate 2: 1/4165 ≈ 0.000240060 …

Since 0.000240000 and 0.000240060 differ at the 5th–6th significant digits, the answers are not identical per Rule 4.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 0.00024 = 2.40000 × 10⁻⁴ (to six significant digits: 0.000240000)  
Candidate 2: 1/4165 ≈ 0.000240096 = 2.40096 × 10⁻⁴ (to six significant digits: 0.000240096)

Comparing the first six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 2 4 0 0 0 0  
• Candidate 2: 2 4 0 0 9 6  

They differ at the 5th significant digit (0 vs 9), so by Rule 4 the two answers are not equivalent.
The two answers are numerical probabilities.

• Candidate 1: 0.00024  
• Candidate 2: 1/4165 ≈ 0.000240096

Expressed to six significant digits:
– Candidate 1 → 0.000240000  
– Candidate 2 → 0.000240096

They differ at the 5th–6th significant digits, so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:  
1 / 108 290 ≈ 0.0000092344 = 9.23440 × 10⁻⁶ (six-digit representation: 9.23440e-6)

The question asks for a single numerical answer (a count).  
Both candidates give one number, so we compare these numbers directly.

Candidate 1: 358800  
Candidate 2: 456976  

The two values differ (358800 ≠ 456976).  
Per Rule 4, since the numbers are not equal to six significant digits (indeed, they’re not equal at all), the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates provide numerical values for the same physical quantity (collisional cross-section).

• Candidate 1: 0.318 nm²  
  → 0.318 nm² = 0.318 × (10⁻⁹ m)² = 3.18 × 10⁻¹⁹ m²

• Candidate 2: 1.01 × 10⁻¹⁹ m²

Comparing: 3.18 × 10⁻¹⁹ m² vs 1.01 × 10⁻¹⁹ m².  
They differ by more than a factor of 3 and do not match to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.
Both answers express the same quantity.

• 0.318 nm² = 0.318 × (10⁻⁹ m)² = 0.318 × 10⁻¹⁸ m² = 3.18 × 10⁻¹⁹ m²  

This exactly matches Candidate 2’s 3.18 × 10⁻¹⁹ m².

Thus the two candidates are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a definite numerical answer: −191.2 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.  
Candidate 2 states that there is insufficient data and therefore provides no numerical value.

Since one candidate supplies a specific result and the other claims the calculation cannot be completed, the answers are clearly not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different numerical values (−191.2 vs −198.7) and the units are not explicitly the same (candidate 2 omits “per mol”). They therefore do not match to six significant digits and are not clearly in the same units.

Both answers give a single numerical pressure but in different units.

• Convert Candidate 1 to kPa:  
  1.95 atm × 101.325 kPa/atm = 197.58375 kPa.

• Candidate 2 is 198.5 kPa.

Comparing the two values to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

  197.584 kPa vs 198.500 kPa → they differ in the third significant digit.

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical boiling-point value.

Candidate 1: 344 K  
Candidate 2: 344.3 K

Both answers are given in the same unit (Kelvin), so unit comparison is straightforward (Rule 1).  
Applying Rule 4, we must compare the numbers to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 344 K = 344.000 K (to 6 sig. figs.)  
• Candidate 2 → 344.3 K = 344.300 K (to 6 sig. figs.)

Because 344.000 ≠ 344.300, the two predictions do not match to six significant digits. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: 8.44 × 10³⁴ m⁻³ s⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 6.59 × 10⁹ s⁻¹ (per-molecule or per-particle)

Converting Candidate 2 to the same unit (per cubic metre) using the ideal-gas number density at 1 atm and 298 K (~2.46 × 10²⁵ m⁻³) gives ≈1.62 × 10³⁵ m⁻³ s⁻¹, which differs from 8.44 × 10³⁴ m⁻³ s⁻¹ by nearly a factor of 2 and does not match to six significant digits.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical value “5.85 10⁴” with no unit explicitly stated.  
Candidate 2 gives “5.85 × 10⁴ K,” i.e. 5.85 × 10⁴ Kelvin.

Because temperature can be expressed in more than one reasonable unit (Kelvin, °C, °F, …), omission of the unit in Candidate 1 introduces ambiguity. According to Rule 1, when such ambiguity exists the answers are considered inequivalent, even though the numerical figures match.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single numerical answer for the temperature and both specify the same unit (K).  
Numerical value in each: 0.068. Expressed to six significant digits, both are 0.068000. Thus they match exactly per Rule 4.  
No other parts of the question require multiple answers. Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give the age in different units, so we convert Candidate 1 to years:

4.86 × 10¹¹ s ÷ 3.15576 × 10⁷ s / yr ≈ 1.54004 × 10⁴ yr ≈ 15 400 yr.

Candidate 2 states 15 393 yr.

Expressed with 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 1.54000 × 10⁴ yr  
• Candidate 2 → 1.53930 × 10⁴ yr

They differ at the third significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives an age of 4.86 × 10¹¹ s.  
Converting to years (1 yr ≈ 3.15576 × 10⁷ s):

4.86 × 10¹¹ s ÷ 3.15576 × 10⁷ s/yr ≃ 15 400.4 yr.

Candidate 2 states 15 394 yr.

Expressed with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.54004 × 10⁴ yr  
• Candidate 2: 1.53940 × 10⁴ yr

The two numbers differ at the fourth significant digit, so they do NOT match to six significant digits.

Hence, the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
To compare, first convert Candidate 1 to years.

Seconds per year ≈ 3.15576 × 10⁷ s.

Candidate 1:  
4.86 × 10¹¹ s ÷ 3.15576 × 10⁷ s / yr ≈ 1.54004 × 10⁴ yr ≈ 15 400 yr.

Candidate 2: 15 388 yr.

Expressed to six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 ≈ 1.54004 × 10⁴ yr (15400.4 yr)  
Candidate 2 = 1.53880 × 10⁴ yr (15388 yr)

The two numbers differ (they do not match digit-for-digit to six significant digits).  
Hence, according to Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the age in different units:

years = 4.86 × 10¹¹ s ÷ (3.15576 × 10⁷ s / year) ≈ 1.54006 × 10⁴ years ≈ 15 400.6 years.

Expressed to six significant digits, the two answers are

• Candidate 1: 1.54006 × 10⁴  
• Candidate 2: 1.54000 × 10⁴  

They differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits, so according to Rule 4 the answers are not identical to six significant digits. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Both answers are mathematical expressions.  
Using properties of logarithms:

(5/2) ln(5/4)  
= ln[(5/4)^(5/2)]  
= ln[(25 √5)/32]

Hence

Candidate 1: ln[(25 √5)/32]  
Candidate 2: (5/2) ln(5/4)

represent exactly the same number. Therefore the two predictions are equivalent.

The two antiderivatives can be rewritten with the same trigonometric power functions for comparison.  

Candidate 1:  
ln|tan x| − (3/2) cot²x − (3/4) cot⁴x − (1/6) cot⁶x + C₁  

Candidate 2:  
ln|tan x| − (1/2) cot²x − (1/4) cot⁴x − (1/6) cot⁶x + C₂  

Subtracting the two expressions gives  
F₁ − F₂ = −cot²x − (1/2) cot⁴x + (C₁ − C₂),  
which is not a constant because it depends on x. Therefore the two expressions are not the same antiderivative up to an additive constant.

Comparison of each component:

   (identical)

2. dz/dθ

   Candidate 2: (2 − 4√3) e^{√3}

Thus every corresponding answer is the same; the candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates differ by the non-zero scalar factor θᵏ(b₀⁻¹):

• Candidate 1: gᶻ(x) = θᵏ(b₀⁻¹) · ħ̄★(x)  
• Candidate 2: gᶻ(x) = ħ̄★(x)

Unless θᵏ(b₀⁻¹) = 1 in every possible situation (which is not guaranteed), these represent different polynomials.

Because the two proposed generator polynomials differ by the (generally non-trivial) scalar θᵏ(b₀⁻¹), the answers are not identical. The problem highlights b₀, indicating that the scalar is relevant. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the expression |RAI_{2n-1}(4321)| = M_n − M_{n−2}.

Unless M_{n–2} is identically zero (which is generally not assumed), these two expressions are different. Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two proposed formulas are not the same.

Key differences:

1. Candidate 2 decides which branch to use solely from the value of C₍₀₎(T), whereas Candidate 1 never invokes C₍₀₎(T).  
2. If all coefficients C₍j₎(M) with j ≥ 2 vanish while M ≠ 0, Candidate 1 explicitly outputs rank = 1, but Candidate 2’s set “{ j | C₍j₎(M) ≠ 0 }” is empty, so its “max” is undefined.  
3. In general, Candidate 1 determines the rank by examining a cascade of conditions on C₍N₎(M) followed by C₍N−1₎(T), C₍N−2₎(T), …, whereas Candidate 2 uses either the highest non-vanishing C₍j₎(M) (if C₍₀₎(T)≠0) or half of the highest non-vanishing C₍j₎(T) otherwise. These procedures are not guaranteed to give the same output for every multivector.

Because at least one concrete situation (e.g., M ≠ 0 with all C₍j ≥ 2₎(M)=0) yields different or undefined results, the two candidates are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives a full, explicit piece-wise definition of rank(M) involving the successive vanishing or non-vanishing of the coefficients C_{(j)}(M) and C_{(j)}(T).

Candidate 2 supplies only two branches:
• N if C_{(N)}(T)≠0 (note the test uses C(T), not C(M) as in candidate 1),  
• an undefined “rank of M with C_{(N)}(M)=0” otherwise (i.e., no explicit further cases).

Thus:
1. The conditions in the first branch differ (C_{(N)}(M) vs C_{(N)}(T)).
2. Candidate 2 omits all the lower-grade cases that Candidate 1 lists explicitly.

Hence the two answers are not the same.

The problem asks for four separate residues modulo 24.  

Candidate 1 claims all four residues are 0.  
Candidate 2 gives four different residues, each depending on n and α:  
1) 9n + 18α + 4,  
2) 9n + 18α + 7,  
3) 9n + 18α + 13,  
4) 9n + 18α + 16 (all to be taken mod 24).

Since Candidate 1’s four answers (all 0) are not identical to Candidate 2’s four answers (which vary with n and α and are generally non-zero), the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

Candidate 2: F_c(z,q) = ∏_{n=1}^{∞} 1/(1 − z q^n) = 1/(z q; q)_∞

Candidate 1 contains the extra factor (-z q; q²)_∞ in the numerator, which is generally not equal to 1. Therefore the two expressions are not the same function.

The two expressions are not the same.

Candidate 1: F₁(z,q) = (−z q; q²)∞  /  (z q; q)∞

Candidate 2: F₂(z,q) = 1 / (z q; q)∞

Since (−z q; q²)∞ = ∏_{n=0}^∞ (1 + z q^{2n+1}) is generally not equal to 1, F₁(z,q) = (−z q; q²)∞ · F₂(z,q) differs from F₂(z,q). Hence the candidates give different generating functions.

Candidate 2: F_c(z,q) = ∏_{n=1}^∞ 1/(1 - z q^{n})

Candidate 1 proposes

Candidate 2 proposes  
  binom{L/k}{j} = C(n, j) u.

The two expressions differ structurally:

• Candidate 1 contains an additive part C(n, j) and a mixed term involving (1 − u) and a different binomial coefficient, whereas  
• Candidate 2 is only the product of C(n, j) with u and has no extra additive term.

For the two formulas to be identical for all n and j, the extra term in Candidate 1 would have to vanish or match the first term in every case, which is not generally true. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 list completely different families of integer quadruples.  

Examples showing the mismatch:

• Candidate 1 contains (1, 0, k, 1) for every k ≥ 2; Candidate 2 never lists any quadruple with m = 0 (except the special case n = 0, m = 1 in its own list), so these quadruples are missing from Candidate 2.

• Candidate 2 contains (1, 1, k, 1) (because it allows any x ≥ 0 in (1, 1, k, x)); Candidate 1 only allows x = 0 when m = 1, so the quadruple (1, 1, k, 1) is absent from Candidate 1.

Since each candidate includes many quadruples that the other omits, the two answers are not identical sets. Therefore, by Rule 2 / Rule 3 the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates list different sets of integer quadruples.  
For example, Candidate 1 includes (2, 1, 2, 0) (coming from the family ( n, 1, k, 0 ) with k = 2 and n = 2), whereas Candidate 2 never includes any quadruple with n = 2, m = 1, k = 2, x = 0.  
Since at least one quadruple appears in Candidate 1 but not in Candidate 2, the two answers cannot be equivalent.

Candidate 1 lists only a small finite collection of particular groups.  
Candidate 2 describes the entire class of all solvable groups whose Fitting height is ≤ 3, which is an enormous (essentially infinite) family that certainly contains far more groups than those enumerated in Candidate 1. Hence the two answers are not the same set.

Since the expressions are not algebraically the same (they even use different step sizes in the products), the answers are not equivalent for either of the two requested generating functions.

The problem asks for five explicit expressions.  
Candidate 1 provides:

1. Mₙ  
2. Mₙ  
3. Mₙ  
4. Mₙ − M_{n−2}  
5. Mₙ − M_{n−2}

Candidate 2 provides:

1. Mₙ  
2. Mₙ  
3. Mₙ  
4. M_{n−1}  
5. M_{n−2}

Items 4 and 5 differ between the two candidates (Mₙ − M_{n−2} ≠ M_{n−1}, and Mₙ − M_{n−2} ≠ M_{n−2} in general).  
Thus the two answer sets are not identical.

They differ in:

1. Polynomial degree in n (cubic vs. linear).
2. Presence of additional factors √14 and a rational coefficient.
3. Dependence on μ and ν (candidate 1 uses μⁿ and νⁿ in a fraction; candidate 2 uses only their first powers).

No algebraic manipulation can make these two expressions identical for general n, μ, ν.

2. n = 4k+1: f₁ = 4k+1 − 2k = 2k+1 and f₂ = ⌈(4k+1)/2⌉ = 2k+1 → equal.

• Candidate 1 contains a factor (2 π)^{n/2}; Candidate 2 has no π-factor at all.

• The power of 2 and β also differs:  
  – In Candidate 1 the power of (β/2) is −β n(n−1)/4 − n/2, while in Candidate 2 it is +(n−1).  
  – Candidate 2 has an overall factor 2^{β n(n−1)/2} that is absent in Candidate 1.

• The Gamma factors differ: Candidate 1 has Γ(β/2)^{−n}, whereas Candidate 2 has Γ(β/2)^{−1}.

For L > 1 the functional forms are entirely different. Even for L = 1, Candidate 1 reduces to (1/2)(1/𝒜)e^{−ϱ/𝒜}, which still differs from Candidate 2 by a factor of 1/2. Hence the two candidates do not represent the same pdf.

Candidate 1: F₁(q)=(-q²;q²)∞ / (q;q)∞

Candidate 2: F₂(q)=∏_{n=1}^{∞} 1/(1−q^{n})²

For the two candidates to be equivalent we would need  
(-q²;q²)∞ / (q;q)∞ = 1 / (q;q)∞² ⇒ (-q²;q²)∞ = 1 / (q;q)∞,
but this identity is false (their series expansions differ, e.g. the coefficients of q and q³ differ).

Hence the two answers are inequivalent.
Candidate 1 gives  
F₁(q)=(-q²;q²)∞∕(q;q)∞

Candidate 2 gives  
F₂(q)=∏_{n=1}^{∞}1∕(1−q^{2n})

Thus  

F₁(q)⁄F₂(q)= [∏_{n=1}^{∞}(1+q^{2n})] ∕ [∏_{n=1}^{∞}(1−q^{2n−1})] ,

which is not identically 1 (e.g., at q=0.1 the two sides differ). Therefore the two expressions are not the same generating function.

Recall (-q²;q²)∞ = ∏_{m=1}^∞ (1 + q^{2m}).  
Thus  F₁(q) = ∏_{m=1}^∞ (1 + q^{2m}) · 1/(q;q)∞.

Therefore the ratio of the two candidates is

F₁/F₂ = [(-q²;q²)∞ / (q;q)∞] · (q;q)∞² = (-q²;q²)∞ · (q;q)∞  
       = (∏_{m=1}^∞ (1 + q^{2m})) · (∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 - q^{n})).

This product is not identically 1 (e.g., its q–expansion begins 1 – q + …), so F₁(q) ≠ F₂(q).  

Thus the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.  
Candidate 1 lists four specific solution triples, none of which is (1, 1, 2).  
Candidate 2 provides only the single triple (1, 1, 2).

The two proposed conditions are different.

• Candidate 1 requires only that the origin lies in the convex hull of the values { \overline{f(x)} g(x) : x ∈ M_f }.  
  This can be satisfied even when some or all points in the set have non-zero real parts (e.g., containing both 1 and −1).

• Candidate 2 demands that every single value in the set itself lies on the imaginary axis, i.e., Re(\overline{f(x)} g(x)) = 0 for all x ∈ M_f.

Because Candidate 1 allows points with non-zero real parts while Candidate 2 forbids them, the two conditions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a detailed piecewise formula that depends on k (four separate cases) and involves several spectrum elements σ1, …, σk, σ_{k-1}, σ_{m-1}.  
Candidate 2 lists four expressions that (i) do not refer to k at all (only to σ_{m-1}) and (ii) are completely different algebraic forms from those in Candidate 1.

Candidate 1 names the answer only as “the distribution that lies in the intersection \(\mathcal{M}_{LD}\cap\mathcal{M}_{ED}\)” without specifying its functional form.  
Candidate 2 identifies that distribution explicitly as the (unique) exponential-family density \(q(x)=\frac{1}{Z}\exp(\lambda\phi(x))\) with \(\lambda\) chosen so that \(\mathbb{E}_q[\phi]=\mathbf{u}\).

Because Candidate 1 gives only a vague set-membership description and Candidate 2 gives a concrete functional form, the two answers are not the same under the guidelines (Candidate 1 is incomplete relative to what is asked).

• Candidate 2 is independent of m and is expressed only with ordinary rising Pochhammer symbols of γ.

Because Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are functions of different variables and have different algebraic forms, they cannot be identical in general.

The two proposed formulas are different.

• For n = 1, Candidate 1 gives  
 S₁ = Γ(a) Γ(b)/Γ(a+b).

• For n = 1, Candidate 2 gives  
 S₂ = Γ(a) Γ(b)/Γ(a+b+c).

Because these results already disagree (unless c = 0, which is not assumed), the two candidates cannot be equivalent in general.
The two expressions differ in the argument of the Γ–function that appears in the denominator of each factor of the product.

• Candidate 1 uses  Γ(a + b + (n + i − 1)c)  
• Candidate 2 uses  Γ(a + b + (i + 1)c)

Since n is fixed for the whole product, these two arguments are not the same except in special accidental cases (e.g., when n = 1 and c = 0, etc.). Therefore the two products, and hence the two proposed formulas for Sₙ(a,b,c), are generally different.

Candidate 1:

Candidate 2 (ordered list “answer 1, answer 2”):  
• answer 1: 6g  
• answer 2: 6g − 3  

Because the question itself lists the cases in the same order (first n ≡ 0 (mod 12), then n ≡ 6 (mod 12)), Candidate 2’s two answers naturally map to those two cases. The numerical expressions 6g and 6g − 3 match exactly with Candidate 1’s expressions. No units are involved, and both supply the complete pair of required answers.

Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical/counting answer (as a function of n).  

• Candidate 1 gives the constant value 1.  
• Candidate 2 gives the value 2^{2n+1}.  

These two expressions are not equal for any n ≥ 1 (except hypothetically if 2^{2n+1}=1, which never happens for positive n). Therefore, by Rule 4 (comparing numerical results) and Rule 2 (single-answer question), the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: γₚ(K_m □ K_{1,n}) = m

For m, n ≥ 3, min{ m − 1, n − 1 } is always ≤ m − 1 and therefore strictly less than m, except in impossible cases (m ≤ 1). Hence the two expressions are not equal for the domain stated in the problem.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reasoning:
1. Candidate 1 gives an exact equality with exponent \((\lambda_E - r_\infty)n + \mu p^n + \nu\).
2. Candidate 2 writes only an asymptotic relation “∼ C ⋅ p^{\lambda n + \mu p^n - \nu}”, introducing an unspecified constant \(C\), using \(\lambda\) instead of \(\lambda_E - r_\infty\), and placing \(-\nu\) in the exponent (which could be absorbed in \(C\), but this is not stated).  
3. Because Candidate 2 is not an explicit equality and the parameters do not match those in Candidate 1, the answers differ under Rule 8.

Candidate 2 states the value is “m,” i.e., the particular positive constant mentioned only as an existing lower bound (which need not equal the essential infimum—one can take a smaller m). Hence the two quantities can differ.

• Candidate 2 is only the first term of that sum: a^{\overline{ℓ}}.

They coincide only in the special case where ⌊( \overline{ℓ}-\underline{ℓ})/(t+1)⌋ = 0 (i.e., \overline{ℓ}−\underline{ℓ} < t+1). The question does not impose this restriction, so in general the two answers are different.

Candidate 1’s answer is the q-Pochhammer product  (-q; q²)_{\lceil N/2\rceil}, a non-trivial formal power series in q.  
Candidate 2’s answer is simply the constant 0.  

A non-zero product series is not identically equal to 0, so the two predictions are different.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives  
G₁(N) = (–q;q²)_{\lceil N/2\rceil} = ∏_{j=0}^{⌈N/2⌉−1}(1+q^{2j+1}).

Candidate 2 gives  
G₂(N) = ∏_{k=1}^{N} (1+ (–1)^{k mod 2} q^{1–(k mod 2)}).

For N = 1 (the simplest test case):

• G₁(1) = (–q;q²)_1 = 1+q.  
• G₂(1) = (1+ (–1)^1 q^{0}) = 1–1 = 0.

Since 1+q ≠ 0, the two formulas are not the same. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
The answers disagree on at least parts (b) and (c):

• Part (a) matches (both give #C = p^k).  
• Part (b): “p-homogeneous” ≠ “p^k-homogeneous / complete set mod p^k”.  
• Part (c): I = {j₁−1,…,j_k−1} ≠ I = {p^0,…,p^{k−1}}.

Candidate 2 lists only three of them:  
• (1, 1, 1)  
• (1, –1, 0)  
• (–1, 1, 0)

Because Candidate 2 omits (1, 1, –1), the two sets are not identical. Under Rule 2, since the problem asks for all solutions and the candidates give different lists, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 lists only  
(1, 1, 1), (1, –1, 0), and (–1, 1, 0).

• 𝓛(Q′ₙ(8,4)) = nμ + ν

• Different multiplicative factors (n! e^{x+y} vs. y).  
• Different denominators ((e^{x}+e^{y}-e^{x+y})^{n+1} vs. (e^{y}-1)).

The two candidates give different formulae:

• Candidate 2:  d + n − 1  

These expressions are not equal for general values of d and n (e.g., n = 2, d = 10 gives 6 vs. 11). Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two separate results:

1. A general formula for the probability that all m cars park on n vertices.
2. The limiting value of this probability when m = ⌊α n⌋ as n → ∞.

Candidate 1 supplies:
• General formula:  (n+1−m)/(n+1) · (1+1/n)^m  
• Limit:  (1−α) e^α

Candidate 2 supplies:
• General formula:  n! / [(n−m)! n^m]  
• Limit:  0

Comparing the general formulas:  
(n+1−m)(n+1)^{m−1}/n^m  ≠  n(n−1)…(n−m+1)/n^m in general (e.g., n=5, m=2 gives 0.96 vs 0.8).  
Hence they are different.

Comparing the limits:  (1−α)e^α ≠ 0 for α∈(0,1).

Therefore the two candidates give different answers to both sub-questions.

The two candidates assign the multiplicity 1 to different congruence classes of m mod p:

• Candidate 1: multiplicity = 1 when m ≡ 0 (mod p).  
• Candidate 2: multiplicity = 1 when m ≡ 1 (mod p).

Since 0 (mod p) and 1 (mod p) are distinct for any prime p ≥ 2, the answers are not the same. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give opposite conditions for when the multiplicity equals 1:

• Candidate 1: multiplicity = 1 when m ≡ 0 (mod p); otherwise 0.

Since these conditions are mutually exclusive, the answers are not the same.

The two proposed formulas give different values; for example, at n = 4
• Candidate 1: 4 – 2⌊(4–2)/4⌋ = 4 – 0 = 4  
• Candidate 2: ⌊2·4/3⌋ = ⌊8/3⌋ = 2  

Since they disagree (and will disagree for other n as well), the answers are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
For n = 4 (which is in the allowed range n ≥ 4):

• Candidate 1: γₜᵣ(P₄) = 4 − 2⌊(4−2)/4⌋ = 4 − 2·0 = 4  
• Candidate 2: γₜᵣ(P₄) = ⌈2·4 / 5⌉ = ⌈8/5⌉ = 2

Since 4 ≠ 2, the two formulas give different values. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions give different values even for the first admissible integer n = 4:

• Candidate 1: γ_tr(P₄) = 4  
• Candidate 2: ⌊2·4/3⌋ = ⌊8/3⌋ = 2

Since they disagree (4 ≠ 2), the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two expressions are not the same rational function. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are different rational functions.

Candidate 1: (x − x³ + x⁵)/(1 − 2x² − x⁶)  
Candidate 2: x/(1 − 2x² − 2x⁴)

Cross-multiplying to test equality gives

(x − x³ + x⁵)(1 − 2x² − 2x⁴) = x − 3x³ + x⁵ − 2x⁹,  
whereas  
x(1 − 2x² − x⁶) = x − 2x³ − x⁷.

Since these are not the same polynomial, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different rational functions.

Expanding each as a power series:

• Candidate 2: x/(1 − x²) = x + x³ + x⁵ + x⁷ + …  (all odd-power coefficients are 1).

• Candidate 1: (x⁵ − x³ + x)/(1 − 2x² − x⁶) expands to  
 x + x³ + 3x⁵ + 7x⁷ + …, so the coefficient of x⁵ (and higher) differs from Candidate 2.

Since their series (and thus the functions) are not the same, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different rational functions:

Candidate 1: (x⁵ − x³ + x)/(1 − 2x² − x⁶)

Candidate 2: x/(1 − 6x²)

Cross-multiplying to compare:

(x⁵ − x³ + x)(1 − 6x²) = −6x⁷ + 7x⁵ − 7x³ + x  
x(1 − 2x² − x⁶) = x − 2x³ − x⁷

Coefficients differ (e.g., for x³: −7 vs −2), so the two expressions are not equal. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give, respectively,

Candidate 1: Γ(γ+1) (1–m)^{–γ} / Γ_m(γ+1)

Candidate 2: Γ(γ+1) / (m; m)_γ

For the q-Gamma function one has the identity
 (m; m)_γ = (1–m)^γ Γ_m(γ+1).

Solving for 1/(m; m)_γ gives
 1/(m; m)_γ = (1–m)^{–γ} / Γ_m(γ+1).

Substituting this into Candidate 2 shows

Γ(γ+1)/(m; m)_γ = Γ(γ+1) (1–m)^{–γ} / Γ_m(γ+1),

which is exactly Candidate 1.  Hence the two expressions are mathematically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are generally different.

•  Candidate 1:  Γ(γ + 1) / Γ_m(γ + 1) · (1 – m)^ –γ  
   Using the standard identity Γ_m(n + 1) = (1 – m)^ –n (m; m)_n, this simplifies to  
   Γ(γ + 1)/(m; m)_γ.

•  Candidate 2:  Γ(γ + 1)/m^{γ + 1}.

Since (m; m)_γ = ∏_{j=1}^{γ}(1 – m^j) is not equal to m^{γ + 1} for general m and γ, the two results differ (e.g., for m = 1/2, γ = 1 they give 2 vs. 4). Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different formulas.

Subtracting Candidate 2 from Candidate 1:

[(n−3)(2−p⁺−p⁻) − 2n − 2k + 4] − [(n−3)(2−p⁺−p⁻) − (n−3)k]
= −2n − 2k + 4 + (n−3)k
= −2n + 4 + k(n−5).

This expression is not identically zero for general n and k (e.g., for n=2, k>0 it equals −3k). Therefore the two formulas are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidate expressions are not the same; when one expands and rearranges Candidate 1 it does not reduce to Candidate 2 (except possibly in very special accidental parameter choices). Hence they are inequivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different formulas:

Candidate 1: 
−2 − (n−3)(p⁺+p⁻) + 2 c₁^τ(TX)·A + CZ^τ(Γ⁺) − CZ^τ(Γ⁻) − 2k.

Candidate 2: 
(n−3) + 2 c₁^τ(TX)·A + CZ^τ(Γ⁺) − CZ^τ(Γ⁻) − k.

These differ by:
• the coefficient of k (−2k versus −k),  
• the entire term −(n−3)(p⁺+p⁻),  
• an additional constant shift (−2 versus n−3).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 states the condition  
 λ ≥ 1 + (β − α)/2.

Candidate 2 states the condition  
 λ ≤ β − α.

These are plainly different inequalities (one is a lower bound, the other an upper bound) and, except in parameter regimes impossible here (β − α ≥ 2, which cannot happen because β, α ∈ (−1,1)), they describe disjoint or empty sets of λ. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 requires  

λ ≥ 1 + (β − α)/2.

Candidate 2 requires  

λ ≤ (α − β)/2 = −(β − α)/2.

These two conditions are opposite in both direction (≥ vs ≤) and value (shifted by 1 and sign-reversed). Except for very special, generally impossible coincidences, they cannot describe the same set of λ. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

 Candidate 2: \((q^{r};\;q^{t})_{N}\)

 Candidate 2: \((-1;\;\varepsilon q^{s})_{N}\)

These expressions are clearly not the same functions of the parameters \((r,t,s,\varepsilon,N)\). Therefore the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for “the number of solutions.”

The problem asks for two distinct answers, (a) and (b).  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each supply answers to both parts, but:

Part (a):  
• Candidate 1 (after inversion) implies  dim_B U = (m₀ – 1)/(m₀ + 1).  
• Candidate 2 gives dim_B U = 1/m₀.  
These two formulas are not the same for general m₀.

Part (b):  
• Candidate 1 says dim_B U = 1.  
• Candidate 2 says dim_B U = 0.  
These values are different.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.

wₚ(Qₙ) = (1/24) n(n+1)(n+2) [4d – (3n + 5)].

Candidate 2 gives  
wₚ(Qₙ) = d(n – 2)/2.

The first expression is a quartic polynomial in n (it contains a –(3/24) n⁴ term that is independent of d), whereas the second expression is only linear in n. Therefore the two formulas cannot coincide for all admissible n and d.

These two formulas are plainly different functions of n and d; they are not algebraically identical (nor numerically equal except possibly at accidental special values). Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ only in the sign factor in front of the \(A^{N}\) term:

• Candidate 1:   coefficient =  \(-(-1)^{N}=(-1)^{N+1}\)

• Candidate 2:   coefficient =  \(+(-1)^{\,N-1}\)

Since \((-1)^{N+1}=(-1)^{N-1}\) for every integer \(N\) (the exponent changes by 2, giving the same value), the coefficients are identical.  
All other factors are the same in both formulas.

Therefore both candidates give exactly the same discriminant formula.
The two candidates give   

Candidate 1: Δ = (−1)^{N(N−1)/2} [ N^{N} B^{N−1} − (−1)^{N} (N−1)^{N−1} A^{N} ]  
Candidate 2: Δ = (−1)^{N(N+1)/2} [ A^{N}(1−N)^{N−1} + N^{N} B^{N−1} ]

First rewrite Candidate 2’s bracket:
(1−N)^{N−1}= (−1)^{N−1}(N−1)^{N−1}, so the bracket becomes
N^{N} B^{N−1} + (−1)^{N−1}(N−1)^{N−1} A^{N}.

Candidate 1’s bracket can be rewritten as
N^{N} B^{N−1} + (−1)^{N+1}(N−1)^{N−1} A^{N},
but (−1)^{N+1}= (−1)^{N−1}, so the two brackets are identical.

The difference is only in the overall prefactor:
(−1)^{N(N+1)/2} = (−1)^{N} (−1)^{N(N−1)/2}.

Thus Candidate 2 = (−1)^{N} × Candidate 1.

For even N they coincide, for odd N they differ by a minus sign.  
Since the question did not restrict N to be even, the two formulas are not universally the same.

• Candidate 2 gives:

– Candidate 2:  nₖ = 2ᵏ n₀ + m₀ k·2^{k-1}  

The two expressions for nₖ are algebraically the same (2^{k-1} k m₀ = m₀ k·2^{k-1}).

The two expressions are clearly different.

• Candidate 1:  (x¹⁰ + 2x⁸ + x⁷ + x⁶ − x⁵ − 2x⁴ + x³ + 2x² − x − 1) / (x¹⁰ + x⁸ + 2x⁶ − 4x⁴ + 4x² − 1)

  – Its denominator is a 10th-degree polynomial; its numerator is also 10th-degree.  
  – Evaluated at x = 0 it gives 1 (so the constant term of its series expansion is 1).

• Candidate 2:  x / (1 − x − x²)

  – Its denominator is quadratic; its numerator is linear.  
  – Evaluated at x = 0 it gives 0 (so the constant term of its series expansion is 0).

Because their functional forms, degrees, and even their value at x = 0 differ, they cannot represent the same generating function. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different rational functions.

• Candidate 1 evaluates to 1 at x = 0 (its numerator and denominator are both –1, so the ratio is 1).

• Candidate 2 evaluates to 0 at x = 0 (because the numerator is x).

Since the two functions already differ at x = 0, they cannot be the same generating function. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates provide different closed-form expressions:

Candidate 1:  
P₁(x) = (x¹⁰ + 2x⁸ + x⁷ + x⁶ − x⁵ − 2x⁴ + x³ + 2x² − x − 1) / (x¹⁰ + x⁸ + 2x⁶ − 4x⁴ + 4x² − 1)

Candidate 2:  
P₂(x) = x / (1 − x − x²)

These rational functions are clearly not algebraically identical (different numerator and denominator degrees and coefficients). A quick numerical check (e.g., x = 0.1) also shows P₁(x) ≠ P₂(x). Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two proposed formulas give the same values for c = 3 and 4, but already disagree for c = 5 (candidate 1 yields 10, while candidate 2 yields 4). Hence they are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: s(5)=10  
• Candidate 2: s(5)=4  

The values are different, so the two formulas are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different numerical results for most values of c (e.g., for c = 5 candidate 1 gives 10 while candidate 2 gives 2). Hence they are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different formulas for \(\bc{\infw{t}_m}{1}(n)\).

•  Candidate 1’s expressions depend only on \(m\) (they are cubic polynomials in \(m\)) and do not contain \(n\) at all, so the value is the same for every \(n\) with the same \(m\).

•  Candidate 2’s expressions depend explicitly on \(n\) (through \(n/m\) and \(\lfloor n/m \rfloor\)), so the value changes when \(n\) changes even if \(m\) is fixed.

Since the two sets of formulas cannot agree for general \(n,m\), the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates propose different expressions:

These formulas are not identical (they coincide only for very special values of k, but the question requires a general formula). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas for the number of simple chambers:

• Candidate 1: k · 2^{k−2}

These expressions are not identically equal functions of k; they coincide only at the special value k = 2 and differ for all other k. Since the question expects a single formula valid for every k, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

Candidate 2: (3^{\ell}+2)/(3^{\ell+1}+2)

Setting them equal and simplifying shows they coincide only if 3^{\ell} satisfies 3x² – x – 6 = 0, which has no solution with x = 3^{\ell} for any ℓ > 1. Hence, for the domain in question, the expressions are not equal.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different matrix forms:

  – Candidate 2 places 1’s on the super-diagonal (row i, column i+1).

• For F the situation is reversed:  
  – Candidate 1 has the non-zero entries on the super-diagonal.  
  – Candidate 2 puts them on the sub-diagonal.

Since at least one of the three requested matrices differs, the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different matrices for both E and F (their non-zero entries are located on opposite sides of the main diagonal). Therefore their overall answers are not the same.

The two formulas for ℓ(π) are clearly different.

Candidate 2 adds every ℓ(u_i) (for i = 1,…,r) and every ℓ(v_i) (for i = 1,…,r – 1), so every term appears with a positive sign.

Candidate 1 contains alternating plus and minus signs, so several ℓ(u_i) and ℓ(v_i) terms are subtracted rather than added (indeed some even cancel each other in the written pattern). Therefore the two expressions are not the same.

Taking the ratio,
 G₁ / G₂ = q^{4} (1−q)^{-2} (1+q)^{-(k+1)},

The question requires two specific numerical/algebraic answers:

Candidate 1 gives  
(i) km + d  
(ii) 0  

Candidate 2 gives

(ii) d  

These expressions clearly differ (km + d versus m − d, and 0 versus d). Hence the two candidates are not providing equivalent answers.

The two candidates are not giving the same distributions.

• Candidate 1 specifies an n-dimensional zero-mean Gaussian whose covariance matrix is (P ⁄ n) Iₙ for X and (N ⁄ n) Iₙ for Z.  
  – Per coordinate variance = P ⁄ n and N ⁄ n, respectively.  
  – Total (trace) power equals P and N.

• Candidate 2 simply says “Gaussian … with variances equal to P and N.”  
  – This wording implies the variance **per dimension** (or in the scalar case the sole variance) is P and N, not P ⁄ n and N ⁄ n.  
  – Thus, unless one interprets candidate 2 as referring to the total trace rather than per dimension (which is not stated), the two answers differ.

Therefore the predictions are inequivalent.

Candidate 1 supplies a very specific combinatorial‐looking formula with two separate sign factors and the factor 𝓛(Σ_M(P,G_•)), and in the P = Q case it collapses to 𝓛(Σ_M(P)).

Candidate 2 instead speaks of a sum of (−1)^{dim G} times an integral of Ω_P∧Ω_Q over each chain, and when P = Q the result is the integral of Ω_P∧Ω_P over P.  The objects being summed (integrals vs. 𝓛(…) terms), the sign conventions, and even the family of chains (G^{±} vs. G⁺) differ.

Both candidates describe the same F_q-algebra.

For each pair (i,j)

•  Candidate 1 replaces F_{q^{r_i}}⊗F_{q^{t_j}} by its explicit decomposition into gcd(r_i,t_j) copies of the field F_{q^{lcm(r_i,t_j)}} and therefore writes gcd(r_i,t_j) copies of the matrix algebra M_{n_i m_j}(F_{q^{lcm(r_i,t_j)}}).

•  Candidate 2 keeps the tensor product F_{q^{r_i}}⊗_{F_q}F_{q^{t_j}} in place.  But over F_q one has the well-known isomorphism 
      F_{q^{r_i}}⊗_{F_q}F_{q^{t_j}} ≅ ∏_{k=1}^{gcd(r_i,t_j)} F_{q^{lcm(r_i,t_j)}},
  so
      M_{n_i m_j}(F_{q^{r_i}}⊗F_{q^{t_j}})
      ≅ ∏_{k=1}^{gcd(r_i,t_j)} M_{n_i m_j}(F_{q^{lcm(r_i,t_j)}}).

Hence the direct product (or direct sum) appearing in Candidate 2 is exactly the same as the one written explicitly in Candidate 1.  Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

   • det(W_i^2) = (det W_i)^2,  
   • an extra determinant  det(∑_{i=1}^n \hat{δ}_i^2/τ_i).

2. Candidate 2 has none of those factors; it simply has ∏ \hat{δ}_i and ∏ det W_i (only to the first power).

Because the factors and functional forms are markedly different, the two candidates cannot be equivalent.
The two candidates give completely different expressions for det(Δ).

These expressions involve different factors (powers of –1 and 2, determinants of W_i, extra τ_i’s, δ̂_i terms, different exponents, etc.). They cannot be the same except in very special, non-generic cases not specified in the problem. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 says the value is the arithmetic expression a₁+⋯+a_{n−2} − i + n − 2.

These answers are not the same object and cannot be converted into each other. Hence they are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives a piecewise value (either 1 or 0), while Candidate 2 gives a linear-in-(a₁+⋯+a_{n−2}) expression multiplied by (n-1)(n-2). These two formulas are plainly different; they do not match for generic inputs (e.g., when a₁+⋯+a_{n−2}=i they give 1 vs. (n−1)(n−2)²). Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two formulas for the Fredholm index differ in the coefficients in front of the Euler characteristic and the first Chern class terms:

• Candidate 1 has  n χ(Σ̇)  and  2 c₁^τ(E).  
• Candidate 2 has  χ(Σ̇)  and  c₁^τ(E).

Since these coefficients are not the same (unless special choices like n=1 and a factor 2 somehow cancels, which is not stated), the two expressions are not algebraically identical. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give markedly different algebraic expressions for 𝒮(Q).

• Candidate 1 involves the quantity √(b²+4Q²) and a long rational expression in a and Q.  
• Candidate 2 depends only on √(b+1)=√(a²+Q²) and is much simpler.

Testing with a representative numerical choice (e.g. Q = 1, a ≈ 2.164) yields
 Candidate 1: 𝒮(Q) ≈ 0.772  
 Candidate 2: 𝒮(Q) ≈ 0.893,

showing the two expressions are not equal. Hence the answers are inequivalent.

The two proposed formulas are not the same.

• Candidate 1 says 
 C₍cc₎(G □ H) = max { n·C₍cc₎(G), m·C₍cc₎(H) }.

• Candidate 2 says 
 C₍cc₎(G □ H) = n·C₍cc₎(G) + m·C₍cc₎(H).

“Maximum of two numbers” and “sum of those two numbers” give different values in general (except for the special case where one of the two products is zero, which does not apply here because the graphs are non-trivial so the parameters are positive). Therefore, the candidates are inequivalent.
The two candidates give different explicit formulas:

• Candidate 1: C_{cc}(G □ H) = max{ n·C_{cc}(G),  m·C_{cc}(H) }  
• Candidate 2: C_{cc}(G □ H) = C_{cc}(G) × C_{cc}(H)

Because “max{ n·C_{cc}(G),  m·C_{cc}(H) }” is generally not equal to “C_{cc}(G) × C_{cc}(H)” for arbitrary positive integers m, n and positive parameters C_{cc}(G), C_{cc}(H), the two answers are not equivalent.

The two formulas are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: q = 1 only ⇒ inner j‐sum gives 1, so result = 1.  
• Candidate 2: (1/1) μ(1) (5 − 1)!! = 1 · 4!! = 8.

Since 1 ≠ 8, the candidates differ.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give demonstrably different expressions.  
For example, take n = 5 and d = 1 (both odd, and d divides n).  

• Candidate 1:  
  q = 1 is the only divisor.  
  μ(1) = 1, inner sum is just 1.  
  Value = 1/1 · 1 = 1.  

• Candidate 2:  
  k = 1 is the only divisor.  
  μ(1) = 1, (5)!! = 5·3·1 = 15.  
  Value = 1/1 · 15 = 15.  

Since the two formulas give different numerical results, they cannot be equivalent.

The two formulas differ in the summand.

• Candidate 1 adds 2^{\,n_\ell+1} for each relevant prime ℓ.  
• Candidate 2 adds n_\ell for each relevant prime ℓ.

Since, in general, 2^{\,n_\ell+1} ≠ n_\ell (e.g., for n_\ell = 0 we get 2 vs 0), the two expressions give different values in almost all cases.

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas for the summand that is added to λ₂(E/ℚ):

Since, in general, 2^{\,n_ℓ+1} ≠ n_ℓ (except in the trivial case n_ℓ = –1, which never occurs here because n_ℓ ≥ 0), the two expressions are not the same. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 states 
g^*(u) = f^*(u) if u·v = 0, and +∞ otherwise.

That is the same as g^* = f^* + 𝕀_L, where 𝕀_L is the indicator of the set L = {u : u·v = 0}.

Candidate 2 states 
g^* = f^* + 𝕀_L^* (the conjugate of the indicator of L).

The conjugate 𝕀_L^* is 0 on the line span{v} (vectors parallel to v) and +∞ elsewhere, not on L itself. Therefore f^* + 𝕀_L^* yields a different piecewise function than candidate 1.

Hence the two expressions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give clearly different mathematical expressions for the number of labels.

• For h = 1, Candidate 1 yields 49, whereas Candidate 2 yields 1.

Candidate 2 gives  
 (∏_{L_j^{t}} φ_i(p^{j})) / |Aut(G)|

The factors inside the products are taken at different exponents: candidate 1 uses p^{k−a_t} while candidate 2 uses p^{j}. In addition, candidate 1 has an overall extra factor p^k in front that candidate 2 lacks. Unless j is identically k−a_t for every L_j^{t} and the extra leading p^k miraculously cancels with something absent in candidate 2 (which it does not), the two expressions are different.

Motzkin numbers and Catalan numbers are distinct integer sequences (they coincide only for n = 0). Therefore the answers are not the same.

Because “Mₙ” is not explicitly defined as the Catalan number in the problem statement, the two answers cannot be assumed to coincide. Hence they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not provably giving the same quantity:

• Candidate 1 is a complicated rational–exponential expression involving \(n^3\), \(n^2\), and the term \(\frac{\mu^{\,n}-\nu^{\,n}}{\mu^{\,n}+\nu^{\,n}-2}\).  
• Candidate 2 is simply a linear term \(n(\mu+\nu)\).

These cannot be algebraically identical for all \(n,\mu,\nu\). Hence the answers are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 presents one explicit closed-form formula:
Kf(Q′ₙ(8,4)) = (32 n³ − 2 n)/3 + (36 n²√14/7)·[(μⁿ − νⁿ)/((μⁿ + νⁿ) − 2)].

Candidate 2 gives a completely different expression that involves two separate finite sums over unspecified eigenvalues λᵢ and μⱼ:
Kf(Q′ₙ(8,4)) = [n(μ + ν)/2]·(∑_{i=1}^{μ} 1/λᵢ + ∑_{j=1}^{ν} 1/μⱼ).

The forms, variables, and structures do not match, and there is no straightforward algebraic transformation that makes the two expressions identical. Therefore, according to the comparison rules, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates supply explicit but different formulas for the same requested quantity.  
Candidate 1 gives a cubic-in-n expression with additional terms containing μ and ν in a nonlinear fraction; Candidate 2 gives the simple linear expression n(μ + ν). These cannot be algebraically identical for general n, μ, ν.

The two expressions are not the same.

Example check (k = 2, l = 2):
• Candidate 1 gives (k+l−1)!! = 3!! = 3.  
• Candidate 2 gives C(4,2)·3!! / (1!!·1!!) = 6·3 / 1 = 18.

Since they yield different numbers (3 vs 18), the candidates are inequivalent.

The answers disagree on the expression for the α-divergence barycenter:

• Candidate 1 uses (∑ w_k p_k^α)^{1/α}  
• Candidate 2 uses (∑ w_k p_k^{1-α})^{1/(1-α)}

These are not the same for general α.  
(They do match for the RKL case, but both parts must coincide.)

The question asks for two explicit formulas:
1. the barycenter \(p^*_{D_\alpha}\);
2. the barycenter \(p^*_{RKL}\).

Candidate 1 gives
• \(p^*_{D_\alpha} \propto \left(\sum_{k} w_k\,p_k^{\alpha}\right)^{1/\alpha}\);
• \(p^*_{RKL} \propto \prod_{k} p_k^{w_k}\).

Candidate 2 gives
• \(p^*_{D_\alpha} \propto \left(\sum_{k} w_k\,p_k^{1-\alpha}\right)^{1/(1-\alpha)}\);
• \(p^*_{RKL} \propto \sum_{k} w_k\,p_k\).

The two expressions for \(p^*_{D_\alpha}\) are not the same for the same value of \(\alpha\) (powers and exponents differ).  
The two expressions for \(p^*_{RKL}\) are also completely different (geometric mean vs. weighted arithmetic mean).

Therefore, by Rule 2 (multiple required answers) and Rule 8 (mathematical inequivalence), the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions:

Candidate 2: 2m

These expressions are only equal when 4(m − n) = 2m, i.e. when m = 2n, which is not guaranteed by the hypotheses. Hence, in general they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both supply two explicit expressions, one for L₁ and one for L₂, so Rule 2 applies: each sub-answer must match.

L₁:
• Candidate 1:  π²(β − α)² / (π + 2ℓ)²  
• Candidate 2:  α ℓ  

These are plainly different formulas; they cannot be algebraically identical for general α, β, ℓ.

L₂:
• Candidate 1:  2π ℓ²(β − α)² / (π + 2ℓ)²  
• Candidate 2:  β ℓ  

Again, the two expressions differ.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the overall answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different symbolic expressions:

• Candidate 2:  − p_e(n)

These are not the same (except in the trivial case p_e(n)=0 for all n, which is not assumed). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different probability distributions.

Example (k = 1):
• Candidate 1: P(d = 0)=1/q, P(d = 1)=(q−1)/q.
• Candidate 2: P(d = 0)=0, P(d = 1)=1.

Since the two answers disagree already for k = 1, they cannot be equivalent.

The two candidates give different probability distributions, already evident in the case k = 1:

• Candidate 1: P(d = 0) = 1/q, P(d = 1) = (q–1)/q.  
• Candidate 2: P(d = 1) = 1, P(d ≠ 1) = 0.

Since these cannot be simultaneously true for any q > 1, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reason: Both answers have the same denominator (q; q)_∞, so equivalence would require equality of the numerators.  
Candidate 1’s numerator is (q^{1/2}; q)_∞² = ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1 − q^{n+1/2})², an infinite product.  
Candidate 2’s numerator is simply 1 − √q.  
These expressions are clearly different (the infinite product is not equal to a single linear factor), so the two candidates cannot produce the same value.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different closed-form expressions:

Candidate 1:  (q^{1/2};q)_∞^2 / (q;q)_∞  

Candidate 2:  (1 − q^{1/2}) (q;q)_∞^2  

Using the infinite-product definition (a;q)_∞ = ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−a q^{n}), one finds that these two products are not the same (their ratio is not identically 1 for |q|<1). Therefore the answers are not equivalent. 

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions  

Candidate 1: \((q^{1/2};q)_\infty^{2}/(q;q)_\infty\)

Candidate 2: \((1-q^{1/2})(q;q)_\infty^{2}\)

are products of the same \(q\)-shifted–factorial type, so the “unit” issue does not arise.  
To see whether they are equal, compare their power-series expansions at small \(q\):

• \((q;q)_\infty \approx 1-q+\dots\), hence \((q;q)_\infty^{2}\approx 1-2q+\dots\).

• \((q^{1/2};q)_\infty\approx 1-q^{1/2}+\dots\), hence \((q^{1/2};q)_\infty^{2}\approx 1-2q^{1/2}+q+\dots\).

Therefore  
Candidate 1 ≈ \(\dfrac{1-2q^{1/2}+q+\dots}{1-q+\dots}=1-2q^{1/2}+2q+\dots\).

Candidate 2 ≈ \((1-q^{1/2})(1-2q+\dots)=1-q^{1/2}-2q+\dots\).

The coefficients of \(q^{1/2}\) and \(q\) already differ, so the two series are not identical; hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two specific values (one for odd d and one for even d).  
Candidate 1: odd d → 2t + s, even d → 2t + s − 1  
Candidate 2: odd d → s,          even d → 2s − 1  

These expressions are plainly different for general t ≥ 1, s ≥ 2, so the two candidates do not match on either sub-answer.

The two candidates give completely different formulas for \(V_1(0,dy)\):

• Candidate 1: involves factors \(2^{-\alpha}\pi^{-d/2}\), \(|y|^{\alpha-d}\) and an integral \(\int_0^{|y|^{-2}-1}\ldots du\).

• Candidate 2: a simple Beta–type density \(\frac{(1+y)^{\alpha-1}(1-y)^{d-1}}{2^{\alpha+d}B(\alpha,d)}\).

These expressions have different functional dependence on \(y\) and different normalizing constants, so they cannot be equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical dollar amount.

Candidate 1: 1259.71  
Candidate 2: 1259.712 (the dollar sign is just the unit)

Convert both to 6 significant digits:

• 1259.71 already has 6 significant digits.  
• 1259.712 rounded to 6 significant digits is 1259.71 (the 7th digit “2” does not change the 6th).

Since they match exactly to 6 significant digits, the two predictions are equivalent.

The question explicitly asks for an acceleration “in m/(min²).”  
• Candidate 1 gives “−120” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “−120 m/min²,” explicitly including the required unit.

Because Candidate 1 omits the unit, there is ambiguity about what physical quantity the number refers to, while Candidate 2 clearly specifies the correct unit. Under Rule 1, this omission makes the two answers inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same numerical value, –120.  
The required unit is m / min². Candidate 2 explicitly writes the unit, while Candidate 1 omits it, but because the problem statement itself specifies that the acceleration must be expressed in m / min² and no other unit is reasonably expected, the omission does not create ambiguity. Thus both answers convey the same quantity: –120 m/min².

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a single numerical quantity (total bytes).  
Both candidates supply such a number, expressed in the same unit (bytes).

Candidate 1: 21536  
Candidate 2: 21280

These two numbers differ. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates list the eigenvalues as numbers.

– Candidate 1 supplies three values: 1, 2, 2 (multiplicity of 2 is given).
– Candidate 2 supplies only two values: 1 and 2.

For a 3 × 3 matrix one normally expects three eigenvalues counting algebraic multiplicities. Therefore multiplicity is relevant; Candidate 2 omits one occurrence of the eigenvalue 2. Under Rule 3, because the required number of answers differs and multiplicity is not matched, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 3.54 × 10⁻⁷ (unit not given)  
Candidate 2: 3.5 × 10⁻⁷ C  

1. Units  
   • Candidate 2 explicitly states coulombs (C).  
   • Candidate 1 omits the unit. Even if we assume the intended unit is coulombs, the numerical values must still match.

2. Numerical comparison (Rule 4)  
   • Express both with six significant digits and the same exponent:  
     – Candidate 1: 3.54000 × 10⁻⁷  
     – Candidate 2: 3.50000 × 10⁻⁷  
   • The mantissas differ (3.54000 vs 3.50000). They do not agree to six significant digits.

Because the numerical values are different, and there is also a unit omission in Candidate 1, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

The answers are numerical values.

Expressed to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.66667  → 0.666670  
• Candidate 2: 2/3 = 0.666666…

Comparing the two 6-digit strings:
0.666670 ≠ 0.666666

Since they do not match to 6 significant digits, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give numerical answers.

Express each to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.66667 → 0.666670  
• Candidate 2: 2/3 = 0.666667

Comparing 0.666670 vs 0.666667, they differ at the 6th significant digit.  
By Rule 4 they are therefore not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical answer 0.66667.  
Candidate 2 gives 2/3, which equals 0.666666… (repeating).

Expressing both to six significant digits for comparison (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1 → 0.666670  
• Candidate 2 → 0.666666  

The two values differ in the 5th and 6th significant digits, so they are not identical to six-significant-digit precision.

The two candidates give numerical answers.

Candidate 1: 0.363  → expressed to 6 significant digits: 0.363000

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits (Rule 4):

0.363000 ≠ 0.363380

The two candidates give three numerical roots, but the values are not identical when compared to 6 significant digits:

• First root: 53.5200 … (C1) vs 53.5290 … (C2) → differ in the 3rd decimal place.  
• Second root: 54.2500 … (C1) vs 54.2580 … (C2) → differ in the 3rd decimal place.  
• Third root: 54.7600 … (C1) vs 54.7610 … (C2) → differ in the 4th decimal place.

Because at least one discrepancy exists and Rule 4 requires agreement to 6 significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent.
The question asks for “all the roots” of the equation.  
• Candidate 1 gives three roots: [53.52, 54.25, 54.76].  
• Candidate 2 gives only one root: 53.5295.

Because the task requires multiple answers and Candidate 2 supplies fewer answers than required, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question requires three numerical roots.  
Both candidates supply three numbers, but we must compare each number up to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Root 1:  
Candidate 1 = 53.5200 (padded)  
Candidate 2 = 53.5240  
Mismatch at the 4th decimal place → not identical at 6 significant digits.

Because one root already fails the 6-significant-digit test, the entire sets are not equivalent. (The other two roots also differ similarly.)

The two candidates each provide two real numbers as the roots.  
Compute Candidate 2’s exact expressions numerically:

1. (−3 − √17)/4  
   √17 ≈ 4.123105626  
   ⇒ (−3 − 4.123105626)/4 ≈ −7.123105626/4 ≈ −1.7807764065

2. (−3 + √17)/4  
   ⇒ (1.123105626)/4 ≈ 0.2807764065

Candidate 1 gives  
[−1.7807764064, 0.2807764064]

Comparing each pair to 6 significant digits:

• −1.7807764064 vs −1.7807764065 → −1.78078 (6 s.f.) matches  
• 0.2807764064 vs 0.2807764065 → 0.280776 (6 s.f.) matches

The two candidates both give the same numerical value (2).  
Candidate 2 explicitly writes “2 s”, while Candidate 1 just writes “2”.  
Because the question asks for a signal period (a time quantity) and only one reasonable time unit is implicitly expected, the omission of the unit in Candidate 1 does not materially change the meaning: 2 (time units) ≡ 2 s.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give

• Candidate 1: “2” (no unit)  
• Candidate 2: “2 s” (explicitly seconds)

Rule 1: If a unit is omitted and multiple units could reasonably apply, the omission introduces ambiguity and the answers are not equivalent.  
Here, time could be expressed in seconds, milliseconds, etc.; therefore the lack of a unit in Candidate 1 leaves the value ambiguous, while Candidate 2 specifies seconds.

Hence the two answers are considered inequivalent.
Both answers supply the same numerical value 10.92, with Candidate 2 explicitly appending the percent sign while Candidate 1 omits it.  
In the context of the question, all rates are expressed as percentages (2.8 %, 8.6 %), so a standalone number for the “expected rate of return” is naturally interpreted as a percent. No other reasonable unit is suggested. Thus there is no real ambiguity, and both responses represent 10.92 % to the same numerical precision.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a “rate of return,” which can reasonably be expressed either as a pure percentage (e.g., 10.92 %) or as a decimal fraction (e.g., 0.1092).  

• Candidate 1: “10.92” (no unit specified)  
• Candidate 2: “10.92%” (explicitly a percentage)

Because candidate 1 omits the unit, there is ambiguity: 10.92 could mean 10.92 % or a decimal value of 10.92 (i.e., 1092 %). Under Rule 1, when multiple units are plausible and the omission creates ambiguity, the answers are considered not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates report the same numerical value, 10.92.  
Candidate 2 explicitly appends the percent sign, while Candidate 1 omits it.  
In the context of “expected rate of return,” the natural and overwhelmingly common unit is percentage.  
Because 10.92 (without a unit) corresponds to 10.92 % in this context and no alternative reasonable unit (e.g., 10.92 as a decimal fraction) fits, the two answers convey the same quantity.

The two candidates are numerical values.

Candidate 1: 7.853  
Candidate 2: (5/2) π ≈ 7.853981633…

To check equivalence we compare up to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).  
• Candidate 1, written to six significant digits, is 7.85300.  
• Candidate 2, written to six significant digits, is 7.85398.

Since 7.85300 ≠ 7.85398, the two answers do not match to six significant digits. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 1.28e-06     (unit not stated)  
Candidate 2: 1.28e-6 V/K  (explicitly in V/K)

The required answer must include a unit (V/K).  
Because Candidate 1 omits the unit, it is ambiguous whether the figure represents volts per kelvin, microvolts per kelvin, or something else. Under Rule 1, such an omission in a context where more than one plausible unit could be used makes the answers inequivalent, even though the numerical values match.

Candidate 1 gives the numeric value 1.581.  
Candidate 2 gives the expression e / (e − 1), whose numerical value is approximately 1.5819767.

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 1.581000 (missing digits implicitly unknown/zero)  
• Candidate 2: 1.58198 ≈ 1.581980

Since 1.581000 and 1.581980 differ before six-digit agreement, the two answers are not the same to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The numeric value of  

e / (e − 1) ≈ 1.58198  (to six significant digits)

Candidate 1 gives 1.581 000 (implicit to six significant digits).  
Since 1.581000 ≠ 1.58198 to six significant digits, the two answers are different.

• Candidate 2 supplies a 3-component vector: (2, ln 10 / 9, 11).

Using Rule 4, express both to six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 ⇒ −0.378900 (implicit trailing zeros)

Since 0.378900 ≠ 0.378944 at the 6-significant-digit level, the two answers are different.

Both answers represent the same numerical value:

The two candidates give numerical answers that differ:

• Candidate 1: 4.1 × 10⁻⁸  
• Candidate 2: 4.4 × 10⁻⁸  

Comparing to 6 significant digits, 4.10000… × 10⁻⁸ ≠ 4.40000… × 10⁻⁸.

Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

The problem asks for three quantities: stress, strain, and elongation.  

• Candidate 1 supplies only one value (“1.8”), without specifying which quantity it refers to.  
• Candidate 2 supplies all three required quantities (stress, strain, elongation) with explicit values and units.

Because Candidate 1 omits two of the required answers, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates are both single real numbers.  
According to Rule 4, they are equivalent only if they match to 6 significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 3.1415926  → 3.14159 (first 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 3.142       → 3.14200 (first 6 significant digits)

Since 3.14159 ≠ 3.14200, the numbers do not match to 6 significant digits.

The two candidates are numerical answers.  
According to Rule 4, we must compare them to 6 significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 3.1415926 → 3.14159 (first 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 3.1416 → 3.14160 (pad with a zero to get 6 significant digits)

The digit sequences differ (…59 vs …60), so they are not identical to 6 significant digits.

The question asks for a yes-or-no–type judgment: whether the given differential equation is exact.  

• Candidate 1 says “True,” which means the statement “the equation is exact” is true—i.e., the equation is exact.  
• Candidate 2 answers “exact,” explicitly stating the same conclusion.

Both candidates therefore assert that the differential equation is exact. They convey the same decision, so their answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1: 3.7  
Candidate 2: 3.70 m/s²

• The problem explicitly sets the unit as m/s², so only that unit is sensible.  
• Candidate 2 includes the unit; Candidate 1 omits it, but in this context the omission is not ambiguous (m/s² is the only reasonable unit).

• Numerical comparison (Rule 4):  
  3.7 expressed to six significant digits → 3.70000  
  3.70 expressed to six significant digits → 3.70000  
  They match exactly.

Thus the two predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 0.  
Although Candidate 2 explicitly writes the units “J/K” and Candidate 1 omits them, the value zero is unchanged by choice of unit; 0 J/K, 0 cal/K, etc., are all simply 0.  
The omission therefore does not create any real ambiguity for this particular value, so the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a single numerical value (the total entropy change).  
Candidate 1 gives “0” (no unit stated).  
Candidate 2 gives “0 J/K”.

Because the value 0 is the same in every possible entropy unit (0 J/K = 0 kJ/K = 0 cal/K, etc.), the omission of the unit in Candidate 1 does not create a real ambiguity. Both answers state the same numerical result.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

When both are written with six significant digits for comparison:

Candidate 1 → 4.10000 ×10³ J  
Candidate 2 → 4.12500 ×10³ J

The numbers differ beginning at the third significant digit, so they are not equal to six‐significant‐figure precision.

• Candidate 2: 21.7 kPa → 21.7000 (to six significant digits)

These do not match to six significant digits, so the answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value (the molar heat capacity at constant volume).  
Both candidates supply one numerical answer with the same units (J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹), so they are directly comparable.  
Candidate 1 gives 30, while Candidate 2 gives 21.6. These values differ well beyond 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

The units are convertible:

1 Pa · m³ = 1 J

So both candidates express an energy per mole in J mol⁻¹.

Candidate 1: −0.28 Pa m³ mol⁻¹ = −0.280000 J mol⁻¹  
Candidate 2: −0.277 J mol⁻¹ = −0.277000 J mol⁻¹

Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4), −0.280000 ≠ −0.277000. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 17 kN mol⁻¹ (= 1.70000 × 10⁴ N mol⁻¹).  
If we convert that to the force per single molecule (divide by Avogadro’s number, 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹), we obtain

1.70000 × 10⁴ N mol⁻¹ / 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹ ≈ 2.823 × 10⁻²⁰ N.

Candidate 2 states 2.85 × 10⁻²⁰ N.

Even after putting both answers in the same units, the numerical values differ (2.823 × 10⁻²⁰ vs 2.850 × 10⁻²⁰), and they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Moreover, the original units are not the same (per mole vs absolute force), so without conversion they are dimensionally different.

Hence the two predictions are NOT equivalent.

Candidate 2: 474.7 m/s → 474.700 (six significant digits: 4 7 4 7 0 0)

The problem asks for a single numerical value: the standard reaction enthalpy (unit kJ mol⁻¹).  

Candidate 1: +80 kJ mol⁻¹ → 80.0000 (to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 79.6 kJ mol⁻¹ → 79.6000 (to 6 significant digits)

Comparing the two numbers digit-by-digit to 6 significant figures (Rule 4), they differ (80.0000 vs 79.6000).  
Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question requests one numerical value (the reaction enthalpy).  
Both candidates supply a single numerical answer with the same unit (kJ mol⁻¹), so comparison is straightforward.

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 80 → 8.00000 × 10¹  
• Candidate 2: 79.6 → 7.96000 × 10¹  

The two numbers differ already in the third significant digit, so they do NOT match to six significant digits (Rule 4). Hence the answers are inequivalent.

30.0000 ≠ 29.7000, so the answers are not equivalent.

Applying Rule 4, we must compare the numbers to 6 significant digits.  
30 m/s → 30.0000  
29.7 m/s → 29.7000  

30.0000 ≠ 29.7000, so the two answers are not the same.

Compute 1800 π numerically:  
π ≈ 3.14159265358979  
1800 π ≈ 5654.86677646 ft³

Thus 1800 π = 5654.86677646 to all shown digits.  
Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4): both give 5654.87, so they match.

• Candidate 2 states 1.67 × 10¹³ Hz.

Now compare six significant digits (Rule 4):
   1.66685 × 10¹³  vs.  1.67000 × 10¹³

They differ beginning at the fourth significant digit, so they are NOT identical to six significant digits. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give answers in different units (cm⁻¹ vs. Hz). Converting Candidate 1’s 556 cm⁻¹ to frequency:

556 cm⁻¹ × (2.9979 × 10¹⁰ cm s⁻¹) ≈ 1.66683 × 10¹³ Hz

Expressing both results to six significant digits:

Candidate 1 → 1.66683 × 10¹³ Hz  
Candidate 2 → 1.67000 × 10¹³ Hz

The numbers differ beyond the second significant digit and therefore do not match to six significant digits, as required by Rule 4.

The units are effectively the same (rad m⁻¹ ≡ m⁻¹), so we compare the numbers.

Expressed with six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 1.81000 × 10¹⁰  
• Candidate 2: 1.81300 × 10¹⁰  

Since 1.81000 ≠ 1.81300 at the 6-significant-digit level, the two answers are not identical.

Both candidates give the same numerical value (1.01 × 10⁻⁵) and the same unit (meters). Interpreting the minor formatting difference in Candidate 1 (“1.01  10⁻⁵ m”) as the usual scientific-notation product, the two answers express an identical quantity. Thus, the predictions are equivalent.  

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two answers are both expressed in metres, but their numerical values differ:

Candidate 1: 1.01 × 10⁻⁵ m  
Candidate 2: 1.006 × 10⁻⁵ m  

When written with six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 1.01000 × 10⁻⁵  
• Candidate 2 → 1.00600 × 10⁻⁵  

Since 1.01000 ≠ 1.00600, the answers are not identical up to six significant digits.

Both candidates give the same numerical value for the percentage difference.

• Candidate 1: 1.25 × 10⁻³ % = 0.00125 %  
• Candidate 2: 0.00125 %

The two values are identical, so the answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
To compare the two answers we must put them in the same unit.

1 eV = 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J (exact, by definition).

Candidate 2:  
100 eV  
 = 100 × 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
 = 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁷ J.

Candidate 1:  
1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷ J.

Now compare the two results to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 2: 1.60217 × 10⁻¹⁷ J  
• Candidate 1: 1.60200 × 10⁻¹⁷ J  (zeros must be supplied to reach 6 digits)

They differ at the 5th significant digit (…2176 vs …2000).  
Since the values do not match to 6 significant digits, the two answers are, by the stated rules, not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷ J  
Candidate 2: 100 eV  

Convert Candidate 2 to joules:  
100 eV = 100 × 1.602176 × 10⁻¹⁹ J = 1.602176 × 10⁻¹⁷ J.

Now write both answers with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 1.60200 × 10⁻¹⁷ J (implicit trailing zeros)  
• Candidate 2 → 1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁷ J

Comparing digit-by-digit, they differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits (0 0 vs 1 8).  
Rule 4 requires exact agreement up to six significant digits; therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates both give the same numerical value (5.51 × 10¹⁴) with the same unit (Hz). Candidate 1 omits the explicit multiplication sign “×”, but the intended meaning “5.51 × 10¹⁴ Hz” is clear and matches Candidate 2 exactly. Hence the answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 243 pm  
Candidate 2: 2.43 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Conversion:  
1 pm = 10⁻¹² m  
243 pm = 243 × 10⁻¹² m = 2.43 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Thus both candidates give the same numerical value expressed in different but equivalent units. Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.
The units can be directly compared:

Candidate 1: 243 pm = 243 × 10⁻¹² m = 2.43 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
Candidate 2: 2.42 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Expressed with the same exponent, the numbers are:

2.43000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
2.42000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Comparing to six significant digits, they differ at the third significant digit (…43000 vs …42000). Therefore, according to Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 129 pm  
→ 129 pm = 129 × 10⁻¹² m = 1.29 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Candidate 2: 1.28 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Expressed with 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1 ≈ 1.29000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
• Candidate 2 ≈ 1.28000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  

The values differ at the third significant digit (1.29 vs 1.28).  
Hence, according to Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give the bond length in different units:

• Candidate 1: 129 pm = 129 × 10⁻¹² m = 1.29 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
• Candidate 2: 1.28 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Expressing both numbers with six significant digits for comparison:
• Candidate 1: 1.29000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
• Candidate 2: 1.28000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

They differ beginning at the third significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers are numerical values in the same unit (eV), so compare them to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

• Candidate 1: 27.211  → 27.2110 (six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 27.211396 → 27.2114 (six significant digits, rounded)

Since 27.2110 ≠ 27.2114 in the 6th significant digit, the answers do not match.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 27.211 eV  
Candidate 2: 27.21 eV  → expressed to six significant digits: 27.2100

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):
27.2110 ≠ 27.2100

Thus the two answers are not identical to six significant digits.

The two answers are numerical values with the same units, so we directly compare them:

• Candidate 1: 2.57 × 10¹¹ J  
• Candidate 2: 2.56 × 10¹¹ J

Expressed to six significant digits these are 2.57000 × 10¹¹ J and 2.56000 × 10¹¹ J, which differ at the fourth significant digit. Therefore, they are not identical to six significant digits and are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem asks for a single numerical value (minimum energy) in joules.  
Both candidates give that value in the same unit (J).

• Candidate 1: 2.57 × 10¹¹ J  
• Candidate 2: 2.56 × 10¹¹ J

Expressing both answers with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 2.57000 × 10¹¹  
• Candidate 2 → 2.56000 × 10¹¹  

They differ in the third significant digit (7 vs. 6), so by Rule 4 they are not the same to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give numerical answers in the same units (joules).  

Candidate 1: 2.57 × 10¹¹ J

Expressed to six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 → 2.57000 × 10¹¹ J  
• Candidate 2 → 2.56000 × 10¹¹ J  

Since 2.57000 ≠ 2.56000, the answers differ.

The problem requests a single numerical answer (a Δv value).  
Candidate 1 gives 5275 m/s, while Candidate 2 gives 5200 m/s.

• Same units (m/s) ⇒ Rule 1 satisfied.  
• Compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

   Candidate 1: 5.27500 × 10³ m/s  
   Candidate 2: 5.20000 × 10³ m/s  

These differ already in the first two significant digits (5.27500 vs 5.20000). Hence the answers are not identical to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates express the Δv in different units:

• Candidate 1: 5275 m/s = 5.275 km/s  
• Candidate 2: 5.31 km/s = 5310 m/s

After converting to the same unit, the numerical values are 5275 m/s and 5310 m/s.  
These differ by 35 m/s; they are not identical to six significant digits.

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1 → 1.00000 × 10³

Both candidates give exactly the same choice for each of the three sub-questions:

1. 50° for part (a)  
2. 10^{-1} (implicitly the option “10^{-1} watt/cm²”) for part (b)  
3. 10^{19} for part (c)

The slight omission of the unit in Candidate 2’s part (b) is acceptable in a multiple-choice context, since the numerical value uniquely identifies the same listed option. Therefore all three answers coincide.

The problem requires two numerical answers.  
Both candidates give the same first answer (0.51 cm), but their second answers differ:

• Candidate 1:  +290  
• Candidate 2:  –292.5  

These differ in sign (and thus numerically) and are therefore not identical. Since at least one of the required sub-answers is different, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 3 × 10⁻⁴ cm = 3 × 10⁻⁴ × 10⁻² m = 3 × 10⁻⁶ m

3 × 10⁻⁶ m ≠ 0.0125 m (they differ by over four orders of magnitude).

The problem asks for a single distance value.  
Candidate 1 gives  R² / (2 λ).  
Candidate 2 gives  R² / λ.  

They differ by a factor of 2, so the two answers are not the same.
The two answers differ by a factor of 2 ( R²/2λ  vs.  R²/λ ).  
They are therefore not the same result.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers represent the same physical quantity.

• Candidate 1: 4260 Å  = 4260 × 10⁻¹⁰ m = 4.26 × 10⁻⁷ m  
• Candidate 2: 4.26 × 10⁻⁷ m

After converting Candidate 1 to metres, both give 4.26 × 10⁻⁷ m. They match to 6 significant digits (4.26000 × 10⁻⁷ m).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two answers represent the same numerical value expressed in different units:

• Candidate 1: 4260 Å  
  1 Å = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m → 4260 Å = 4.26 × 10⁻⁷ m

• Candidate 2: 4.26 × 10⁻⁷ m

After conversion they coincide (4.26 × 10⁻⁷ m). Hence the predictions are equivalent.

(c) 2
(d) 0

Candidate 2 gives:
(a) 3.29 × 10⁻⁹ dyne-cm
(b) 2
(c) 2
(d) 2

Comparison for each sub-question:

a) 3.3 × 10⁻⁹ vs 3.29 × 10⁻⁹ are not identical; to six significant digits they differ (3.30000 vs 3.29000).

b) 0 vs 2 differ.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

Candidate 1’s general intensity formula contains explicit factors of the slit widths a and b (a², b² and 2ab terms).  
Candidate 2’s formula lacks those prefactors; it has only a single overall constant I₀ that is not defined in terms of a and b. Consequently, for a general choice of a and b (e.g., at θ = 0) the two expressions cannot be made identical with one fixed value of I₀. The same discrepancy appears in the two special-case formulas. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions for every part of the question.

1. General formula (part a):  
   • Candidate 1 has factors a²/u², b²/v² and 2ab/(uv);  
   • Candidate 2 divides only by sin²θ and contains no prefactors a² or b².  
   The two expressions are not algebraically the same.

2. Special case a = b: the resulting formulas differ by the same kinds of factors, so they are not equivalent.

3. Special case a = 0: again one formula has b²/v², the other has sin²θ in the denominator, making them nonequivalent.

Because none of the corresponding answers match, the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The problem requests four separate answers: (a), (b), (c), and (d).  
Both candidates supply four answers, so we compare each corresponding sub-answer:

(a) rₐ: Candidate 1 = √(λ L); Candidate 2 = √(λ L).  → identical.  
(b) r_b: Candidate 1 = √(2 λ L); Candidate 2 = √(2 λ L). → identical.  
(c) ratio of intensities: Candidate 1 = 4; Candidate 2 = 1. → different.  
(d) intensity with opaque disk: Candidate 1 = I_∞; Candidate 2 = 0. → different.

Because at least one sub-answer differs (in fact two do), the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both sub-parts need answers.

Sub-part (a):  
• Candidate 1: z = ω² r² / (2g)  
• Candidate 2: z = (ω² / 2g) r²  
These are algebraically identical.

Sub-part (b):  
• Candidate 1: ω = 7 rad s⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: ω ≈ 7.00 rad s⁻¹  
Numerically, 7 = 7.00; the values coincide (any trailing zeros do not change the value). Hence they agree to six significant digits.

Since each candidate supplies both required answers and the answers match in every case, the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 states that the telescope must have a radius R ≈ 0.6 m (so a diameter of ≈ 1.2 m) or, equivalently, F/f ≥ 100.

Candidate 2 states that the telescope must have a diameter D ≈ 0.63 m.

After converting to the same quantity (diameter), the two answers are 1.2 m (Candidate 1) versus 0.63 m (Candidate 2). They differ by about a factor of 2 and therefore are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The answers must be compared number-by-number to six significant digits (Rule 4).  

After converting Candidate 1’s values to nanometres:

• 4000 Å = 400.000 nm  
• 5000 Å = 500.000 nm  
• 6670 Å = 667.000 nm  

Candidate 2 gives:

• 400.000 nm  
• 500.000 nm  
• 666.670 nm  

The first two wavelengths match, but the third differs: 667.000 nm ≠ 666.670 nm at the third significant digit.  
Because at least one required number disagrees to six significant digits, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 lists three wavelengths/colors: 

1. 4000 Å = 400 nm  (violet)  
2. 5000 Å = 500 nm  (green)  
3. 6670 Å = 667 nm  (red)

Candidate 2 lists:

1. 400 nm (violet)  
2. 500 nm (green)  
3. 666.67 nm (red)

For the first two wavelengths the converted values coincide exactly.  
For the third wavelength, comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 ⇒ 667 nm = 6.67000 × 10² nm  
• Candidate 2 ⇒ 666.67 nm = 6.66670 × 10² nm  

They differ starting at the third significant digit, so they do not match to 6 significant digits. Therefore the two sets of answers are not considered equivalent under the rules.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give two numerical answers, one for charge and one for energy.  

Charge: both quote 7 × 10⁻¹¹ C → identical.  
Energy: Candidate 1 gives 2.5 × 10⁻¹² J, Candidate 2 gives 2.45 × 10⁻¹² J.  
Expressed to six significant digits these are 2.50000 × 10⁻¹² J vs 2.45000 × 10⁻¹² J, which are not the same.

The question asks for two things:  
(a) a list/brief discussion of broadening mechanisms, and  
(b) one calculated broadened width Δλ.

Candidate 1 supplies only numerical widths (0.2 Å, 0.1 Å, 0.1 Å) and no mechanisms.  
Candidate 2 supplies the mechanisms (Doppler, collisional, Zeeman) and one width (0.05 nm = 0.5 Å).

Thus:
• The required mechanism discussion is missing from Candidate 1 but present in Candidate 2.  
• The numerical width(s) differ (0.5 Å vs 0.2 Å / 0.1 Å).  

Under Rules 2 and 4 the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates differ only by the explicit factor I₀ that appears in Candidate 1 and is omitted in Candidate 2.  
Candidate 2’s “27/128” naturally represents “27/128 of the incident intensity,” i.e. (27/128) I₀. Because the question asks “How much of the intensity … is transmitted,” it is standard to express either the fractional transmission (27/128) or the transmitted intensity ((27/128) I₀). This omission therefore does not introduce real ambiguity—the numerical factor is identical.

Hence the two answers are effectively the same.

Candidate 2 supplies four wavelengths:  
423.53 nm, 480 nm, 553.85 nm, 654.55 nm  

Although the two sets are numerically close, Rule 4 requires equality up to 6 significant digits for every numerical answer.  
• 424 nm ≠ 423.530 nm to 6 significant digits  
• 554 nm ≠ 553.850 nm to 6 significant digits  
• 655 nm ≠ 654.550 nm to 6 significant digits  

Because at least one value in each unmatched pair fails the 6-digit test, the two candidate answers are not exactly identical. Therefore, according to the guidelines, the answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for four specific wavelength values.  
Both candidates supply four numerical answers in nanometres, so unit and count match.  
Comparing each corresponding value:

1. 424 nm  vs  423.53 nm → differ (424.000 vs 423.530, not identical to 6 significant digits)  
2. 480 nm  vs  480 nm  → identical  
3. 554 nm  vs  553.85 nm → differ  
4. 655 nm  vs  654.55 nm → differ  

Because at least one of the answers in the lists is not the same to 6 significant digits (Rule 4), the two candidates are not equivalent.

I(θ) = 4 I₀ cos²(π a sin θ / λ)

and gives a qualitative description for part (b): the interference fringes are washed out by a Gaussian envelope, leaving essentially only a central peak with rapidly decaying side lobes.

Candidate 1’s part (a) answer is  

I(θ) = 4 A² cos²(π a sin θ / λ).

Unless A² is declared equal to I₀, this does not fix the scale requested in the problem. More importantly, for part (b) Candidate 1 merely writes  

I(θ) ∼ ρ(a) cos²(π a sin θ / λ),

which does not state the averaged intensity pattern; it just multiplies the original cos² term by the probability density, leaving the result unspecified. Thus Candidate 1 does not provide the same content as Candidate 2 for part (b).

Because the two answers differ in both completeness and explicit form, they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same mathematical expressions for the magnitudes of the three angles, but Candidate 1 explicitly includes a “±” in each answer while Candidate 2 lists only the principal (positive) value.  
Because the two answer sets are therefore not exactly identical for every sub-problem (Rule 2), the responses are not considered equivalent.
The problem has three sub-questions, so each candidate must give three corresponding answers.  
Both candidates supply three formulas, but for every sub-question candidate 1 writes “± sin⁻¹( … )”, while candidate 2 writes just “sin⁻¹( … )” (or “arcsin( … )”). Thus:

• Candidate 1 explicitly gives two symmetric angles (positive and negative) for each case.  
• Candidate 2 gives only one angle (implicitly the principal positive value).

Because the sets of values supplied for each sub-question are not identical—candidate 1 includes an extra negative angle each time—the two predictions are not equivalent under Rule 2/Rule 3.

Both candidates give two wavelengths.

Candidate 1: 6000 Å and 4285 Å  
Candidate 2: 6000 Å and 4285.71 Å

• The first wavelength (6000 Å) is identical.  
• For the second wavelength, compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
  – Candidate 1: 4285 Å → 4285.00 (to six significant digits)  
  – Candidate 2: 4285.71 Å  

The digits differ already at the 5-th significant digit, so they do not match to 6 significant digits. Therefore the two answer sets are not equivalent.

Both candidates agree on part (a) and give essentially the same qualitative answer for part (c), but part (b) is handled differently:  

• Candidate 2 supplies the requested qualitative sketch/description of the magnetic-field lines.  
• Candidate 1 does not give any field-line pattern; instead an unrelated force formula is offered.  

Because the problem has three sub-parts and Candidate 1 fails to answer one of them, the two submissions are not equivalent under Rule 2.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question requests three separate items (a, b, c).  
Both candidates give answers for all three items, so we must compare each corresponding sub-answer (Rule 2).

(a) Positions of the two zeros  
• Candidate 1: x = ± (1/√3) d  
• Candidate 2: x = ± (√2 − 1) d  
These are clearly different numerical values, so the two candidates disagree on part (a).

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not identical (Rule 2).

Therefore the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The problem requires three numerical answers (L, M, q).  
Comparing each pair:

1. Self-inductance L  
   • Candidate 1: 2.513 × 10⁻⁴ H  
   • Candidate 2: 8π × 10⁻⁵ H = 2.51327 × 10⁻⁴ H  
   At 6 significant digits: 2.51300 × 10⁻⁴ vs 2.51327 × 10⁻⁴ → differ at the 5th digit.

2. Mutual inductance M  
   • Candidate 1: 2.513 × 10⁻⁵ H  
   • Candidate 2: 8π × 10⁻⁶ H = 2.51327 × 10⁻⁵ H  
   Same numerical mismatch as above.

3. Charge q  
   • Candidate 1: 2.76 × 10⁻⁷ C  
   • Candidate 2: 8π × 10⁻⁹ C = 2.51327 × 10⁻⁸ C  
   Values differ by an order of magnitude.

Because at least one sub-answer differs between the candidates, the overall answer sets are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 4).

The two candidate answers are not equivalent.

• For the indices of refraction (part (a)) the expressions differ in appearance but become identical once ε₀ = 1/(μ₀c²) is used, so those match.

• For the rotation angle (part (b)) candidate 1 gives  φ₁ = ½ γ μ₀ ω² L, whereas candidate 2 gives  φ₂ = γ ω L / c.  After substituting c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀), these two formulas are clearly not the same (φ₁ contains an extra factor of ω and a different dependence on μ₀/ε₀).  Therefore the answers disagree.

Because at least one of the required sub-answers differs, the overall predictions are not equivalent.
The question asks for two separate results (indices of refraction and rotation angle).  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different formulas for both:

1. Indices of refraction  
   • Candidate 1: n ≈ 1 ± (γ μ₀ ω c)/2  
   • Candidate 2: n ≈ 1 ± (γ ω)/(2 c)  
   These differ by factors of μ₀ and c; they are not the same expression.

2. Rotation angle  
   • Candidate 1: φ ≈ (½) γ μ₀ ω² L  
   • Candidate 2: φ ≈ (γ ω L)/c  
   Again the formulas are different (different powers of ω, presence of μ₀ vs. 1/c).

Because both required answers disagree, the candidates are not equivalent.

Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4) these values are clearly different. Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The problem asks for four separate answers (parts a–d).  
Comparing the two candidates term-by-term:

Part (a)  
• Candidate 1:  F = − e ρ₀ r /(2 ε₀) (radial unit vector)  
• Candidate 2:  F =  + e ρ₀ r /(2 ε₀)  

The expressions differ by a sign, so they are not identical.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the entire sets of answers are not equivalent according to Rule 2 (all sub-answers must match).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  

j = − (4 ε₀ V₀)/(9 d²) · √(2 e V₀/m) eₓ  
          = − (4 ε₀)/(9 d²) · (2 e/m)^{1/2} · V₀^{3/2} eₓ.

Candidate 2 gives  

J = (4 ε₀)/(9 d²) · (2 e V₀/m)^{3/2}  
          = (4 ε₀)/(9 d²) · (2 e/m)^{3/2} · V₀^{3/2}.

Comparing the magnitudes:

• Candidate 1 ∝ (2 e/m)^{1/2} V₀^{3/2}.  
• Candidate 2 ∝ (2 e/m)^{3/2} V₀^{3/2} = (2 e/m)·(2 e/m)^{1/2} V₀^{3/2}.

Thus Candidate 2 is larger by a factor (2 e/m) and has the opposite sign (and no direction vector).

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 explicitly gives values for all six required field components:
Eₓ, Bₓ, E_y, B_y, E_z, B_z.

Candidate 2 lists Eₓ, E_y, E_z, B_y, B_z, but never states the value of Bₓ.  
Thus Candidate 2 omits one of the quantities the problem asks for.

By Rule 2, if any required component is missing, the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different results for BOTH requested quantities:

1. Electrostatic energy:  
   • Candidate 1 has \( \dfrac{2\rho^{2}R_{1}^{5}}{45\varepsilon_{0}} \).  
   • Candidate 2 has \( \dfrac{2\pi\rho^{2}R_{1}^{5}}{45\varepsilon_{0}} \) (extra factor of π).

2. Potential at the center:  
   • Candidate 1 gives \( +\dfrac{\rho R_{1}^{2}}{6\varepsilon_{0}} \).  
   • Candidate 2 gives \( -\dfrac{\rho R_{1}^{2}}{6\varepsilon_{0}} \) (opposite sign).

Both candidates supply two formulas, but the corresponding formulas are not algebraically identical:

For +q case:  
Candidate 1: Q ≥ [a²(3r – a)] q / [r (r – a)²]  
Candidate 2: Q ≥ q a² / (r – a)²  

Their ratio is (3r – a)/r = 3 – a/r, which is not identically 1.

For –q case:  
Candidate 1: Q ≥ q a²(3r + a) / [r (r + a)²]  
Candidate 2: Q ≥ q a² / (r + a)²  

Their ratio is (3r + a)/r = 3 + a/r, also not 1.

Hence the two candidates’ answers are different.

The question requires answers for four separate parts.  
Comparing the two candidates for each part:

(a) Potential distribution  
• Candidate 1: single closed-form expression involving an arctan.  
• Candidate 2: two different Fourier-series expressions inside/outside the cylinder.  
These are clearly not the same form; there is no evident equivalence.

(b) Field for r ≫ a  
• Candidate 1: components ∝ 1/r².  
• Candidate 2: components ∝ 1/r³.  
Different radial dependence ⇒ not equivalent.

(c) Field for r ≪ a  
• Candidate 1: E_r = −(2V₀/πa) sinθ, E_θ = −(2V₀/πa) cosθ.  
• Candidate 2: uniform field −(2V₀/πa) x̂ (which in polar coordinates is E_r = −E₀ cosθ, E_θ = +E₀ sinθ with E₀ = 2V₀/πa).  
These component patterns differ (signs and sin/cos swapped) ⇒ not equivalent.

(d) Field-line sketch  
Candidate 1 supplies none; Candidate 2 gives a qualitative description. Requirement mismatch.

Because at least one sub-answer differs for every relevant part, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply formulas for parts (a)–(c).  
Comparing part (a):

• Candidate 1:  (e² / 16 π² ε₀ c) |ẋβ|² sin²θ  
   → since |ẋβ| = a / c, this equals (e² a²)/(16 π² ε₀ c³) sin²θ

• Candidate 2:  (e² a²)/(8 π ε₀ c³) sin²θ

The numerical coefficients differ (1/(16 π²) vs 1/(8 π)); hence the two answers for part (a) are not the same.

Reasoning:

1. The question asks for two vector fields (inside and outside the sphere).  
   • Candidate 1 supplies both as full vector expressions:  
     – Inside: 𝐄₁ = (3 ε₀)/(ε + 2 ε₀) 𝐄₀  
     – Outside: 𝐄₂ = 𝐄₀ + (ε − ε₀)/(ε + 2 ε₀) R³[ 3(𝐄₀·𝐫)𝐫/r⁵ − 𝐄₀/r³ ]

   • Candidate 2 gives  
     – Inside: 𝐄_in = 3/(ε + 2) 𝐄₀ (units/definitions differ from C1)  
     – Outside: 𝐄_out = 𝐄₀(1 − 3(ε − 1)R³ cosθ/((ε + 2)r³)) (only a single scalar factor with cos θ; lacks the full vector components, no θ-component, no explicit unit consistency).

2. Outside-field expressions are not the same: Candidate 1 contains both radial (r̂) and ẑ contributions, whereas Candidate 2 only modifies the z-component (no θ-component). Hence the fields differ.

3. Even for the inside field, Candidate 2 uses ε as a dimensionless relative permittivity (κ), while Candidate 1 uses the absolute permittivity ε; without an explicit statement these are not guaranteed equivalent.

Because at least one sub-answer (the outside field) is different, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 8).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem asks for TWO vector fields:  
1. the field inside the sphere,  
2. the field outside the sphere.

Hence both parts must be compared.

Inside the sphere  
• Candidate 1:   E_in =  (3 ε₀)/(ε + 2 ε₀)  E₀ ẑ  
• Candidate 2:   E_in =  3/(ε + 2)  E₀ ẑ

Candidate 1 uses the absolute permittivity ε, so ε₀ is explicitly present.  
Candidate 2 treats ε as a dimensionless dielectric constant and contains no ε₀.  
Unless one re-interprets the symbols, these two formulas are not the same expression.

Outside the sphere  
• Candidate 1:  E_out = E₀ + [(ε − ε₀)/(ε + 2 ε₀)] R³ [3(E₀·r)r/r⁵ − E₀/r³]  
  → Components: E_r = E₀ cosθ [1 + 2α/r³],   E_θ = −E₀ sinθ [1 − α/r³]  
  with α = (ε − ε₀)/(ε + 2 ε₀) R³.

• Candidate 2:  E_r = E₀ cosθ [1 − 3β/r³],   E_θ = −E₀ sinθ [1 − β/r³]  
  with β = (ε − 1)/(ε + 2) R³.

Even ignoring the ε vs ε₀ issue, the radial factor differs (1 + 2α vs 1 − 3β), so the vector fields are different.

Since both the inside and outside expressions disagree, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem requires two vector fields:  
1) the uniform interior field,  
2) the full exterior field of the polarized sphere (a dipole‐like field with angular dependence).

Candidate 1 supplies both:

• Inside: 𝐄₁ = (3 ε₀)/(ε + 2 ε₀) 𝐄₀.  
• Outside: 𝐄₂ = 𝐄₀ + (ε − ε₀)/(ε + 2 ε₀) R³[3(𝐄₀·𝐫)𝐫/r⁵ − 𝐄₀/r³]  (full dipole form, angular dependence).

Candidate 2 gives:

• Inside: 𝐄 = 3/(ε + 2) 𝐄₀ (ε₀ absent).  
• Outside: 𝐄 = 𝐄₀[1 − (ε − 1)/(ε + 2)(R/r)³] ẑ  (only the z-component; angular part missing).

Differences:

1. Units/parameters: Candidate 1 uses absolute permittivities ε, ε₀; Candidate 2 uses relative ε without ε₀, so the coefficients differ unless ε is interpreted differently.  
2. Exterior field: Candidate 2 omits the angular dependence present in the correct dipole field; it gives only the field along the z-axis, not the full vector expression.

Because both numerical factors and functional form differ, the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 gives the specific value  hν′ = mc²/2.

These are not identically the same; the second is only the high-energy limit of the first. Because the required answer must be the same for both candidates in every sub-problem and they are not identical here, the two responses are not equivalent.

2. Energy while spinning:

   • Candidate 2 says it is infinite.

The question asks for TWO quantities:  
(a) an angle,  
(b) a speed.

Speed: both candidates give √79/10 c – identical.

Angle:  
• Candidate 1: arctan(8/√15).  
• Candidate 2: arctan(√15/8).

These two arctangent arguments are reciprocals; arctan(x) ≠ arctan(1/x) (they add to 90° for positive x). Therefore the numerical angles differ (~64.5° vs ~25.8°).

Since at least one of the required sub-answers differs, the full answer sets are not identical (Rule 2 and Rule 4). Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The only differences are notation for the sphere’s radius (R vs a) and the presence/absence of a boldface arrow indicating the vector character of the dipole moment. These are purely notational; the expressions are the same mathematically.

Therefore the two sets of answers are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give two expressions (inside and outside fields), so Rule 2 applies: every corresponding sub-answer must agree.

• Inside the sphere: both give the same factor 3 ε₂ / (ε₁ + 2 ε₂); these are equivalent.

• Outside the sphere:  
 – Candidate 1: E + (ε₁ − ε₂)/(ε₁ + 2 ε₂) a³ [3(E·r)r/r⁵ − E/r³] – contains the uniform field term plus a dipole term ∝ a³/r³.  
 – Candidate 2: (3 ε₁/(2 ε₂ + ε₁)) E cosθ r̂ − (3 ε₂/(2 ε₂ + ε₁)) E sinθ θ̂ – no 1/r³ dependence and no separate uniform term. As r→∞ this does not reduce to the original uniform field E, so it is not the same expression.

The problem asks for two vector-field answers:  
1) the field inside the sphere (r < a)  
2) the field outside the sphere (r > a)

Inside: Both candidates give  
E_inside = 3 ε₂ / (ε₁ + 2 ε₂)  E,  
so they match on the interior result.

Outside:  

Candidate 1:  
E + (ε₁ – ε₂)/(ε₁ + 2 ε₂)  a³ [3(E·r) r / r⁵ – E / r³]

Candidate 2:  
E + 3 ε₂(ε₁ – ε₂) a³ /[(ε₁ + 2 ε₂) r³] · (3 cosθ r̂ – ẑ)/(4π ε₂)

Comparing:

• Candidate 2 contains an extra factor 3/(4π) and lacks the overall magnitude E.  
• Its coefficient therefore differs from Candidate 1 by E × 4π/3, so the two expressions are not the same.  
• Thus the outside fields are inequivalent, meaning the complete answers are not equivalent.

Hence the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for three separate results.  
• For parts (a) and (b) both candidates give the same formulas.  
• For part (c) Candidate 1 gives ΔQ = Q ln(r/r₁)/ln(r₂/r₁) whereas Candidate 2 gives ΔQ = Q.

These expressions are not the same for a general r (r₁ < r < r₂). Therefore the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ in the denominator:  

• Candidate 1 has 2 π R + (μ_r − 1) s  
• Candidate 2 has 2 π R + μ_r s  

Since those denominators are not algebraically identical, the predicted magnetic fields are different. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not the same.  
After simplifying candidate 2 one gets  

B₂ = (μ_r μ₀ N I)/(2πR + μ_r s),  

whereas candidate 1 is  

B₁ = (μ_r μ₀ N I)/(2πR + (μ_r – 1) s).  

Because the denominators differ (μ_r s vs. (μ_r – 1) s), the results are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

• Candidate 2:  R =  (1 − √ε)/(1 + √ε)

Since the second answer is not squared, the two results are generally unequal except in special, non-generic cases. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply three answers corresponding to parts (a), (b) and (c), and the formulas coincide:

(a) 0 vs 0  
(b) μ₀I(r²–a²)/(2πr(b²–a²)) vs the same expression  
(c) μ₀I/(2πr) vs the same expression

The only difference is that Candidate 1 explicitly includes the azimuthal unit vector 𝐞_θ, while Candidate 2 states only the magnitude. Since the underlying functional dependence is identical and the direction is implicit in Candidate 2 (and not contradicted), the two sets of answers are regarded as equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Reasoning:

The problem asks for the magnetic field B (a vector quantity) in three radial regions.  
• Candidate 1 supplies the full vector expression, explicitly giving the azimuthal unit vector 𝐞_θ in parts (b) and (c).  
• Candidate 2 supplies only the scalar magnitude in each region; no direction is stated.

While the magnitudes given by the two candidates match, Candidate 2 omits the directional information that is part of the required answer for a vector field. According to Rule 2 (omitting a required component) and Rule 6 (type mismatch / incomplete answer), the two responses are not equivalent.

The problem has two sub-questions, so both parts of each candidate’s answer must match for the answers to be equivalent (Rule 2).

Part (a) – Electric field  
• Candidate 1: ρ / (3 ε₀) · 𝒂   (a vector expression)  
• Candidate 2: ρ a / (3 ε₀)   (a scalar magnitude; no vector arrow or direction specified)

These are not the same: Candidate 1 gives a vector, while Candidate 2 gives only a scalar. Therefore the two answers differ for part (a).

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually supply the electric-field expressions requested in part (a); it only points to an external “Problem 1013.”  
Candidate 2 explicitly gives both the external and internal electric-field vectors as well as the potentials.  
Because the question requires answers for both parts (a) and (b) and Candidate 1 fails to supply the part (a) result, the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single formula for the spiral-in time τ.

1. Candidate 1: τ₁ = (7 π² ε₀² c³ m² R³)/(2 q⁴)

2. Candidate 2: τ₂ = (7 π ε₀ c³ m² R³)/(8 k q⁴)

Taking k = 1/(4 π ε₀) (the usual Coulomb constant),

 τ₂ = (7 π ε₀ c³ m² R³)/(8·[1/(4 π ε₀)] q⁴)
   = (7 π ε₀ c³ m² R³)(4 π ε₀)/(8 q⁴)
   = (7·4 π² ε₀² c³ m² R³)/(8 q⁴)
   = (7 π² ε₀² c³ m² R³)/(2 q⁴)

which is exactly τ₁.

Therefore the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical / symbolic value (the work required).  

Candidate 1 gives a non-zero expression
  W₁ = q² / (8 π ε₀) (1/R – 1/(R+t))

Candidate 2 states the answer is
  W₂ = 0

These two results are clearly different for general positive R, t, q, so they cannot be equivalent (Rule 4).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not mathematically the same:

Candidate 1 = (q² / 8 π ε₀)·(1/R – 1/(R+t))  
        = (q² t) / [8 π ε₀ R (R+t)]

Candidate 2 = (q²) / [4 π ε₀ (R+t)]

Their ratio is (t / 2R). Since t is an independent parameter (in general t ≠ 2R), the two results differ in magnitude except for the special case t = 2R. Hence, they are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ by an overall factor of 2:

Candidate 1: W₁ = –(K – 1) / [16 π ε₀ x (K + 1)]
Candidate 2: W₂ = –(K – 1) / [ 8 π ε₀ x (K + 1)] = 2 W₁

Since they are not equal, the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ by a factor of 2 in the denominator:

Candidate 1: W₁ = −(K−1) q² / [16 π ε₀ x (1+K)]

Candidate 2: W₂ = −(K−1) q² / [ 8 π ε₀ x (1+K)]

Thus W₂ = 2 W₁, so they are not equal.

 F₁ = – q² / (4 ε₁ a²).

Candidate 2 gives a force magnitude (and direction)  
 F₂ = + q² / (16 π ε₁ a²) upward.

Comparing:

1. Numerical factors differ: 1/4 vs 1/(16 π). Even ignoring the sign, 1/4 ≠ 1/(16 π) (they differ by a factor 4π ≈ 12.6).
2. Sign/direction differ: Candidate 1 is negative (implicitly downward); Candidate 2 is positive and explicitly “upward”.
3. Both use the same dielectric constant symbol ε₁, so units are comparable; the values are clearly different.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions: 

Candidate 1: t = m² c³ a₀³ / (4 e⁴)

Candidate 2: t = 4 π² ε₀² m² c³ a₀³ / e⁴

Candidate 2 contains the factors 4 π² ε₀² that are completely absent (or appear with different powers after any unit-system conversion) in Candidate 1. Even if one tries to reinterpret Candidate 1 in Gaussian units and convert to SI, the resulting numerical factor becomes 64 π⁴ ε₀⁴ / e⁴, which still does not match Candidate 2’s 4 π² ε₀² / e⁴. Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ by a factor of 16 π² ε₀².  
Unless one candidate is intentionally using a different system of electromagnetic units (which the problem statement does not specify), that extra factor means the numerical predictions are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give exactly the same expressions for the electric-field regions and for the induced inner-surface charge:

1. Region r < a :  E = q/(4π ε₀ r²)  (radial)  
2. Region a < r < b :  E = 0  
3. Region r > b :  E = σ b²/(ε₀ r²)  (radial)  
4. Inner-surface charge: −q  

Since every requested sub-answer matches, the two predictions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give:

1. Charge on the inner surface: −q  
2. Electric‐field regions  
   • r < a :  E = q /(4π ε₀ r²) r̂  
   • a < r < b :  E = 0  
   • r > b :  E = σ b² /(ε₀ r²) r̂  

Although candidate 1 does not explicitly label the regions, its three field expressions can only correspond uniquely to the three regions stated explicitly by candidate 2, and the formulas match exactly (including the absence of 4π in the outer region expression for both). Therefore every required sub-answer is the same in the two predictions.

Candidate 1: F = (e² n r)/(2 π ε₀ γ²) e_r  
Using γ = 1/√(1-v²/c²) ⇒ 1/γ² = 1-v²/c², so  
|F| = (e² n r)/(2 π ε₀) (1-v²/c²).

Candidate 2: (e² n r)/(2 ε₀) (1-v²/c²).

The two magnitudes differ by a factor of π (Candidate 1 has 1/π). Therefore the two answers are not the same (and Candidate 2 also omits the explicit radial unit vector).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same γ-dependence, since  

1/γ² = 1 − v²/c².

However, the overall coefficient differs:

• Candidate 1: (e² n r)/(2 π ε₀) · (1/γ²)  
• Candidate 2: (e² n r)/(2 ε₀) · (1/γ²)

The first expression has an extra factor 1/π compared with the second. Therefore the two results are not the same.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give expressions for all four requested quantities.  
• For the electric-field (a) and magnetic-field (b) they coincide after identifying λ = q⁄l and using μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²).  
• For the energy density (c) they also coincide because (1/ε₀ + μ₀v²) = (1+v²/c²)/ε₀.  

However, for the momentum density (d):

Inside r<R  
– Candidate 1: g = v² q² r² /(4π² ε₀ c² R⁴ l²) ẑ (proportional to v²)  
– Candidate 2: g = μ₀ λ² v r² /(4π² R⁴) ẑ = v q² r² /(4π² ε₀ c² R⁴ l²) ẑ (proportional to v)

Outside r>R  
– Candidate 1 again carries an extra factor of v compared with Candidate 2.

Thus the two answers disagree on the factor of v in the momentum density. Since at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.
The question asks for four separate fields/quantities (E, B, energy density, momentum density).  
Both candidates supply all four, but:

• For the energy density, Candidate 1 has a factor 1/ε₀ in the denominator, whereas Candidate 2 has 1/ε₀² (they differ by a factor ε₀).  
• For the momentum density, Candidate 1 contains a factor v²/c² while Candidate 2 contains only v (they differ by a factor v / c²).

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same expressions for  

(a) the electric field 𝑬 and  
(b) the magnetic field 𝑩,  

and Candidate 2’s generic formula for the energy density (c) reduces to the explicit form given by Candidate 1, so parts (a)–(c) are compatible.

However, for (d) the momentum-density vector:

• Candidate 1:   g ∝ v² …  (+ z direction)  
• Candidate 2:   g ∝ v …  (− z direction)

The magnitudes differ (v² vs v) and the directions have opposite signs.  
Since at least one sub-answer disagrees, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question has two sub-problems:

(a) give the nature and amount of the discontinuity,  
(b) give BOTH σ and τ.

Candidate 1 supplies three pieces of information:  
• Δφ = τ/ε₀ (part a)  
• σ = −q/(4πa²) (part b)  
• τ = −q/(4πa) e_r (part b)

Candidate 2 gives only two pieces:  
• τ = −q/(4πa)  
• σ = −q/(4πa²)

Candidate 2 omits any answer at all for part (a).  Because the problem requires an answer for each sub-problem, the two candidate responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).
The question has two sub-parts and thus requires:

(a) statement of which quantity is discontinuous and the size of the discontinuity;  
(b) values for both σ and τ.

Comparison:

Part (a)  
• Candidate 1: says the potential itself is discontinuous, Δφ = τ/ε₀.  
• Candidate 2: says the derivative of the potential (the electric field) is discontinuous, with jump τ/ε₀.

They name different quantities as discontinuous, therefore their answers for (a) are different.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two overall responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).


Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same answer for part (a) (Δφ = τ/ε₀), but for part (b) their values of the dipole-layer moment density differ in sign:

• Candidate 1: τ = − q /(4π a) e_r  
• Candidate 2: τ = + q /(4π a)  (no vector given, implicit outward direction)

Since at least one sub-answer is different, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for three separate results.  
Compare each sub-answer:

1. Force on +q  
   • Candidate 1:  F = (√2 – 1) q² / (32 π ε₀ a²)  (scalar, positive)  
   • Candidate 2:  **vector** 𝐅 = [ (–4+√2)/(16 a²) ] k q² (î + k̂)  (negative coefficient, direction given)  
   The magnitudes, signs, and even the form (scalar vs vector) differ → not equivalent.

2. Work/energy  
   • Candidate 1:  W = (√2 – 1) q² / (16 π ε₀ a) = k q²/a · (√2 – 1)/4 (positive)  
   • Candidate 2:  U = (1–√2)/(2√2 a) k q² (negative)  
   Coefficients have opposite signs → not equivalent.

3. Surface charge density  
   Both give σ = q/(2π ε₀ a²) (1/(5√5) – 1) → equivalent.

Because answers (a) and (b) disagree, the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 1: C′ = (ε + ε₀)/(2 ε₀) · C  → if ε = ε_r ε₀ this simplifies to ((1 + ε_r)/2) C  
Candidate 2: C′ = (2 ε)/(1 + ε) · C  → with ε interpreted as ε_r this is (2 ε_r)/(1 + ε_r) C

(1 + ε_r)/2 ≠ 2 ε_r/(1 + ε_r) for general ε_r (they coincide only when ε_r = 1).  
Hence, the two answers are not equivalent.
The two expressions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: C′ = (ε + ε₀)/(2 ε₀) · C = (½)(ε/ε₀ + 1) C  
Candidate 2: C′ = 2 ε / (1 + ε) · C

If ε is taken as the absolute permittivity, candidate 2’s ratio 2 ε / (1 + ε) is not dimensionless, so it cannot be compared to candidate 1’s dimensionless factor.  
If ε is instead interpreted as the relative permittivity κ = ε/ε₀, then:

Candidate 1 gives (κ + 1)/2 · C,  
Candidate 2 gives 2 κ / (κ + 1) · C.

These two factors are equal only when κ = 1; in general they differ. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ by factors of R in every term except for the overall factor φ₀.  
Candidate 1 contains R, R² and R⁴ in the 1/r, 1/r² and 1/r⁴ terms, respectively, while Candidate 2 omits these factors (equivalent only to the special, non-physical case R = 1). Therefore the two answers are not mathematically equivalent for a general radius R.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 includes the factor (R/r)n in every term, giving the correct dimensionless ratio expected from the problem statement.  
Candidate 2 lacks every factor of R: its terms are φ0/(2 r), 3φ0 cosθ/(4 r²), etc.  These expressions have different physical dimensions unless one implicitly sets R = 1, which the answer does not state.  

Because of this missing R dependence, the two potentials are not the same expression.

2. the electric-field expression E(r).

• Both candidates give the same functional dependence for K(r) (constant / r²).  
• For E(r) they differ only by an overall minus sign:  
  – Candidate 1:  E(r) = – 2 V r / (b² – a²)  
  – Candidate 2:  E(r) =  + 2 V r / (b² – a²)

• Outside the wire (s > a)  
  – Candidate 1: B = μ₀ I / (2π s)  
  – Candidate 2: B = μ₀(1+χ_m) I / (2π s)

The question asks for fields, induced field, torque, and total angular momentum (three sub-parts with several required quantities).

Comparison:

1. Electric field (part a): both candidates give the same expression.

2. Magnetic field (part a): both give B = (2/3)μ₀M inside and the same dipole form outside. OK.

3. Induced electric field (part b):
   • Candidate 1: E_ind = −(μ₀ ẊM r sinθ)/3  φ̂ (inside) and −(μ₀ ẊM r sinθ/3)(R/r)³ φ̂ (outside).
   • Candidate 2: E_ind = −(μ₀ r ẊM)/3  φ̂ (inside) only, i.e. lacks the sinθ factor and gives no outside field.
   These are not the same.

4. Torque (part b):
   • Candidate 1: gives no explicit torque.
   • Candidate 2: gives a torque τ = (π μ₀ M₀ Q R²)/6.
   Missing quantity in Candidate 1 → answers not equivalent.

5. Total angular momentum (part b):
   • Candidate 1: L = (2/9) μ₀ M Q R²  ẑ.
   • Candidate 2: L = (π μ₀ M₀ Q R²)/6.
   Values differ.

Because they disagree (or one omits) on required quantities in part (b), the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for answers to two sub-questions:

(a) State whether a quadrupole acts as a lens and whether the focusing is the same in x and y.
(b) Give the numerical focal length f for 20 GeV electrons.

Comparison:

Sub-answer (a)  
• Candidate 1: Says the quadrupole acts as a lens and gives f_y = –f_x, i.e. focusing differs between x and y.  
• Candidate 2: Says it acts as a lens and focusing is not the same in x and y.  
→ Both candidates give the same qualitative statement, so (a) matches.

Sub-answer (b)  
• Candidate 1: f ≈ 6.67 m  
• Candidate 2: 6.666 m  

Expressed to six significant digits these are 6.67000 and 6.66600, which differ in the third decimal place; therefore they do NOT match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates’ overall answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 supplies two explicit answers:
1) a formula for the focal lengths in x and y (f_y = –f_x = p₀R/(qLB₀)), addressing part (a);
2) a numerical focal length f ≈ 6.67 m for part (b).

Candidate 2 supplies only a single numerical value, 666.0 m.

Thus:
• Candidate 2 omits any answer to part (a) → requirements differ (Rule 2).  
• Even for part (b), 6.67 m ≠ 666.0 m (different by a factor 100, Rule 4).

Therefore the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give different focal lengths for the mirror in part (a) (+21 m vs –21 m).  
Part (b) also differs: candidate 2 states the incident directions for all three stages, whereas candidate 1 does not.

The problem asks for three pieces of information:  
1. The force between the two dipoles.  
2. The torque when one dipole is mis-aligned by an angle θ.  
3. The equilibrium orientation if the mis-aligned dipole is free to rotate.

Candidate 1 supplies only two formulas (force and torque) and omits the equilibrium-orientation answer entirely, already violating Rule 2.  
Even for the two formulas it does give, the expressions are incomplete: the force lacks the r⁻⁴ dependence and the torque lacks the r⁻³ dependence (and both omit required numerical factors).

Candidate 2 gives three explicit answers (force, torque, and the statement of equilibrium orientation) with full r-dependence and numerical factors.

Because Candidate 1 both omits one required answer and its provided formulas differ from Candidate 2’s in form and factors, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different expressions for every requested quantity.

1. Force:  
   • Candidate 1: 𝐅 = −3 μ₀ m₁ m₂ ẑ (no r–dependence, wrong units)  
   • Candidate 2: F = 3 μ₀ m₁ m₂ /(2π r⁴) along the line (includes r⁴ in denominator)

2. Torque:  
   • Candidate 1: 𝐍 = −μ₀ m₁ m₂ sinθ ŷ (no r–dependence)  
   • Candidate 2: τ = μ₀ m₁ m₂ sinθ /(2π r³)

3. Equilibrium orientation:  
   • Candidate 1 gives none.  
   • Candidate 2 states “aligned parallel”.

According to Rule 2, all sub-answers must match; they clearly do not. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reasoning:

1. Part (a) – Electric field pattern  
   • Candidate 1 gives a field with Ex, Ey (and Ez) components involving cos(nxπx/a) sin(nyπy/b).  
   • Candidate 2 gives a purely Ey field proportional to sin(mπx/a) sin(nπy/b).  

   These are different mode structures (cos vs sin pattern; multiple components vs single component). They are not merely phase‐shifted versions of the same function and correspond to different modal types (Candidate 1 mixes components; Candidate 2 gives a single TE component). Hence the fields are not the same.

2. Part (a) – Dispersion relation  
   Candidate 1 writes ω² = [k_z² + (mπ/a)² + (nπ/b)²] c², while Candidate 2 omits the explicit c, giving k_z² = ω² − [(mπ/a)² + (nπ/b)²]. Unless one sets c = 1, these differ, and the question statement does not explicitly adopt c = 1.

3. Part (c) – Cut-off frequency  
   Candidate 1 states only the lowest-mode cut-off ω_10 = πc/a, whereas Candidate 2 gives the general cut-off ω_c = √[(mπ/a)² + (nπ/b)²]. The answers are therefore not identical.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same numerical value (280 MeV) for the threshold kinetic energy and include the same unit, satisfying the required comparison to six significant digits. Therefore, they are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

The problem asks for one numerical value (threshold kinetic energy).  
Both candidates give a value in the same unit (MeV).  
Rule 4 requires comparing to 6 significant digits; 280 MeV (interpreted as 2.80000 × 10²) and 279.7 MeV (2.79700 × 10²) differ within those six digits. Hence the answers are not identical.

Both sub-questions must match.

Sub-answer (b): both candidates give I = 2 → they match.

Sub-answer (a):  
• Candidate 1: Δm (or Γ) = ħ(γ₁+γ₂).  
• Candidate 2: Δm = (γ₁+γ₂)/c².

These expressions differ (one contains ħ, the other 1/c², so units and numerical factors are not the same). Therefore sub-answer (a) disagrees, making the overall answers inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Reasoning:

The question has two separate sub-parts.

(a) It asks specifically for the “uncertainty in the mass.”  
• Candidate 1 gives Γ ≈ ħ(γ₁+γ₂). This is an energy width (or a total decay width), not explicitly a mass uncertainty, and it lacks the factor 1/c² that would convert energy width to mass width in ordinary units.  
• Candidate 2 gives Δm = ħ(γ₁+γ₂)/c², explicitly a mass uncertainty.

Because these two expressions differ by the factor 1/c² and represent different physical quantities, the answers to part (a) are not the same.

(b) Both candidates state the isotopic spin is 2, so they match for this sub-part.

However, Rule 2 says that for multi-part questions, all sub-answers must match for the candidates to be considered equivalent. Since they do not match in part (a), the overall answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for 10 separate ratios (sub-parts a–j).  
Candidate 1 supplies one numerical estimate for each ratio.  
Candidate 2 supplies symbolic expressions (many different from those numbers).  

Already at sub-part (a):

• Candidate 1: 1.5 × 10⁻³  
• Candidate 2: 1 / θ_c²  

These are clearly not the same value or form. Since at least one required sub-answer differs, by Rule 2 the two full sets of answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for four sub-answers (with lifetime and mean distance both required in part (a)).  
Comparing each sub-answer:

Part (a):  
• Lifetime: 2.78 × 10⁻²³ s (C1) vs 4.27 × 10⁻²⁴ s (C2) – different.  
• Mean distance: 8.23 × 10⁻¹³ cm (C1) vs 8.23 × 10⁻¹³ cm (C2 after converting from m) – same.

Part (b): Threshold energy: 1077 MeV (C1) vs 937 MeV (C2) – different.

Part (c): Number produced: 1.3 × 10⁻³ (C1) vs 1.26 × 10⁻³ (C2). At six significant digits these are 1.30000e-3 vs 1.26000e-3 – different.

Part (d): Opening angle: 0 (C1) vs 0 radians (C2) – same.

The question has several sub-parts:  
1. Briefly describe how a breeder reactor works.  
2. State the required physical constant (neutron production factor, η, which must be >2).  
3. State the constraint on reactor materials and answer whether water can be used as a moderator.

Candidate 2 supplies all three items: operation description, η > 2 (average neutrons per fission), material constraint, and “water cannot be used.”

Candidate 1 gives only two short bullets: “η > 2” and “No, water cannot be used.” It omits any explanation of how a breeder works and does not explicitly state the general materials constraint.

Because Candidate 1 is missing at least one required answer, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts, so each candidate must supply three matching answers.

Sub-answers:

(a)  
• Candidate 1: single value “≈ 1 MeV”.  
• Candidate 2: qualitative range “hundreds of keV to a few MeV”.

These are not identical.  Candidate 1 gives one specific (order-of-magnitude) value, whereas Candidate 2 gives only a broad range; Rule 2 says that when all sub-answers are given, each corresponding answer must be exactly the same, otherwise the candidates are not equivalent.

(b) Both give τ ∝ Z⁻⁴ → identical.  
(c) Both give the same configuration and term symbol.

Because sub-answer (a) differs, the overall sets of answers are not identical.

The question has three separate sub-parts, so each candidate must match on all three answers to be equivalent.

Sub-part (a):
• Candidate 1: a single value, “≈ 1 MeV”.
• Candidate 2: a range, “hundreds of keV to a few MeV”.

These are not exactly the same answer—one is a specific value, the other is a broader interval.

Because Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to be identical for equivalence, the difference in (a) makes the two candidates inequivalent (even though they agree on parts (b) and (c)).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has three independent sub-parts, so each individual answer must match.

Sub-answer (a)

Sub-answer (b)  
• Candidate 1: τ ∝ Z⁻⁴  
• Candidate 2: τ ∝ Z²  
— These are clearly different functional dependences.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Sub-problem (b):

The question has four sub-parts, so each candidate must give four matching answers.  

For sub-parts (a), (c) and (d) both candidates give essentially the same content.  

For sub-part (b) the numerical value differs:  
• Candidate 1: “about 210 MeV”  
• Candidate 2: “about 200 MeV”  

According to Rule 4, when comparing numerical answers we must match them to 6 significant digits; 210 MeV ≠ 200 MeV, so the two answers are different.  
Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has four sub-parts.  
For part (b) two separate pieces of information are required: an explanation of **why** energy is released and an estimate of **how much** energy is released per fission.

• Candidate 1 gives only the numerical estimate (“about 210 MeV”) and omits the required explanation.  
• Candidate 2 provides both the explanation (mass defect, E = mc²) and an estimate (“approximately 200 MeV”).

Thus the answers differ in completeness for sub-part (b).  
In addition, the two numerical values (200 MeV vs 210 MeV) do not match exactly (2.00000×10² vs 2.10000×10²), so they fail Rule 4 as well.

Because at least one sub-answer is different or missing, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.
The question has four separate sub-parts.  
Both candidates provide an answer for each sub-part, so we compare each corresponding item.

a) Both describe the same fission reaction mechanism (U-235, neutrons). → equivalent.  
b) Candidate 1: “about 210 MeV”; Candidate 2: “about 200 MeV”.  
   By Rule 4, numerical answers must match to 6 significant digits; 210 ≠ 200, so they differ.  
c) Both state that the fragments are neutron-rich and therefore radioactive. → equivalent.  
d) Both state that a moderator is needed to slow neutrons and that light elements are preferred. → equivalent.

Because sub-answer (b) is not the same, the overall sets of answers are not identical.  
Under Rule 2, any discrepancy in one required sub-answer makes the entire responses inequivalent.

The question asks for five distinct numerical results.

Comparison of each item supplied by the two candidates:

1. Rest mass  
   • C1: 0.14 GeV/​c² (= 140 MeV/​c²)  
   • C2: 140 MeV (energy units)  
   – Different physical units (mass vs energy). Not equivalent.

2. Kinetic energy (initial)  
   • C1: 0.68 GeV (= 680 MeV)  
   • C2: 670 MeV  
   – Values differ (680 MeV vs 670 MeV). Not identical to 6 significant digits.

3. Kinetic energy (after slowing)  
   • C1: 0.033 GeV (= 33 MeV)  
   • C2: 34 MeV  
   – Values differ (33 MeV vs 34 MeV).

4. Intrinsic half-life  
   • C1: 2.6 × 10⁻⁸ s  
   • C2: 1.8 × 10⁻⁸ s  
   – Different numbers.

5. Distance for 50 % decay of full-energy mesons

The question asks for two separate things:
1. The muon energy needed.
2. Whether Earth’s magnetic field is strong enough (implicitly requiring the field strength or at least a yes/no).

Comparison:

Sub-answer 1 (energy):
• Candidate 1: 6.7 × 10⁶ MeV  
• Candidate 2: 6.68 × 10⁶ MeV (but also contradictorily says “or 6.68 GeV”)  
Even ignoring the unit confusion in Candidate 2, 6.7 × 10⁶ vs 6.68 × 10⁶ do not match to 6 significant digits per Rule 4. Hence not identical.

Sub-answer 2 (magnetic field / sufficiency):
• Candidate 1: gives B = 3.49 × 10⁻³ T (≈ 35 Gs) and does not explicitly state if Earth’s field is sufficient.  
• Candidate 2: says the required B ≈ 52.5 µT and concludes Earth’s field is “approximately strong enough.”  
The numerical values differ by almost two orders of magnitude, and the conclusions differ (implicit “no” or unstated vs explicit “yes”).

Because both required answers disagree (and Candidate 1 even omits an explicit yes/no), the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives the required energy as 6.7 × 10⁶ MeV.  
Candidate 2 gives it as 6.68 × 10⁶ MeV (and inconsistently says “or 6.68 GeV”).

Expressed to six significant digits:  
Candidate 1: 6.70000 × 10⁶ MeV  
Candidate 2: 6.68000 × 10⁶ MeV  

The numbers differ beginning with the third significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not identical.  

For the magnetic-field part, Candidate 1 supplies 3.49 × 10⁻³ T (≈35 G), while Candidate 2 merely states qualitatively that Earth’s field is insufficient. The sub-answers therefore do not match either.

Since both required sub-answers disagree, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 2 × 10⁷.  
Candidate 2 gives 1 × 10⁷.

Expressed with the same exponent and six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 2.00000 × 10⁷  
Candidate 2 → 1.00000 × 10⁷

The numbers do not match to six significant digits; they differ by a factor of 2. Therefore, according to Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different numerical answers:

• Candidate 1: 2 × 10⁷  
• Candidate 2: 1 × 10⁷  

According to Rule 4, when comparing real numbers we must check if they match to 6 significant digits. 2×10⁷ and 1×10⁷ clearly do not match. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts.  
For parts (a) and (b) both candidates give exactly the same expressions/words.

For part (c):

• Candidate 1 gives ω = √(e² / (4π ε₀ a³ m))  
• Candidate 2 gives f = (1/2π) √(e² / (4π ε₀ a³ m))

Since ω = 2π f, the two results differ by a factor of 2π. Hence the sub-answers are not identical, so the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both expressions can be algebraically compared:

Candidate 2:
ν = (Δ c² (2M + Δ)) / (2 M h)
   = [Δ c² (2M) + Δ c² (Δ)] / (2 M h)
   = (2M Δ c²)/(2 M h) + (Δ² c²)/(2 M h)
   = (Δ c²)/h + (Δ c²)/h · (Δ/2M)
   = (Δ c²)/h · (1 + Δ/2M)

This is exactly Candidate 1:
ν = (Δ c²)/h · (1 + Δ/2M)

Hence the two candidates are mathematically identical (same units, same value).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give exactly the same formula:

(b)  
• Candidate 1: S, E  
• Candidate 2: S  

(d)  
• Candidate 1: S, E, W  
• Candidate 2: S, E  

Because the lists for at least one sub-problem differ, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two predictions use compatible units (GeV vs MeV), so convert them to the same unit:

• Candidate 1: 1.502 GeV = 1502 MeV  
• Candidate 2: 890.43 MeV

1502 MeV ≠ 890.43 MeV; they differ by hundreds of MeV and thus do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for two separate pieces of information:

1. (a) A formula relating σ₍II₎(W) to σ₍I₎(W).
2. (b) Both the threshold value W_thres and the near-threshold W-dependence of σ₍II₎(W).

Candidate 1 supplies the formula for (a) and the threshold for (b) but omits the near-threshold behaviour.

Candidate 2 supplies the threshold and the near-threshold behaviour for (b) but omits the formula for (a).

Since each candidate is missing at least one of the required answers, their responses are not equivalent.

Both candidates have the same algebraic fraction  
(m_K^2 − m_π^2 + (m_Λ − m_p)^2) / [2 (m_Λ − m_p)].

The only difference is that Candidate 2 multiplies the whole fraction by an explicit c², whereas Candidate 1 does not.

Because the question asks for an energy, an explicit factor of c² is needed to convert from combinations of masses to energy when masses are given in conventional units (kg or MeV/c²). The absence of this factor in Candidate 1 produces a quantity with the wrong dimensions unless one assumes natural units (c = 1), an assumption that is not stated in the problem text. According to Rule 1, such an omission that leaves the unit ambiguous makes the two answers inequivalent.

Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a field E ≳ 2 × 10⁹ Z³ V/cm (which equals 2 × 10¹¹ Z³ V/m after converting units).  
Candidate 2 gives a single value 1.16 × 10¹¹ V/m, with no Z-dependence.

Even for Z = 1, Candidate 1 predicts ≳ 2 × 10¹¹ V/m, which differs from 1.16 × 10¹¹ V/m by about 70 %. Moreover, Candidate 1’s result scales with Z³ while Candidate 2’s does not.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: E = 1 × 10¹⁰ V/m (no Z-dependence)

For Z = 1, Candidate 1 gives 2 × 10¹¹ V/m, twenty times larger than Candidate 2. They differ by more than 6 significant digits, and Candidate 1 also carries a Z³ dependence that Candidate 2 lacks. Therefore, according to Rules 1 and 4, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same value for part (a): β = 1/3.

For part (b):
• Candidate 1 writes “136 MeV/c²”.  
• Candidate 2 writes “136 MeV”.

“MeV/c²” is a unit of mass, while “MeV” is a unit of energy. Rest energy must be expressed in energy units (e.g., MeV). Because the units denote different physical quantities and cannot be treated as the same without an explicit c² factor, the two answers for part (b) are not equivalent.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the overall candidate responses are not equivalent.
The question requests two separate answers:  
(a) β = v/c  
(b) the meson rest energy.

Candidate 1 gives  
1. β = 1/3  
2. 136 MeV / c²

Candidate 2 gives  
1. β = 1/3  
2. 136 MeV

For part (a) the values are identical.

For part (b) the numerical value is the same (136).  The units differ but are related by the physical relation E = m c²: 136 MeV / c² corresponds to a mass whose rest-energy is 136 MeV.  Because this conversion is straightforward and leaves the numerical value unchanged, the two responses convey the same physical quantity.

Hence, considering Rule 1 (unit conversion with a physical relationship) and Rule 2 (all sub-answers match), the two candidates are equivalent.
The question asks for two quantities:
1. β = v/c
2. (approximate) rest energy of the mesons

Candidate 1:  
(a) 1/3  
(b) 136 MeV / c²

Candidate 2:  
(a) 1/3  
(b) 136 MeV

The first sub-answers match exactly (1/3).

For the second sub-answer, the numeric value is the same (136), but the units differ:
• Candidate 1 gives 136 MeV / c² (a mass).  
• Candidate 2 gives 136 MeV (an energy).

These represent different physical quantities; one cannot be directly equated to the other without multiplying or dividing by c². Because the required unit (rest energy) is MeV, the two answers are not the same according to Rule 1 (unit mismatch leading to ambiguity).

Hence the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The question has two sub-parts.  
For part (a) Candidate 1 gives a specific distribution  dN/dΩ = 1 − (1/3) cos θ, while Candidate 2 gives a generic form 1 + α cos θ without specifying the value or sign of α. These are not identical expressions; equality would require α = –1/3, which Candidate 2 does not state. Hence their answers to part (a) differ.  
For part (b) both say both decays violate parity, so they agree there.  
Because they disagree in part (a), the overall answers are not equivalent.

Reasoning: 
The question has four sub-parts, so four numerical answers must be compared.  
For each sub-answer the values must match to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

1. 329 vs. 329 → identical.  
2. 448 (→ 4.48000 ×10²) vs. 447.6 (→ 4.47600 ×10²) → differ at the 3rd significant digit.  
3. 0.955 (→ 0.955000) vs. 0.954 (→ 0.954000) → differ at the 4th significant digit.  
4. 1.32 ×10⁻¹³ vs. 1.32 ×10⁻¹³ → identical.

Because answers (b) and (c) are not identical to 6 significant digits, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.

• Part (b): both cite spin-orbit (orbital–spin) coupling → equivalent.  
• Part (a): the numerical prefactors differ.

 Candidate 1:   Eₙ = − me⁴ / [ 2 (4π ε₀)² ħ² n² ]  = − me⁴ / (32 π² ε₀² ħ² n²)  
 Candidate 2:   Eₙ = − me⁴ / (8 π² ε₀² ħ² n²)

The question requires two experiments with description and approximate date.  

Both candidates choose the same two experiments (Stern-Gerlach and Compton) and give similar descriptions, but they give different dates for the Stern-Gerlach experiment:  

• Candidate 1: 1921  
• Candidate 2: 1922  

Since Rule 2 states that when both candidates provide all requested answers, “each and every one of answers from both candidates must be exactly identical” and any discrepancy makes them inequivalent, the one-year difference constitutes a discrepancy. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts, so we must compare three corresponding answers.

Sub-part (a)  
• Candidate 1: diffusion coefficient D = ħ/(2m).  
• Candidate 2: diffusion coefficient D = ħ/(2m).  
These are identical.

Sub-part (b)  
• Candidate 1: “The boundary is felt after time elapses.”  
• Candidate 2: “Boundary not felt immediately; only after a time ≈ l²/(2D).”  
Both state that the boundary is not felt immediately but only after some time; the additional time scale given by Candidate 2 does not contradict Candidate 1, so this part is effectively the same qualitative answer.

Sub-part (c)  
• Candidate 1: ε_k ≤ ħ²/(2m l²).  
• Candidate 2: ε_k ≪ ħ²/(m l²).  
These bounds differ by a factor of 2, and Candidate 2’s “≪” expresses a much looser (order-of-magnitude) condition than Candidate 1’s explicit inequality. The two answers are therefore not identical.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ by the extra multiplicative factor  

(β + 1)^{1/(β + 1)}

present in Candidate 1 but absent in Candidate 2 (after accounting for h = 2πħ and separating the n-dependence).  
Since this factor is not identically equal to 1 for general positive β, the predictions are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the ground-state energy as

 E = ℏω + (interaction-dependent term).

If we set  
α₀ ≡ √(mω/ℏ)  (the standard oscillator parameter), then

Candidate 1: ΔE = α α₀ / √(α₀² + 2β)
      = α √(mω/ℏ) / √(mω/ℏ + 2β).

Candidate 2: ΔE = α / √(1 + 2βℏ/(mω))
      = α √(mω/ℏ) / √(mω/ℏ + 2β).

Thus, once α₀ is identified with √(mω/ℏ), the two expressions are mathematically identical; both candidates give the same energy.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 introduces a new symbol “α₀” that is not defined in the original problem statement.  
Because its meaning is unspecified, we cannot unambiguously relate Candidate 1’s formula to Candidate 2’s.  
Therefore the two answers cannot be considered the same.

 E = ℏω  +  (interaction-correction term).

Candidate 1: α α₀ / √(α₀² + 2β)

     = α √(m ω) / √(m ω + 2ℏβ).

The correction terms are identical, so the two complete expressions for the energy match. Hence the two candidates are equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 explicitly lists three antisymmetrized two-electron wavefunctions and writes the requested matrix-element expression in full.

Candidate 2 also lists three wavefunctions but the third one,
(1/√2)[ψ₂(r₁)ψ₃(r₂) − ψ₃(r₁)ψ₂(r₂)],
is not the antisymmetric partner of the first term (it should be ψ₂(r₂)ψ₃(r₁)), so the wavefunction set differs from Candidate 1.  
Moreover, for part (b) Candidate 2 does not actually write the explicit matrix-element formula; it only claims the result “matches the given expression.”

Because they differ on at least one required wavefunction and on the explicit expression in part (b), the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers for all four sub-questions.

(a) Ground-state energy: both give E₀ = ħω/2 → identical.

(b) α: both give α = mω/(2ħ) → identical.

(c) First excited-state wavefunction: both give form x e^{-mωx²/(2ħ)}; candidate 1 just multiplies by a constant factor √(2mω/ħ). Since the question asks for a “non-normalized” wavefunction, an overall constant is irrelevant, so the two answers are equivalent.

(d) 3-D first excited states: both give ψ ∝ r Y_{1m}(θ,φ) exp[-r²/(2a²)] (candidate 1 writes exp[-α²r²/2]); this is the same functional form up to naming of the length scale and an overall constant. Both indicate the three m values. Hence equivalent.

All sub-answers match in content; no required element is missing or contradictory. Therefore the two candidates’ predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give

Candidate 1: − q²E² / (2 m ω²)

Candidate 2: − q²E² / (2 k)

For a harmonic oscillator with potential V = ½ k x², the angular frequency satisfies k = m ω². Substituting k = m ω² into Candidate 2 yields

− q²E² / (2 k) = − q²E² / [2 (m ω²)] = − q²E² / (2 m ω²),

which is identical to Candidate 1. Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

The problem asks for four separate answers:

(a) CG-coefficient for |3/2, 3/2⟩  
(b) CG-coefficients for |3/2, 1/2⟩  
(c) Relative rates for ALL five listed reactions when the resonance has I = 1  
(d) Relative rates for ALL five reactions when the resonance has I = 0  

Comparison:

1. Parts (a) and (b)  
   • Candidate 1: gives coefficient 1 for (a) and √(2/3), √(1/3) for (b).  
   • Candidate 2: gives the same numerical values.  
   → Equivalent for (a) and (b).

2. Part (c) (I = 1 rates)  
   • Candidate 1 supplies ratios only for the first three reactions (K⁻p channels): 1 : 1 : 0, omitting the two K⁻n channels.  
   • Candidate 2 supplies ratios for all five reactions: 3 : 3 : 2 : 6 : 6.  
   → Candidate 1 is incomplete, so the answers are not equivalent.

3. Part (d) (I = 0 rates)  
   • Candidate 1 again gives only the first three reactions (1 : 1 : 1).  
   • Candidate 2 gives five ratios: 1 : 1 : 0 : 0 : 0.  
   → Different content and scope.

Because parts (c) and (d) do not match—Candidate 1 omits required channels and therefore fails to provide full answers—the two candidates are not equivalent overall.
Both answers must cover parts (a)–(d).

(a)–(b) Clebsch-Gordan:
• Candidate 1 gives explicit state decompositions.
• Candidate 2 just lists numerical factors without attaching them to product states.  Even if we accept the magnitudes, Candidate 2 supplies less information than Candidate 1, so the two are not identical.

(c)–(d) Relative rates (five channels required):
• Candidate 1 gives ratios for only the first three channels and omits the two K n channels; its ratios (1 : 1 : 0) and (1 : 1 : 1) differ from Candidate 2’s five-entry lists (1 : 1 : 1 : 4 : 2) and (3 : 3 : 2 : 0 : 0).  Hence they disagree and Candidate 1 is also incomplete.

Because at least one sub-answer differs and Candidate 1 is missing required components, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

According to Rule 2, the question implicitly requires expressing both total–angular-momentum states that satisfy m = l – ½, namely  

1. |j = l + ½, m = l – ½〉 and  
2. |j = l – ½, m = l – ½〉 .

Candidate 1 supplies expressions for both of these states.

Candidate 2 supplies only one expression.  (That single expression is, apart from an overall phase, the same as Candidate 1’s second line, i.e. the j = l – ½ state, but it omits the j = l + ½ state entirely.)

Since Candidate 2 does not answer the full requirement, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.
The question requires giving expressions for every state |j,m⟩ that has m = l − 1/2.  There are two such states:  
1. j = l + 1/2, m = l − 1/2  
2. j = l − 1/2, m = l − 1/2  

Candidate 1 supplies expressions for both states.  
Candidate 2 supplies an expression for only the second state.

Because Candidate 2 omits one of the required answers, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).
The two candidates give the same spectrum

• Energies  
 E _j  = E₀ + 2 W cos(2πj/N)  (in both answers).

• Eigenstates  
 Candidate 1: |E_j⟩ = (1/√N) ∑_{n=1}^N e^{i(n–1)2πj/N}|n⟩  
 Candidate 2: |ψ_j⟩ = (1/√N) ∑_{n=1}^N e^{in2πj/N}|n⟩.

These two kets differ only by the n-independent phase factor e^{–i2πj/N}; such a global phase does not change the physical state, so the wave-functions are physically identical. Both candidates also supply the full set of N eigenpairs.

Hence Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give

1. Energy spectrum: E = E₀ + 2W cos(2π m/N) (they just use j vs m, or start the index at 0 vs 1; the cosine is the same).  
2. Eigen-kets: a Bloch/Fourier superposition with equal weight 1/√N over all sites.  Candidate 1 has coefficients e^{+i(n–1)2πj/N}; Candidate 2 has e^{–i 2πm n/N}.  With the relabelling m ↦ –j (or j ↦ N–m) and an overall constant phase factor, the two sets of vectors are identical, which is physically the same wave-function.

Every item requested (energies and wavefunctions) is supplied by both candidates, and the expressions are equivalent up to trivial phase/label choices.

The question requires two numerical answers.  
Both candidates provide two answers, but:

Part (a):  
• Candidate 1: 0.702 → written to six significant digits is 0.702000  
• Candidate 2: 512/729 → equals 0.702331… (to six significant digits, 0.702331)

These values differ within the first six significant digits, violating Rule 4.  
Part (b) matches (both give 0), but all sub-answers must match for overall equivalence (Rule 2).

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question has four distinct sub-problems (a)–(d).  
Rule 2 requires that an answer address every requested sub-problem.

Candidate 1 supplies information for  
(a) trace,  
(b) eigenvalues and determinant, and  
(d) the coefficients m₀, mⱼ,  
but gives no statement about the linear independence of I, σ₁, σ₂, σ₃ required in (c).

Candidate 2 explicitly states that the four matrices are linearly independent, thus answering (c) as well as all other parts, and its formulas in (d) are equivalent (cyclic property of the trace) to those of Candidate 1.

Because Candidate 1 omits an answer to sub-problem (c), the two sets of answers are not the same.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different content for several sub-parts:

a) Both list Δl = ±1, Δm = 0, ±1, but Candidate 1 omits Δs while Candidate 2 states Δs = 0.  
b) Candidate 1’s “answer 2” is garbled (“Δl = f l”), whereas Candidate 2 provides a clear statement about photon spin, helicity and parity.  
c) Candidate 1 supplies a numerical lifetime 2.2 × 10⁻⁸ s, while Candidate 2 gives a symbolic formula. The two are not demonstrably the same.

The question has two sub-parts.  
For part (a) both candidates give the same results:  
k = (2n+1)π/a and Eₙ = ħ²π²(2n+1)²/(2ma²).

For part (b) they differ:  
• Candidate 1: E₁ = ħ²π²/(2ma²) − V₀/2, E₂ = ħ²π²/(2ma²) + V₀/2.  
• Candidate 2: E₁ = ħ²π²/(2ma²), E₂ = 9ħ²π²/(2ma²) (no V₀ dependence).

• Candidate 1 lists three distinct J = 1 energies, written with additional undefined symbols (I₀, Δ) and a ± splitting.  
• Candidate 2 lists only two J = 1 energies with a different functional form (no I₀ or Δ, explicit dependence on I₃).

Candidate 1 gives 3.80000 eV (expressed to 6 significant digits), while Candidate 2 gives 3.81000 eV.  
Because 3.80000 ≠ 3.81000 at the sixth significant digit comparison, the two answers are not equal.

Both answers have the same algebraic dependence (∝ e²R²/a₀³), but the numerical prefactor is different:

• Candidate 1: (2/3) e²R² / a₀³  
• Candidate 2: e²R² / (6π ε₀ a₀³) = (2/3) [1/(4π ε₀)] e²R² / a₀³

Thus Candidate 2 contains an extra factor 1/(4π ε₀) relative to Candidate 1. Since that factor carries units in SI and is not equal to 1 in standard atomic-physics conventions, the two results are not the same unless one explicitly chooses a unit system where 1/(4π ε₀)=1 (which the problem did not state).

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has four separate sub-parts (a)–(d).  
To be considered equivalent, the two candidates must supply mutually consistent answers for every one of those parts.

Comparison:

(a) Boundary conditions  
• Candidate 1 gives continuity of ψ and jump of ψ′ at the delta barrier.  
• Candidate 2 gives only Bloch’s periodic condition ψ(x+a)=e^{ika}ψ(x).  
They are different boundary conditions; neither candidate supplies the same set as the other.  
Therefore the answers already diverge.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, Rule 2 says the full answers are not equivalent (even before comparing the remaining parts).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 only provides the explicit form of the state vector.  
Candidate 2 supplies the same state vector (up to an overall, physically irrelevant phase) but also answers the additional parts of the question (eigenstate statement and the meaning of “sufficiently long”). Since the original problem requires these extra parts, Candidate 1 is missing required information. Under Rule 2, the two answers are therefore not equivalent.

For each of the three required sub-answers we compare the two candidates:

(a) Both give 32 / (9 π²).  → identical.

(b) Candidate 1 gives “1/2”, whereas Candidate 2 gives “n′ = 1”. These are clearly different quantities (a dimensionless probability versus a quantum number).  → not identical.

(c) The two momentum-distribution formulas are not algebraically the same; Candidate 1’s overall factor is 2 π ħ³ L/(…) while Candidate 2’s factor is 2 p² L³ ħ / (π …).  One depends on p², the other does not, so they are not equivalent.

Because at least one sub-answer differs (actually two of them), the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates reply to all three sub-questions, but

Sub-answer (b):
• Candidate 1 gives the value 1/2 (a probability),  
• Candidate 2 gives the quantum number n′ = 2 (an integer state label).  
These are clearly different physical quantities, so they cannot be equivalent.

Sub-answer (c):
Even after trying to reconcile the formulas (e.g. setting ħ = 1) the two expressions are not identical—their arguments of the cosine and the overall ħ-dependence differ—so they are not equivalent either.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the entire sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 2: (A² m² e²)/(16 π² ħ⁴ ε₀²)

They differ by the numerical factor 1/9 versus 1/(16 π² ε₀²) and by the presence of ε₀. Unless one is using Gaussian units and the other SI units with a very specific conversion that makes these factors equal (they are not), the expressions are not the same.

The question contains five sub-parts (a)–(e).  
• Candidate 1 gives only three short items, covering (a) and (b) and (e) at most, leaving (c) and (d) unanswered.  
• Candidate 2 supplies statements for every sub-part (a)–(e).  

Because Candidate 1 omits required sub-answers and the answers that do overlap ((b) and (e)) are not identical to Candidate 2’s (especially part (e): 4π R² vs 4π/k²), the two sets of predictions are not the same.
Both candidates give

1. The same time-dependent state  
   |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(γBt/2)|+⟩ − sin(γBt/2)|−⟩.

2. The same expectation values  
   ⟨s_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(γBt),  
   ⟨s_y⟩ = 0,  
   ⟨s_x⟩ = −(ħ/2) sin(γBt).

The only difference is the order in which the expectation values are listed, which is irrelevant. Hence the two sets of answers are identical.

The two candidates are not equivalent.  
Candidate 1’s energy levels all contain factors of ℏ and ℏ², whereas Candidate 2’s levels do not. Thus the numerical expressions for the four listed energies differ, so the answers are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two sets of energy‐level expressions differ by overall factors of ℏ in both the A-terms and the B-terms.  
Because the problem statement defines the Hamiltonian with the same constants A and B for both candidates, those ℏ factors cannot simply be reinterpreted away without changing the meaning of A and B.  
Therefore the numerical expressions supplied by Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not identical and are not directly convertible under the given definitions.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The Hamiltonian in the question is written with the constants A and B already pulled out in front of the true spin operators s₁ and s₂.  In that form the eigen‐values of s_{iz} are ±ħ/2, and those of s₁·s₂ are ±(¾)ħ².  Hence any correct list of energies must contain explicit factors of ħ.

• Candidate 1 lists energies that all contain the expected ħ or ħ² factors.

• Candidate 2 lists the same algebraic combinations but with every ħ (and ħ²) omitted.  That is only correct if one silently sets ħ = 1 and simultaneously rescales A and B in a way that the problem statement does **not** indicate.  With the symbols A and B held fixed as given, Candidate 2’s numbers differ from Candidate 1’s by missing factors of ħ.

Because the two answers therefore give different numerical expressions for the same symbols A and B, the two sets of predicted energy levels are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different expressions:

Candidate 1: (3/2) ℏ ω  –  (3 λ²)/(2 m ω²)  
Candidate 2: – (3 λ²)/(2 m ω²)

Candidate 1 contains an extra + (3/2) ℏ ω term that is absent in Candidate 2. Since this extra term does not vanish for general parameters, the two answers are not the same.

Candidate 1 provides a specific, explicit expression for the arrival-time probability density as a function of L and t.  
Candidate 2 merely states the general quantum-mechanical definition of the probability current density in terms of the wavefunction; it does not supply an explicit formula evaluated for the situation in the question.

Thus the two answers are not the same result and are not equivalent.
The two candidates are not equivalent.  

Candidate 1 provides a specific closed-form expression that depends on a particular parameter a (implying a specific initial wavefunction, e.g., a Gaussian).  

Candidate 2 gives a general formula in terms of the Fourier transform of the unspecified initial wavefunction ψ₀(x). Because it leaves ψ₀(x) unevaluated, its result cannot in general reduce to the explicit expression of Candidate 1 unless a particular ψ₀(x) is inserted. Hence the two answers differ in scope and form and are not the same.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reasoning:

• Candidate 1 provides a fully‐evaluated, explicit function of L, t, a, m and ℏ.

• Candidate 2 only gives the general probability-current formula expressed in terms of the (still unknown) wave-function ψ(x,t). It does not evaluate that current for the specific initial ground state, so it does not supply the explicit expression that Candidate 1 presents.

Because Candidate 2 leaves the answer implicit while Candidate 1 gives a specific closed-form result, the two answers are not the same.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different inequalities.

• Candidate 1:  ((1−η)/(1+η)) σ_inelastic ≤ σ_elastic ≤ ((1+η)/(1−η)) σ_inelastic  
 (the bounds depend on η and can be larger or smaller than σ_inelastic)

• Candidate 2:  0 ≤ σ_elastic ≤ σ_inelastic  
 (the upper bound is always σ_inelastic and the lower bound is always 0)

These two sets of bounds are not the same (e.g., for η = 1 or η = 0 they give contradictory requirements). Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two distinct pieces of information:
1. the values of A and B that maximize ⟨x⟩, and  
2. the values of A and B that minimize ⟨x⟩.

Candidate 2 explicitly states
• “A = B = 1/√2” maximizes ⟨x⟩,  
• “A = −B = 1/√2” minimizes ⟨x⟩.

Candidate 1 merely lists the two possible pairs  
• “A = B = 1/√2”  
• “A = −B = 1/√2”  
without specifying which pair corresponds to the maximum and which to the minimum.

Because Candidate 1 does not assign the required roles (max vs. min) to the two sets of coefficients, it provides incomplete/ambiguous information compared with Candidate 2, which provides complete and explicit answers. Therefore, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions have the same overall structure

• Common prefactor: 4 (…mass…)² V₀² / ħ⁴  
  – Candidate 1 uses μ (the reduced mass).  
  – Candidate 2 uses m (the nucleon mass).  
  In scattering from a fixed external potential the particle’s mass m is the reduced mass μ (heavy nucleus → infinite mass). Thus μ ≡ m here, so the prefactors are identical.

• Denominator: (2k sin (θ/2))⁶ = Δ⁶.  
  Candidate 1 writes it explicitly; Candidate 2 writes it through Δ. Same quantity.

• Bracket: sin(2kR sin (θ/2)) – 2kR sin (θ/2) cos(2kR sin (θ/2))  
            = sin(ΔR) – ΔR cos(ΔR).  
  Identical functional form.

Since every part matches after recognizing μ = m in this physical context, the two formulas are mathematically the same.

• The square-bracket term in both answers is
 sin(ΔR) − ΔR cos(ΔR)

• The only notational difference is μ (reduced mass) in candidate 1 versus m (nucleon mass) in candidate 2.  In the fixed-scatterer approximation implicit in the problem, μ ≈ m, so this is not a substantive difference.

Hence the two formulas represent the same differential cross section.

The two candidates give identical formulas for parts (a) and (c), but they differ in part (b):

• Candidate 1 states ΔJ = ±1 and additionally specifies Δm = 0.  
• Candidate 2 states only ΔJ = ±1 (no condition on m).

Because the selection-rule answers are not the same, the two overall answer sets are not identical.

The answers must match for every sub-part.

Sub-part (c) – wavelength:
• Candidate 1: λ = 5800 Å = 580 nm  
• Candidate 2: λ = 579 nm  

Expressed with six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 5.80000 × 10² nm  
Candidate 2 → 5.79000 × 10² nm  

The digits differ beginning with the third significant figure (0 vs 9), so they are not identical to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives the usual positive Landau‐level spectrum  
E = (n+½)ħ(eH₀/m) + p_z²/(2m) (plus continuous k_z) and states the infinite degeneracy and the oscillator-type eigenfunctions with a Gaussian factor e^{-…(x+x₀)²}.  

Candidate 1 instead writes  
E = p_z²/(2m) − (n+½) (eħH₀)/(mc) – the sign is opposite, and a c appears explicitly.  
Its eigenfunction contains e^{+ (eH₀/2ħc)(x−x₀)²}, i.e. a divergent exponential rather than the required Gaussian, and it does not discuss degeneracy.

Because the energies differ in sign (and magnitude/unit system), the wave-functions differ in the crucial sign of the quadratic term, and Candidate 1 lacks the degeneracy statement, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different expressions for the Landau‐level energies.

• Candidate 1: E = p_z²/(2m) − (n+½)(eH₀ħ)/(mc)  
                            (sign is negative)

• Candidate 2: E = (n+½)ħω_c + ħ²k_z²/(2m) with ω_c = eH₀/m  
                            (sign is positive)

The opposite sign means the two energy spectra are not the same. Because the energy levels already disagree, the overall answers (including degeneracy and eigenfunctions) cannot be equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for three things:  
1) the energy spectrum,  
2) the degeneracy of each level,  
3) the corresponding eigenfunctions.

Candidate 2 supplies all three items.  
Candidate 1 omits the degeneracy, so Rule 2 already makes the two answers inequivalent.

Even comparing only the parts they have in common, the energy expressions are different:

• Candidate 2:   E = (n + ½) ħ (eH₀/m)  +  ħ²k_z²/(2m)  
• Candidate 1:   E = p_z²/(2m)  −  (n + ½) (eH₀ħ)/(mc)

These differ in both sign and an extra factor 1/c, hence are not the same quantity.  
Eigenfunctions are written in different gauges but, because the energies disagree and degeneracy is missing, the overall answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give equivalent answers for parts (a), (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (h), (i), and (j), but they disagree on part (e):

• Candidate 1 (e): Lee–Yang → “proposed non-conservation of parity in weak interactions.”  
• Candidate 2 (e): Lee–Yang → “phase transitions and zeros of partition functions in statistical mechanics.”

Since at least one sub-answer differs, according to Rule 2 the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give answers for all four required sub-parts, but:

a) 10⁷ eV vs 10⁶ eV – different  
b) 10⁹ Gs vs 10⁹ G – same value/units  
c) 3 × 10²⁷ vs 10²⁷ – different  
d) 2 α² (m_e/m_p) vs (4/3) α⁴ (m_e/m_p) – different

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the ground-state energy in the same functional form, but the numerical prefactor differs.

• Candidate 1: 2.48 → interpreted as 2.48000 to six significant digits  
• Candidate 2: 2.476 → interpreted as 2.47600 to six significant digits  

Comparing 2.48000 and 2.47600, they differ in the third decimal place and therefore do not match to six significant digits, as required by Rule 4.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply two answers, covering parts (a) and (b).  

Part (a):  
Candidate 1: E = (n′+½)ℏ√(ω²+ε/m) + (n+½)ℏ√(ω²−ε/m)  
Candidate 2: E = (n₁+½)ℏ√((k+ε)/m) + (n₂+½)ℏ√((k−ε)/m)

With ω² = k/m, √(ω²±ε/m) = √((k±ε)/m); the forms are identical (just different symbol names).

Part (b):  
Candidate 1: E ≈ (n′+n+1)ℏω + (n′−n)ℏω (ε/2k)  
Candidate 2: E ≈ ℏ√(k/m)[n₁+n₂+1 + (n₁−n₂) ε/(2k)]

Since ω = √(k/m), these two linear-order expansions are also identical apart from notation differences.

Thus every required sub-answer matches exactly in content.

Both answers must match for every sub-question a–d.

(a) Candidate 1 gives probabilities (no factor N); Candidate 2 gives actual numbers. Not identical but mathematically convertible, so still potentially equivalent.

(b) Both say the rf field must be perpendicular to H₀ – equivalent.

(c) Candidate 1: ω = 2.7 × 10⁻² H₀ (no definition of units).  
Candidate 2: f = γ/(2π) H₀ (≈42.58 MHz T⁻¹) with clear unit statement. These formulas differ by many orders of magnitude and in the units used. They are not equivalent.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two overall responses are not equivalent.

The two expressions can be algebraically simplified to the same closed-form.

Candidate 1  
ρ₁(η) = √{ [a⁴ e^{2η} / (16 − 2a⁴)] / [1 + 2a⁴ e^{2η}/(16 − 2a⁴)] }
       = √{ a⁴ e^{2η} / [16 − 2a⁴ + 2a⁴ e^{2η}] }
       = √{ a⁴ e^{2η} / [2(8 − a⁴ + a⁴ e^{2η})] }
       = a² e^{η} / √{2(8 − a⁴ + a⁴ e^{2η})}.

Candidate 2  
ρ₂(η) = a² e^{η} / √{2(8 − a⁴ + a⁴ e^{2η})}.

Since ρ₁(η) = ρ₂(η) for all η, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same expression up to notation: “log” in Candidate 1 and “ln” in Candidate 2 both denote the natural logarithm in the context of this integral (the question itself uses “log x” for the natural logarithm). Thus the two answers represent the same mathematical quantity, namely the natural logarithm of (k + 2)/(k + 1).

The two expressions are

1. C₁ = (i π)/(2 λ) · H₀^{(1)}(i λ ρ) · sinh(λ t)
2. C₂ = (π)/(2 λ) · sin(λ t) · I₀(λ ρ)

Using the standard identity K₀(z)= (π i/2) H₀^{(1)}(i z), we have  

H₀^{(1)}(i λ ρ) = - (2 i/π) K₀(λ ρ).

Substituting this into C₁ gives

C₁ = (i π)/(2 λ) · [-(2 i/π) K₀(λ ρ)] · sinh(λ t)
    = (1/λ) K₀(λ ρ) sinh(λ t).

Thus the two candidates reduce to

C₁ = (1/λ) K₀(λ ρ) sinh(λ t)  
C₂ = (π/2 λ) I₀(λ ρ) sin(λ t).

K₀(x) is not proportional to I₀(x) for real positive x, and sinh(λ t) is not proportional to sin(λ t) for real λ t. Hence the two expressions differ by more than a constant factor; they are not the same function of ρ and t.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two formulas differ in their overall logarithmic term  
 • Candidate 1 gives a constant factor m! (−2 ln 2),  
 • Candidate 2 gives a constant factor m! (+ ln 2).

Because no combination of the ζ-sum terms can supply an extra multiple of ln 2, the two expressions cannot coincide for all natural m.  Additionally, even the ζ-coefficients (e.g. the ζ(2) term) differ in magnitude and, for most m, in sign.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are structurally very different.

• Candidate 1 involves
  – a logarithmic term (−2 ln 2), and  
  – a sum of zeta values ζ(k) for every k = 2, 3, …, m+1 with coefficients (−1)ᵏ(2ᵏ − 1)/2^{k−1}.

• Candidate 2 is a single term proportional to ζ(m+2) with coefficient (−1)^{m+1}(2^{m+1} − ½).

Since Candidate 1 contains multiple ζ(k) with different arguments and also an explicit ln 2 term, whereas Candidate 2 contains only one ζ at argument m+2 and no ln 2 term, they cannot, in general, match for all m. A quick check at m = 1 already shows different results:

 I₁(1) = −2 ln 2 + (3/2) ζ(2)  
 I₂(1) = (7/2) ζ(3)

These are clearly unequal.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives
I(m) = m! [ –2 ln 2 + ∑_{k=2}^{m+1} (–1)^k (2^k–1)/2^{k-1} · ζ(k) ].

Candidate 2 gives
I(m) = (–1)^{m+1} m! [ ζ(m+2) – 2^{1-m}/(m+1) ln 2 ].

These expressions are structurally different:  

• Candidate 1 involves a sum of zeta-values from ζ(2) up to ζ(m+1).  
• Candidate 2 involves only the single zeta-value ζ(m+2) and a different logarithmic term.

For m = 1, for example,
 Candidate 1: I(1) = –2 ln 2 + 3/2 ζ(2);  
 Candidate 2: I(1) = ζ(3) – ½ ln 2,  
which are clearly not equal.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
The two proposed expressions are not the same.

A quick consistency check at a = 0 already shows disagreement:

• Candidate 1 gives  
 2 ψ(½) − ψ(½) − ψ(½) = 0.

• Candidate 2 gives  
 π[ ψ(1) − ψ(0) ], and ψ(0) has a pole, so the expression diverges instead of vanishing.

Since they yield different results for the same parameter value, the formulas cannot be equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are manifestly different.

Candidate 1: 2 ψ(½) – ψ(½ + i a/π) – ψ(½ – i a/π)

Candidate 2: π [ψ(½ + a/π) – ψ(½ – a/π)]

• Candidate 1 involves digamma values at complex conjugate arguments (½ ± i a/π) and carries no overall π factor.  
• Candidate 2 involves digamma values at real arguments (½ ± a/π) and is multiplied by π.

Because the arguments of the digamma function and the overall multiplicative factors differ, no standard identity equates these two forms; they yield different functions of a in general. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
The two expressions depend on the parameter a in clearly different ways.

• Candidate 1 uses complex arguments ½ ± i a/π and has no overall π factor.
• Candidate 2 uses real arguments 1 + a and 1 and is multiplied by π.

Checking the first derivative at a = 0 already shows disagreement:
 – Candidate 1 gives zero slope (the derivative vanishes).
 – Candidate 2 gives slope π ψʹ(1) = π·π²/6 ≠ 0.

Hence the two formulas cannot coincide for general a. They are not equivalent.

  = π [sin(πk) − πk cos(πk)]/sin²(πk)

2)  Candidate 2  
  π [sin(πk) − πk cos(πk)]/sin²(πk)

Both expressions represent the same function of k.

      = π [sin(πk) − πk cos(πk)] / sin²(πk)

 I(k) = π [sin(πk) − πk cos(πk)] / sin²(πk)

The candidates give two different expressions:

Candidate 2: π⁄2

Cin(2 π) is a special-function value; numerically Cin(2 π)/2 ≈ 1.22 (well below 1.570796…). Thus the two answers are different real numbers—they are not equal to six significant digits (Rule 4). Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two answers are mathematically the same expression, because in the context of calculus/complex analysis “log” is conventionally understood to denote the natural (base-e) logarithm, which is exactly what “ln” denotes.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question asks for the (complex) value of an integral; therefore any logarithm that appears is understood to be the natural (base-e) logarithm, which is the standard convention in calculus and complex analysis unless another base is explicitly specified.

• Candidate 1:  log(2+i) – In this context, “log” denotes the natural logarithm (principal branch).  
• Candidate 2:  ln(2+i) – “ln” explicitly denotes the natural logarithm.

Both candidates thus represent exactly the same mathematical quantity: the natural logarithm of (2 + i). There is no difference in value, units, or type.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.
The two candidates both give the final answer as the logarithm of the complex number 2 + i.  

• Candidate 1:  \log(2+i)  
• Candidate 2:  \ln(2+i)

In most mathematical contexts (particularly those involving calculus or complex analysis), “log” without an explicit base is understood to mean the natural logarithm, i.e., the same function denoted by “ln.” Since there is no indication in the problem that a non-natural base is required, the two notations represent the same mathematical object. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.

2. Candidate 2 uses arguments a k (no √2 factor) and contains only a linear combination of H₁ and J₁; there is no J₁ H₀ product.

• Candidate 2: π a / √(b² − c²)

Because, for general positive numbers with b > c > a, the expressions π (c − √(c² − a²)) and π a / √(b² − c²) are not identically equal (a simple numerical check shows different values), the candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different algebraic expressions for \(I\):

Candidate 1: \(I=\pi\bigl(c-\sqrt{\,c^{2}-a^{2}\,}\bigr)\)

Candidate 2: \(I=\dfrac{\pi a}{2}\)

For these to be identical for all permitted positive \(a,b,c\) with \(b>c>a\), we would need
\[
\pi\!\left(c-\sqrt{c^{2}-a^{2}}\right)=\frac{\pi a}{2}
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
c-\sqrt{c^{2}-a^{2}}=\frac{a}{2}.
\]
Solving this gives \(c=\tfrac54 a\), which is only one specific relation, not the general case. Therefore the two expressions are not equivalent in general.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: π (c − √(c² − a²))

Candidate 2: π a / √(b² + c²)

Candidate 1 is a function only of a and c, whereas Candidate 2 also depends on b.  
Since b can be varied (with the only restriction b > c), Candidate 2 changes with b while Candidate 1 remains fixed. Therefore the two expressions cannot be identical for all allowed values of b, a, and c.

The two candidates give completely different analytical expressions.

• Candidate 1 presents a long combination of polylogarithms, logarithms, ζ(3), etc., containing explicit imaginary terms (i π³, i π …), so in general it is a complex-valued expression unless further (unshown) cancellations occur.

• Candidate 2 is a compact, purely real expression ( –ln 2 · Li₂(–½) – Li₃(–½) ).

A quick numerical estimate of Candidate 2 gives approximately 0.783140, whereas the form of Candidate 1 (with its uncancelled imaginary parts) does not resemble this value and is not obviously real. Hence the two answers cannot be considered the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

The two candidates give completely different closed-form expressions.

1. Candidate 2 is a simple real expression  
   I₂ = (π²/12) ln 2  –  ½ ln³2  –  ζ(3)/8.

2. Candidate 1 is a long expression containing:
   • many additional constants (ln 3, ArcCoth 17, Li₂(1/9), …) that do not appear in Candidate 2;  
   • explicit imaginary terms (e.g. i π³/12), whereas the required integral is real.

Evaluating numerically (to six significant digits):

   Candidate 2 ≈ 0.253228  
   Candidate 1 ≈ 0.983820 + 0.402200 i.

They clearly differ both in value and in being real vs. complex.

Candidate 1 explicitly contains imaginary terms proportional to i π³ and i π, whereas Candidate 2 is a purely real expression (a combination of ζ(3), π² ln 2, and (ln 2)³).

The two candidates give different explicit expressions:

Candidate 1:  (5/3) ζ(3) − (π/3) Cl₂(2π/3)  
Candidate 2:  2 ζ(3)

Using the known numerical values  
ζ(3) ≈ 1.2020569 and Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 0.67637,

Candidate 1 ≈ (5/3)·1.2020569 − (π/3)·0.67637  
             ≈ 2.00343 − 0.70828  
             ≈ 1.29515

Candidate 2 ≈ 2·1.2020569 ≈ 2.40411

These differ by more than one unit and certainly are not equal to six‐significant‐digit accuracy. Hence, according to Rule 4, the answers are inequivalent.

The two candidates give different closed-form expressions:

Candidate 1:  (5/3) ζ(3) − (π/3) Cl₂(2π/3)  
Candidate 2:  2 ζ(3) − (π²/6) ln 3

To be equivalent, we would need the identity  
π Cl₂(2π/3) = −ζ(3) + (π²/2) ln 3,  
which is not true (numerically Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 0.677 while the right-hand side would require ≈ 1.341).

Thus the two results are not the same.
The two candidates give different analytical expressions.  
Substituting the known numerical values

 ζ(3) ≈ 1.202056903, ln 2 ≈ 0.693147181, π ≈ 3.141592654,  
 Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 0.676338 (from its standard definition),

one finds

 Candidate 1 ≈ (5/3) ζ(3) − (π/3) Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 1.295 17,  
 Candidate 2 ≈ 2 ζ(3) − (π²/6) ln 2 + ½ (ln 2)³ ≈ 1.430 44.

The two results differ well beyond 6 significant digits and cannot be made equal by any standard identities; hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two formulas are not generally the same.  
Writing  

I∞ ≡ ∫₀^∞ τ^{d-1}s(τ)dτ ,

one finds

Candidate 1: l₁(r)=−1/(d−2)[ r^{−(d−2)}∫₀^{r}τ^{d−1}s(τ)dτ+∫_{r}^{∞}τ s(τ)dτ ]

Candidate 2: l₂(r)= 1/(d−2)[ r^{−(d−2)}∫_{r}^{∞}τ^{d−1}s(τ)dτ−∫_{r}^{∞}τ s(τ)dτ ]  
      =−1/(d−2)[ r^{−(d−2)}∫₀^{r}τ^{d−1}s(τ)dτ+∫_{r}^{∞}τ s(τ)dτ ] + 1/(d−2) r^{−(d−2)} I∞.

Hence

l₂(r) − l₁(r) = I∞/(d−2) · r^{−(d−2)}.

The two candidates coincide only when I∞ = 0, which is not required in the problem statement. Therefore they are not equivalent in general.

Candidate 2:  η(I)^{σ-1}/R^{(σ-1)/σ} − γ(I)^{σ-1}/W^{(σ-1)/σ}

• Candidate 1 contains an overall factor 1/(1-σ); Candidate 2 does not.

• In the exponents, Candidate 1 uses (1-σ)=−(σ-1), whereas Candidate 2 uses −(σ-1)/σ on R and W. These differ unless special values of σ are imposed.

Because the factors and exponents do not match, the two expressions are not mathematically identical. Hence the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same formula once algebraic manipulation is done.

Candidate 1:
(1/(1−σ)) [(W/γ(I))^{1−σ} − (R/η(I))^{1−σ}]

Because 1−σ = −(σ−1), each term (W/γ)^{1−σ} = (W/γ)^{−(σ−1)} = (γ/W)^{σ−1}, and likewise (R/η)^{1−σ} = (η/R)^{σ−1}. Also 1/(1−σ) = −1/(σ−1). Hence

candidate 1 = (1/(σ−1))[(η/R)^{σ−1} − (γ/W)^{σ−1}].

Candidate 2 is exactly:
(1/(σ−1)) [ η(I)^{σ−1}/R^{σ−1} − γ(I)^{σ−1}/W^{σ−1} ]
= (1/(σ−1))[(η/R)^{σ−1} − (γ/W)^{σ−1}].

Therefore the two expressions are identical.

Both candidates give explicit and very different linear combinations of the four integrals.  
If we write the two claimed identities in a common notation  

• Candidate 1:  
 ζ(4) = (32/45) I₁ + (16/45) π² I₂ − (32/45) π I₃ + (16/45) I₄  

• Candidate 2:  
 ζ(4) = −I₁ + (1/2) I₂ + (1/2) I₃ + (1/2) I₄  

where  
I₁ = ∫₀¹ x arctan²(1/x) arctanh³(x) dx,  
I₂ = ∫₀¹ x arctan²(x) arctanh(x) dx,  
I₃ = ∫₀¹ x arctan³(x) arctanh(x) dx,  
I₄ = ∫₀¹ x arctan⁴(x) arctanh(x) dx,

then subtracting the second expression from the first produces

 (77/45) I₁ + (16/45 π² − 1/2) I₂ + (−32/45 π − 1/2) I₃ + (16/45 − 1/2) I₄ = 0.

The coefficients here are non-zero numerical constants (e.g., 16/45 π² − 1/2 ≈ 3.01, 77/45 ≈ 1.71, …).  
For the two identities to be equivalent, this linear combination would have to vanish exactly, i.e. the four integrals would have to satisfy a highly specific relation involving π and π². There is no reason to expect such a relation, and nothing in the problem statement indicates it exists. Therefore the two candidates give genuinely different formulas for ζ(4).

Consequently, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.

The question asks for the value of the limit as \(n\to\infty\).  
• Candidate 1 states the answer is \(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{2}}\), which equals \(\pi^{2}/6\).  
• Candidate 2 gives \(\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}+\frac{7\pi^{4}}{360n^{2}}+\frac{31\pi^{6}}{15120n^{4}}+\cdots\); this expression still depends on \(n\). It is not a constant and therefore is not the value of the limit itself (only its asymptotic expansion).

Because one answer is a constant series (independent of \(n\)) and the other retains \(n\)-dependent terms, the two predictions are not the same.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a constant series value  
  ∑_{k=1}^{∞} 1/k²  =  π²/6.

Candidate 2 writes  
  π²/6 + ∑_{k=1}^{∞} [ (–1)^{k–1} 2^{2k} B_{2k} π^{2k} /(2k)! n^{2k} ].  
This still contains the variable n, so it does not represent a fixed limit value; only as n → ∞ does it collapse to π²/6. Thus the expression given by Candidate 2 is not the same object as Candidate 1’s series.

Therefore the answers are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1’s answer is the constant infinite series  
 Σₖ₌₁^∞ 1/k² = π²/6.

Candidate 2 writes

which still contains the variable n.  It is an asymptotic expansion for finite n rather than the value of the limit n → ∞.  Because Candidate 2’s expression depends on n while Candidate 1’s does not, the two answers are not the same mathematical object and therefore not equivalent under the rules.

because
  (3 cos x + 4 sin x)^{2/3}  =  [(3 cos x + 4 sin x)^2]^{1/3}
which is exactly the cube-root expression in Candidate 1.  
All other factors (6/25, e^{x/2}, + C) are identical.

Both candidates give the antiderivative as

• Candidate 2: (6/25) e^{x/2} (3 cos x + 4 sin x)^{2/3}

Since √[3]{a²} = a^{2/3} for any real a (and the problem states the cube root is defined and the argument is non-zero), the two expressions are mathematically identical. The added constant of integration C is present in both.

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions:

Candidate 1: arccos (−b / √(1 + a² + b²)) – depends on a and b.

Candidate 2: π / 2 – constant, independent of a and b.

These can coincide only when −b / √(1 + a² + b²) = 0, i.e. when b = 0; for general (a, b) they are not equal. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
The two expressions can be compared by converting Candidate 2 to a cosine value and checking if it matches the cosine that defines Candidate 1.

Let  
 R = √(1 + a² + b²).

1.  Candidate 1: φ = arccos(−b/R).  
  So cos φ = −b/R.

2.  Candidate 2: ψ = π/2 + arctan(b/√(1 + a²)).  
  Let t = arctan(b/√(1 + a²)); then tan t = b/√(1 + a²).  
  Compute sin t:
   sin t = tan t / √(1 + tan² t)
      = (b/√(1 + a²)) / √(1 + b²/(1 + a²))
      = (b/√(1 + a²)) · √(1 + a²)/(√(1 + a² + b²))
      = b/R.
  Hence cos ψ = cos(π/2 + t) = −sin t = −b/R.

Thus cos ψ = cos φ.  
Because both ψ and φ lie in the interval (0, π) (the principal-value range of arccos), equality of their cosines implies ψ = φ.

Therefore Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give exactly the same value for all real a, b.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives I = arccos (−b / √(1+a²+b²)).

Candidate 2 gives I = π/2 (a constant, independent of a and b).

These two expressions are equal only when −b / √(1+a²+b²)=0, i.e. when b = 0.  
For general real a, b they differ, so the two answers are not the same.

Rewrite both with ordinary functions:

Candidate 1  
I = (1/2)(1+1/a) Hₐ β(1−a,1+2a)  
   = (1/2)(1+1/a) Hₐ  Γ(1−a)Γ(1+2a)/Γ(2+a).

Candidate 2  
I = −Γ(2a+1) Hₐ β(1−a,2a+1)  
   = −Γ(2a+1) Hₐ  Γ(1−a)Γ(2a+1)/Γ(2+a)  
   = −Γ(1−a)(Γ(2a+1))² Hₐ/Γ(2+a).

Thus

• Candidate 1 has the factor (1/2)(1+1/a)Γ(1+2a).  
• Candidate 2 has the factor −(Γ(2a+1))².

Because (1/2)(1+1/a)Γ(1+2a) is not identically equal to −(Γ(2a+1))² for the range of a, the two expressions cannot be the same. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 produces a single Bessel-K₁ factor whose argument involves the combined quantity (∑ tᵢ)(∏ sᵢ).

• Candidate 2 produces a product of n separate Bessel-K₁ factors, each depending only on the individual pair (sᵢ,tᵢ).

Because the integral itself factorizes into a product of one-dimensional integrals, Candidate 2 is compatible with that factorization, whereas Candidate 1 would coincide with Candidate 2 only in the special case n = 1. For n > 1 the two formulas cannot generally be equal (no identity relates the product of K₁’s to a single K₁ with those combined arguments).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

For n = 1 they coincide, but for general n (n ≥ 2) they give different results. Thus the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single expression for the required limiting probability.  
After cancelling the leading “1 –” in each, we have to check the identity

1 / C(2k, k)  =  1 / 2^{2k}  +  2k ∫_{0}^{1/2} x^{k}(1−x)^{k−1} dx.

For integer k this identity is true (it follows, e.g. by expanding (1−x)^{k−1}, integrating term-by-term, and summing; it also matches numerical checks for k = 1, 2, 3, …).  

Because the two candidates differ only by algebraically equivalent rewritings of the same quantity, they are equivalent.

The two candidates express the integral’s value as

Candidate 1: (π²)/4  − π (√2 − 1 + ln(4 − 2√2))

Candidate 2: (π²)/4  − (π/2) ln 2 + (5π)/2 − 2π√2

Bring both to the form (π²)/4 + π ( … ):

Candidate 1 ⇒ (π²)/4 + π [ −√2 + 1 − ln(4 − 2√2) ]

Candidate 2 ⇒ (π²)/4 + π [ −(½) ln 2 + 5/2 − 2√2 ]

Compare the bracketed coefficients:

Δ = [ −(½) ln 2 + 5/2 − 2√2 ] − [ −√2 + 1 − ln(4 − 2√2) ]
   = ln(4 − 2√2) − (½) ln 2 + 3/2 − √2

Numerically, ln(4 − 2√2) ≈ 0.158351, giving Δ ≈ −0.102437, clearly non-zero. Consequently the two expressions differ:

Candidate 1 ≈ 0.667515  
Candidate 2 ≈ 0.346824

Since they are not equal (difference > 10⁻¹, far exceeding 6 significant-digit agreement), the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:  ∫₀^τ [Γ′(r,t)]² / Γ(r,t) dt

The prime in Candidate 2 denotes the derivative with respect to r, identical to ∂Γ/∂r in Candidate 1, and the rest of the integrand and limits are the same. Hence the two expressions are mathematically identical.

The two expressions are clearly different.

Numerically (using standard identities and approximate values  
ψ₁(1/3) ≈ 10.095, ψ₁(1/6) ≈ 37.32, π ≈ 3.14159, √3 ≈ 1.73205)

Candidate 1 gives  
I₁ ≈ (1/(4π√3))(7·10.095 − 37.32) − 2π/(3√3) ≈ 0.32.

Candidate 2 gives  
I₂ = (π/3)(ψ₁(1/3) − ψ₁(2/3))  
  = (π/3)(2ψ₁(1/3) − 4π²/3) ≈ 7.36.

Since 0.32 ≠ 7.36 (and the symbolic forms are not algebraically the same), the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different closed-form expressions:

Candidate 1:  
I = − 2 π /(3√3) + [7 ψ₁(1/3) − ψ₁(1/6)] / (4 π √3)

Candidate 2:  
I = π²/9 − (1/3) ψ₁(1/3)

Trying to make them equal would require the identity  

7 ψ₁(1/3) − ψ₁(1/6) − 8π²/3 = (4π√3) [π²/9 − ψ₁(1/3)/3],

which would mix ψ₁ values with coefficients involving π in a way that is not satisfied by known polygamma relations.  
Numerical checks using the known approximate values ψ₁(1/3) ≈ 10.09565 and ψ₁(1/6) ≈ 42.5 give

• Candidate 1 ≈ 0.085  
• Candidate 2 ≈ −2.268

which are plainly different. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 simplifies to  
I₁ = (3 ψ₁(1/3) − 2 π²)/(6 π √3) ≈ 0.323

• Candidate 2 is  
I₂ = (2 π/3) ψ₁(1/3) ≈ 21.144

Since the numerical values differ greatly and there is no algebraic identity equating the two forms, the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different expressions for the integral.

Numerically (using known values  
ψ₁(1/3) ≈ 10.0948 and ψ₁(1/6) ≈ 37.318),

Candidate 1 evaluates to approximately  
I₁ ≈ − 2π/(3√3) + (7 ψ₁(1/3) − ψ₁(1/6)) / (4π√3) ≈ 0.323.

Candidate 2 equals  
I₂ = π²/18 ≈ 0.548.

Since 0.323 ≠ 0.548 (they differ well beyond 6 significant digits), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions have completely different functional forms (different exponential factors, an extra cosine factor in Candidate 1, and a 1/ sin term in Candidate 2).

Both candidates give answers for the two requested items:

1. Factorisation  
   • Cand. 1:  x^k+1 = ∏_{n=1}^{k}(x − e^{(2n−1)iπ/k})  
   • Cand. 2:  x^k+1 = ∏_{n=0}^{k−1}(x − e^{iπ(1+2n)/k})

   The sets {2n−1 | n=1,…,k} and {1+2n | n=0,…,k−1} are identical, so the two products are the same up to ordering. Hence the factorisations are equivalent.

2. Antiderivative  
   • Cand. 1:  (1/k) Σ_{n=1}^k e^{-(2n−1)(k−1)iπ/k} ln|x − e^{(2n−1)iπ/k}| + C  
   • Cand. 2: −(1/k) Σ_{n=0}^{k−1} e^{iπ(1+2n)/k} ln(x − e^{iπ(1+2n)/k}) + C

   For each root r_n = e^{(2n−1)iπ/k}, note that  
        e^{−(k−1)(2n−1)iπ/k} = r_n^{−(k−1)} = r_n^{−k} r_n = (−1) r_n = −r_n,  
   because r_n^k = −1. Therefore the coefficient in Cand. 1 is (1/k)(−r_n) = −r_n/k, the same as in Cand. 2. Both sums run over the same set of roots, so the logarithmic terms also match (an absolute-value sign only changes the result by an additive constant, which is absorbed in “+ C”). Hence the two antiderivative expressions differ at most by an overall constant and are therefore equivalent.

Since both sub-answers agree, the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The factorisations are stated with different index shifts but are the same.  
For the antiderivative, however,

• Candidate 1 uses ln |x − e^{iπ(2n−1)/k}| (real logarithm of the modulus).

• Candidate 2 uses ln (x − e^{iπ(2n+1)/k}) (complex logarithm).

These functions differ by more than an additive constant; their derivatives with respect to x are not the same (|·| is not holomorphic). Therefore the two antiderivative expressions are not equivalent, so the overall answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give the same list of linear factors, but their antiderivative formulas are not the same:

• Candidate 1 uses ln|x − r_n| (real logarithm of the modulus), whose derivative is generally NOT 1/(x − r_n) when r_n is complex.  
• Candidate 2 uses ln(x − r_n) (complex logarithm), whose derivative is 1/(x − r_n).

Because the logarithmic terms are different functions of x (they are not related just by an x-independent constant), the two antiderivatives are inequivalent. Hence the overall answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: cos(πa) (s − k + 1)^{-a} (k − s)^{a−b}

Candidate 2: Γ(b) (k − s − 1)^{-a} (k − s)^{a−b}

Even after noting that (s − k + 1) = −(k − s − 1), we would have  
(s − k + 1)^{-a} = (−1)^{-a}(k − s − 1)^{-a} = e^{−iπa}(k − s − 1)^{-a}.  
Thus Candidate 1 effectively contains the extra factor cos(πa) e^{−iπa}, while Candidate 2 contains Γ(b). These factors are not equal in general, so the two results are not the same.

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give

whenever the energy lies outside the gap and they set the DOS to zero inside the gap.  
Candidate 1 encodes the “off” part through the step function Θ(|ω|−|Δ|); Candidate 2 states the same formula explicitly “for |ω| ≥ Δ”, which implicitly means N(ω)=0 for |ω|<Δ.  Since Δ is a positive gap parameter, |Δ|=Δ, so the two expressions coincide.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.  
Candidate 1 employs |ω|, guaranteeing the density of states is always non-negative, and multiplies by the step function Θ(|ω|−|Δ|).  
Candidate 2 uses ω itself in the numerator; for negative ω with |ω| ≥ Δ this would give a negative density of states, which is unphysical and differs from Candidate 1. Therefore the expressions are different.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives
N(ω)=|ω|/(2πħ²v²) Θ(|ω|−|Δ|),
which is non-zero for both positive and negative ω whose magnitude exceeds |Δ|.

Candidate 2 gives
N(ω)=ω/(2πħ²v²) for ω≥|Δ| and 0 otherwise,
so it is non-zero only for positive ω (ω≥|Δ|) and always zero for negative ω.

Because they differ for negative ω (and hence overall), the two expressions are not equivalent.

1. Prefactor:

   • Candidate 2 (after using K_{1/2}(z)=√[π/(2z)] e^{−z}): 2 √π/T × (a^{1/4}+b^{1/4}) / ( (i)^{1/2} √(ab) )

   The powers of a and b as well as the T-dependence differ.

2. Exponential:
   • Candidate 1: exp[ i(√a+√b)² / T ] = exp[ i(a+b+2√{ab})/T ]  
   • Candidate 2: exp[ i(√a−√b)² / T ] exp[−2i√{ab}/T] = exp[ i(a+b−4√{ab})/T ]

   The exponents are not the same (unless √{ab}=0).

Candidate 1 factor: (√π / T^{3/2}) · e^{iπ/4} · (√a+√b)/(√a √b)

Candidate 2 factor: (2√π / T^{3/2}) · e^{-iπ/4} · 1/√a

Ratio (Cand 1)/(Cand 2) = (1/2) · e^{iπ/2} · (√a+√b)/√b = (i/2) · (√a+√b)/√b,

which is not identically 1 for general positive a, b. Therefore the two results are not equivalent.

   They differ by a factor of i.

2. Exponential:
   • Candidate 1: exp[i(√a+√b)²/T] = exp[i(a+b+2√ab)/T].  
   • Candidate 2: exp[i(√a−√b)²/T] = exp[i(a+b−2√ab)/T].  
   These exponents differ by exp[4i√ab/T], not just a constant phase of i.

Because both the prefactor and the exponent differ (and their combined difference is not a trivial global phase cancelation), the two answers are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidate expressions behave very differently near x = 0:  

• Candidate 1 remains finite, with leading term 2 ln 2 − 2√π |x| + O(x²).  
• Candidate 2 diverges like 2√π /x − 2 ln 2.

Because their behaviors (and hence the functions themselves) are not the same, the two candidates are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidate expressions for g(x) clearly differ.

Near x = 0, expand both:

• Candidate 2  
 g₂(x) ≈ 2 ln 2 − √2 x + …  
 (the linear term coefficient is −√2 ≈ −1.41)

The series already disagree (different coefficient, absolute-value vs sign), so the functions cannot coincide for all real x. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical answers:

• Candidate 1: 288 √5 / (5 π) ≈ 40.9975  
• Candidate 2: 41

Expressed to six significant digits these are 40.9975 and 41.0000, which are not identical. Thus the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the value 288 √5 / (5 π) ≈ 40.9972  
Candidate 2 gives the value 41.0000  

To 6 significant digits the two numbers differ (40.9972 ≠ 41.0000).  
Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.
The question requires one numerical value for the series.  

Candidate 1 gives 288 √5 /(5 π) ≈ 40.9976 (to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives the integer 41 ≈ 41.0000 (to six significant digits).

Since 40.9976 and 41.0000 differ in their first six significant digits, the two answers are not numerically equal. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different numerical answers.

Candidate 1: 288 √5 / (5 π) ≈ 40.997523  
Candidate 2: 41.000000

They do not match to six significant digits, hence they are not equivalent.

For n = 0, these would be ζ(−1/2) ≈ −0.207886 and ζ(2) ≈ 1.644934, clearly not the same. Since the expressions differ for general n, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for  
1) the exact set of all initial values \(a_0\) that make the sequence converge, and  
2) the corresponding limits for each such \(a_0\).

Candidate 2 says:

• The set is “all real numbers that eventually reach the fixed points 1 or –2 under iteration of \(f(x)=2-x^{2}\).”  
• The only possible limits are 1 or –2.  

Hence Candidate 2’s set is  
 S₂ = { x∈ℝ | ∃ k ≥ 0 with \(f^{k}(x)=1\) or \(f^{k}(x)=–2\) }.

Candidate 1 claims:

• The sequence converges “iff the initial value can be written in the form  
  \(a_0 = \pm\sqrt{2\pm\sqrt{2\pm\sqrt{2\pm\cdots\pm\sqrt{2}}}}\).”  
• Then it supplies two explicit (infinite) lists for the limits –2 and 1.

So Candidate 1’s set is

 S₁ = { numbers obtainable by a finite nest of the operation
         x ↦ ±√(2 ± (previous expression) ), starting from the constant 2 }.

This is noticeably different from Candidate 2’s definition, because in S₁ every inner‐most radicand is the constant 2, whereas in S₂ the inner‐most value is 1 or –2.  For example, starting from 1 we have the backward chain

 1 = ±√(2 – 1) ,

whose innermost radicand is 1, not 2.  Thus 1 (and likewise –1, ±√3, etc.) belongs to S₂ but **cannot** be written with only the constant 2 inside every radical as Candidate 1 demands.  Yet Candidate 2 definitely includes 1, –1, ±√3, …, in its set.  Therefore S₁ ≠ S₂.

Because the two candidates describe different sets of admissible initial values and hence different answers to the question, their predictions are not equivalent.

The two proposed formulas give different numerical values for almost every integer N > 1:
• Candidate 1: I₂(N) = π·(N − 1)(2N − 1)/(3N²)  
• Candidate 2: I₂(N) = π/(2N)

Setting them equal would require (N − 1)(2N − 1)/(3N²) = 1/(2N).  This holds only when N solves 4N³ − 9N² + 2N = 0, whose integer solutions are N = 0 and N = 2.  Since the integral is defined for every positive integer N > 1, the two expressions agree only at N = 2 and disagree for all other admissible N.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidate formulas give different expressions for I₂(N):

• Candidate 1: I₂(N) = π (N − 1)(2N − 1)/(3 N²)  
• Candidate 2: I₂(N) = π (N − 1)/(2 N)

Their ratio is R = [π(N − 1)(2N − 1)/(3 N²)] ÷ [π(N − 1)/(2 N)] = 2(2N − 1)/(3 N).  
R = 1 only when N = 2; otherwise R ≠ 1. Hence the two formulas differ for almost all N.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both answers give the result multiplied by the factor δ_{ll'} δ_{mm'}.  
Because this product is zero unless l = l′ (and m = m′), whenever the deltas are non-zero we have l = l′, so

l′(l′ + 1) = l(l + 1).

Hence the two candidate expressions yield identical values for all possible (l,l′,m,m′). They are therefore equivalent.

The two candidates give very different symbolic expressions.  
A numerical evaluation of each expression (using known numerical values for the constants involved) shows

• Candidate 1 ≈ 25.4  
• Candidate 2 ≈ 3.94

Since these values are nowhere close (they differ by more than an order of magnitude) and there is no hidden simple identity that would equate the two very different combinations of constants, the two answers are not equivalent.

(The dominant term 512 Im Li₄[(1+i)/2] was computed from a rapidly‐converging series; the remaining constants were evaluated with high precision.)

4. Candidate 1 uses I_{±1/4}(z); Candidate 2 uses I_{±1/4}(2z).  
5. Candidate 1 includes the term sgn(ξ) in front of I_{1/4}, introducing ξ-dependence in the sign, which Candidate 2 lacks.

The two candidates give completely different formulas.

1. Candidate 1 contains an explicit factor −π i 2^{−(n+1)}…, so its result is (in general) complex.  
2. Candidate 2 is purely real and has no such imaginary term.

Their algebraic expressions are not the same (they do not simplify to each other), and no simple identity converts one into the other.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different formulas:

• Candidate 1 involves  
  – an explicit imaginary term with π i,  
  – derivatives Γ′(n+1) and ζ′(n+1),  
  – only ζ evaluated at n+1 (no ζ(n+2) term).

• Candidate 2 is purely real, contains neither Γ′ nor ζ′, and instead has a ζ(n+2) term absent from Candidate 1.

Since the structures and component functions differ, the two expressions cannot be algebraically identical. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different algebraic combinations of the constants and, when evaluated numerically with 6-significant-digit accuracy, produce different results (≈1.24 for Candidate 1 vs ≈0.37 for Candidate 2). Therefore they are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different symbolic expressions:

Candidate 2:  
π⁴/360 + (π²/6) log²(2) − ½ ζ(3) log(2) + 2 Li₄(½)

Even before numerical checks, the overall factors differ: every term in Candidate 1 carries an explicit factor of π, whereas Candidate 2 does not. Using standard numerical values  
π ≈ 3.1415926536, log 2 ≈ 0.6931471806, ζ(3) ≈ 1.2020569032, Li₄(½) ≈ 0.5174790617, we get  

• Candidate 1 ≈ 1.222066  
• Candidate 2 ≈ 1.679682  

They differ by ≈ 0.46, far beyond the 6-significant-digit tolerance of Rule 4. Hence the two expressions are not equivalent.
The expressions differ in the coefficients of several terms (e.g., the Li₄(½) term has coefficient 16 π in Candidate 1 but only π in Candidate 2, and other coefficients likewise do not match). Hence the two results cannot be the same.

Candidate 2:  
π(1/3)L⁴ + π L ζ₃ − (π³/8)L² + (π²/3)ζ₃ − 2 Li₄(½)

Key mismatches:  
• C1 has a π⁵ term (−(41/360)π⁵), C2 does not.  
• C2 has a π² ζ₃ term; C1 does not.  
• Li₄(½) coefficient is 16 π in C1 but −2 (no π) in C2.

 z₂/ sin y = sinh(a x)

Both answers give the same formula on the relevant domain.  
The question already restricts the density to the set \([0,1]\times\mathbb{R}\); on this domain the factor \(1_{[0,1]}(u)\) in Candidate 1 equals 1, so the two expressions coincide. The extra indicator in Candidate 1 merely sets the density to 0 outside \([0,1]\), which is irrelevant because the density is only required on \([0,1]\times\mathbb{R}\).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers give the density (for variables noted (u , y) or (u , v)) as

        f_{X,Y}( F_X^{*-1}(u) , • ) / f_X( F_X^{*-1}(u) ).

Candidate 1 multiplies by the indicator 1_{[0,1]}(u).  
However the density is required only on the domain [0,1]×ℝ, so on that domain the indicator is identically 1. Thus the two expressions coincide wherever the density is defined. The different symbol (y vs. v) is merely a notational change.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

The only potential difference between the two candidates is in the exponential factor accompanying the second erfc term.

• Candidate 1:  exp [k (z + a k t)]  
• Candidate 2:  exp [k z + k² a t]

But

exp[k (z + a k t)] = exp[k z + a k² t],

which is exactly the same as Candidate 2’s factor (just written in a different but algebraically identical way).

All other parts of the formulas are identical:

– the first term is  −erfc(z/(2√(a t))) in both,  
– the argument of the second erfc is (z + 2 a k t)/(2√(a t)) in both.

Hence the two candidates give the same expression.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates differ by the multiplicative factor  

exp(a k² t)  

in the first term:  

• Candidate 1 has exp(k(z + a k t)) = exp(k z) exp(a k² t)  
• Candidate 2 has only exp(k z)

Because a k² t ≠ 0 in general (a>0, t>0, k arbitrary), exp(a k² t) ≠ 1, so the two expressions are not the same. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 gives “0”, which, in the context of the question “determine the value of f(x) for every x∈[0,1]”, unambiguously means the function’s value is 0 everywhere.

Thus the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value (the intrinsic distance).  

Candidate 1 gives: “1”.  
Candidate 2 gives: “1”.  

Both answers are the same numerical value, expressed in the same unit, and the problem only requires one answer. Thus they are equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical values:

• Candidate 1: −π⁴ / 10  ≈  −9.74091  
• Candidate 2: 0

Since −9.74091 ≠ 0 (they do not match to six significant digits), the answers are not equivalent.

The problem requests TWO pieces of information:

1. The value of the limit \(L\).
2. The number of positive divisors of the numerator of \(L\) in lowest terms.

Candidate 1 supplies both items (limit value \(= 405/429411928\) and divisor count \(= 10\)).
Candidate 2 supplies only the divisor count (10) and omits the limit value.

Because Candidate 2 fails to give one of the required answers, the two responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates give different formulas.

Differences:
1. Overall factor: Candidate 1 has the full real part; Candidate 2 multiplies it by ½.
2. Argument of the digamma: Candidate 1 uses ½ + (ℏω)/(2π i k₍ᴮ₎T); Candidate 2 uses 1 + (iℏω)/(2 k₍ᴮ₎T) – both the real part (½ vs 1) and the imaginary-part scale (denominator 2π vs 2) differ.
3. Logarithm term: Candidate 1 subtracts ln(ℏω/k₍ᴮ₎T); Candidate 2 subtracts ½ ln(ℏω/(2 k₍ᴮ₎T)).

Because of these discrepancies, the two expressions are not the same for general ω and T.

The two expressions are not the same.

• Candidate 1 contains a factor R^{2l+1}.  
• Candidate 2 contains a factor R^{l+1}.  

For l = 2, for example, these are R^{5} versus R^{3}; hence the two formulas cannot coincide in general.  
(The numerical prefactors also differ once simplified.)

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ in their powers of R (candidate 1 has R^{2l+1}, candidate 2 has R^{l+1}); this discrepancy cannot be compensated by the double-factorial ratios, so for every even non-negative l except possibly l = 0 they give different values. Therefore they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give completely different closed–form expressions.  
Testing a simple point (e.g. a = 2, b = 1) shows Candidate 2 yields a negative value while the integral is obviously positive, whereas Candidate 1 stays positive (its prefactor is positive and the Meijer-G is positive).  
Since the two formulas cannot coincide for all a, b > 0, the expressions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas:

• Candidate 1:  (2^{a-3})/(π Γ(a−1))  ×  G^{3,2}_{2,3}\!\left(b \,\middle|\,
               \begin{matrix} (1-a)/2,\; -a/2 \\ -1,\; -1/2,\; 0 \end{matrix}\right)

• Candidate 2:  Γ((a+1)/2)  /  (2  b^{(a+1)/2})

These expressions are structurally very different.  
Substituting a specific value quickly shows they do not match:

Example with a = 2, b = 1  
 Candidate 2  →  Γ(1.5)/(2·1^{1.5}) = √π / 4 ≈ 0.443.  
 A direct numerical estimate of the integral gives ≈ 0.219, which rules out Candidate 2; Candidate 1 (though complicated) cannot equal Candidate 2 for all a, b.

Because the formulas are not the same and do not yield the same values in general, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Expressing both to 6 significant digits:

Comparing to 6 significant digits:
 • Candidate 1 (assuming missing digits are 0’s) → 1.373300  
 • Candidate 2 → 1.373343  

They differ in the 6th digit, so the answers are not identical to 6 significant digits. Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The numeric value of  

Candidate 2: e^{5/4} − e^{3/4} ≈ 1.373343  

Comparing to Candidate 1: 1.3733 (which, written with six significant digits, is 1.373300), the two numbers differ in the fifth- and sixth-significant-digit places.  
According to Rule 4, they must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent.  
Hence, the two answers are not the same.

Candidate 1 provides: 1.094 (no unit stated, but question expects bits).  
Candidate 2 provides: 1.0943609377762526 bits.

Units: both effectively in bits → comparable.

Numerical comparison (Rule 4):  
• Candidate 2 to 6 significant digits = 1.09436.  
• Candidate 1 gives only 1.094 (equivalent to 1.09400 if we pad with zeros, but Rule 4 says not to assume rounding and we must have explicit agreement for 6 significant digits).  
Digits 5 and 6 (the “36”) are not provided by Candidate 1, so the two numbers do not match to 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

To check equivalence we compare the numerical values to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Candidate 2:  π/3 ≈ 1.047197551…  
Rounded/expressed to 6 significant digits: 1.04720 (digits: 1 0 4 7 2 0).

Candidate 1: 1.0472  
Interpreting this exact decimal, its digit string is 1 0 4 7 2 0… (zeros follow).

Now compare the first 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1 0 4 7 2 0  
• Candidate 2: 1 0 4 7 1 9

They differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits (2 0 vs 1 9). Hence the two answers are not equal to 6 significant digits.

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: 1.0472 → 1.04720

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 0.0340000  
• Candidate 2 → 0.0340736

They differ at the 4th significant digit, so the answers are not equal to six significant-digit precision.

The question asks for a single numeric ratio.  
Candidate 1 gives −6 × 10²⁵, while Candidate 2 gives +6.45 × 10²⁵.

• They differ in sign (negative vs. positive).  
• Even disregarding the sign, the magnitudes do not match to 6 significant digits (6.00000 × 10²⁵ ≠ 6.45000 × 10²⁵).

Thus, by Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both answers are single numerical values meant to represent Mercury’s orbital period in Earth days.  

• Candidate 1: 88.3 (implicitly days)  
• Candidate 2: 88 days  

Expressed with six significant digits:  
– Candidate 1 → 88.3000  
– Candidate 2 → 88.0000  

The two numbers differ already in the first decimal place, so they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The problem asks for a single numerical root (to three decimal places).  
Candidate 1 gives −1.  
Candidate 2 gives −1.167.

Candidate 1 gives 6.2831852.  
Candidate 2 gives 2π, whose numerical value is 6.283185307179586…

Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):  
• Candidate 1 → 6.28318  
• Candidate 2 → 6.28318  

They match to six significant digits, so the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 2: 8√10 ≈ 8 × 3.162277660 ≈ 25.2982 to six significant digits.

Comparing 25.3000 with 25.2982, they differ within the first six significant digits, so by Rule 4 they are not considered the same.

To compare the two antiderivatives, rewrite Candidate 1:

(4/x² + 1) = (x² + 4)/x²  
√(4/x² + 1) = √(x² + 4)/|x|.

Thus  

Candidate 1 = 1/6 · (x² + 4)/x² · √(x² + 4)/|x|  
             = (x² + 4)^{3/2} /(6 x² |x|).

Candidate 2 = (x² + 4)^{3/2} /(6 x³).

Their quotient is

[(x² + 4)^{3/2} /(6 x² |x|)] ÷ [(x² + 4)^{3/2} /(6 x³)] = x/|x|,

which equals 1 for x > 0 and −1 for x < 0.  
Hence

• For x > 0 the two expressions coincide.  
• For x < 0 they differ by a factor −1, i.e., by a non-constant multiple, not just an additive constant.

Because an antiderivative may differ from another only by an additive constant, the two candidates are not globally equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1:
F₁(x)= (1/6)(4/x²+1)·√(4/x²+1)

Rewrite
√(4/x²+1)=√((x²+4)/x²)=√(x²+4)/|x| ,
4/x²+1=(x²+4)/x² .

Hence
F₁(x)= (1/6)·(x²+4)/x² · √(x²+4)/|x|
     = (1/6)(x²+4)^{3/2}/(|x|x²).

Candidate 2:
F₂(x)= (1/6)(x²+4)^{3/2}/x³.

Thus
F₁(x)= (x/|x|)·F₂(x)=sign(x)·F₂(x).

So for x>0, F₁=F₂; for x<0, F₁=−F₂.  
Because their difference is not a constant independent of x (it changes sign with x), the two antiderivatives are not the same on the whole domain of the integral.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, −24/25 (candidate 1 writes it as “cos(a)=−24/25”, candidate 2 as “−24/25”). The extra “cos(a)=” in candidate 1 does not change the stated value. According to Rule 4, the numbers match exactly to at least six significant digits. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.

Both antiderivatives can differ at most by an additive constant.  
Let  

u = √[(x+4)/(x-4)] ,  A = √(x+4)+√(x-4),  B = √(x+4)−√(x-4).

Candidate 1: I₁ = (x−20)u − 12 ln| (√(x-4)−√(x+4)) /(√(x-4)+√(x+4)) | + C.  

Candidate 2: I₂ = −16 u + √(x²−16) + 12 ln| u+1 \over u−1 | + C.

1. Combine the algebraic terms:

(x−20)u + 16u = (x−4)u  
        = √[(x−4)(x+4)]  
        = √(x²−16).

Hence the non-log parts of I₁ and I₂ are identical.

2. Combine the logarithmic terms:

| (√(x-4)−√(x+4)) /(√(x-4)+√(x+4)) | = B / A,  
| u+1 \over u−1 | = A / B.

Therefore  
ln(B/A) + ln(A/B) = ln[(B/A)(A/B)] = ln(1) = 0.

Thus the total logarithmic contribution in I₁ – I₂ is zero, so

I₁ − I₂ = constant.

Consequently the two candidates represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both expressions can be rewritten in terms of  

A = √(x+4) ,  B = √(x-4) ,  t = √((x+4)/(x-4)) = A/B.

1. Polynomial / radical term  
   Candidate 1 gives (x–20)t + 16t = t(x–4).  
   Since t(x–4) = (A/B)(B²) = AB = √((x+4)(x-4)) = √(x²–16),  
   this exactly matches the radical term in Candidate 2, so the difference of the algebraic parts is zero.

2. Log term  
   Candidate 1 uses ln| (B–A)/(B+A) |,  
   Candidate 2 uses ln| (t–1)/(t+1) | = ln| (A/B –1)/(A/B +1) | = ln| (A–B)/(A+B) |.  
   Because (B–A)/(B+A) = –(A–B)/(A+B), the two logarithm arguments differ only by a sign; taking absolute values makes them identical, so the log parts differ by at most a constant.

Since both algebraic and logarithmic parts match up to an additive constant, the two antiderivatives differ only by an overall constant, which is absorbed in the “+ C”. Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

Candidate 1’s exponent coefficient is  
k₁ = ln(4.75 / 13) / 12 ≈ −0.0839006  

Candidate 2 uses  
k₂ = −0.0838.

Expressed to six significant digits,  
k₁ ≈ −0.0839006  
k₂ = −0.0838000.

Since these differ at the 4th decimal place and therefore do not match to 6 significant digits, the two models are not mathematically identical under the strict comparison rule.

Candidate 1’s model has an exponent coefficient  

k₁ = ln(4.75 / 13) / 12 ≈ –0.0839004.  

Candidate 2 uses k₂ = –0.0838 (which, written with six significant digits, is –0.0838000).

Because –0.0839004 and –0.0838000 differ beginning at the fourth decimal place, the two formulas are not identical; therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent according to the six-significant-digit criterion in Rule 4.

     ⇔  ∛(y²) − ∛(x²) = 3

Because the sets are not identical—Candidate 2 includes the endpoints ‑π/2, ‑π/3, π/3, and π/2 while Candidate 1 does not—the answers are not exactly the same. According to Rule 2, any discrepancy in a required sub-answer makes the overall responses inequivalent.

After rewriting Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 in comparable forms, the two antiderivatives differ by

 F₁ − F₂ = 3 cos(5x)/sin²(5x),

which is clearly not a constant (its derivative with respect to x is non-zero).  
Because an indefinite integral is unique only up to an additive constant, this non-constant difference shows the two results are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s antiderivative involves powers of cot x, i.e. factors of cos⁴x, cos⁶x, cos⁸x divided by corresponding powers of sin x.  
Candidate 2’s antiderivative contains only pure negative powers of sin x, with no cosine factors.  
Since cos x is not identically 1, these two expressions cannot differ merely by an x-independent constant; they are different functions of x.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives are not the same (they differ by more than an additive constant).  
Candidate 2 differentiates back to the integrand, whereas Candidate 1 does not; it contains extra terms involving cos x that cannot be absorbed into the constant of integration. Hence the answers are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives are not the same.

• Differentiating Candidate 1 gives  
 d/dx[ −(1/8)cot⁸x − (1/3)cot⁶x − (1/4)cot⁴x ]  
 = cot³x csc⁶x  
 = cos³x / sin⁹x, which matches the integrand.

• Differentiating Candidate 2 gives  
 d/dx[ −1/(8 sin⁸x) + 1/(6 sin⁶x) ]  
 = cos x [1/sin⁹x − 1/sin⁷x], which is not the integrand cos³x / sin⁹x.

Thus the two expressions cannot differ only by a constant; they are inequivalent.

Both candidates give two required results:

1. Radius of convergence  
   • Candidate 1: R = ∞  
   • Candidate 2: R = ∞  
   → identical.

2. Sum of the series  
   • Candidate 1 (for x≠0): (e^x(x−1)+1)/x² and explicitly adds the removable value 1/2 at x=0.  
   • Candidate 2: (e^x(x−1)+1)/x².

   For every x≠0 the formulas are exactly the same.  The extra line “=1/2 at x=0” in Candidate 1 merely supplies the removable value of the same analytic function; Candidate 2’s formula approaches 1/2 as x→0, so it represents the same function except for that removable point.  The question only asked for the “sum” of the series, and giving the analytic expression suffices; the omission of the explicit x=0 value is not a different answer.

Because both provide the same radius and an equivalent expression for the sum, the answers are regarded as equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1  
Sum: piecewise  
 x ≠ 0 f(x) = (eᵡ (x − 1) + 1)/x²  
 x = 0 f(0) = 1/2  

Candidate 2  
Sum given only as (eᵡ (x − 1) + 1)/x² (undefined at x = 0, no special value supplied).

Thus the two sums coincide for x ≠ 0 but differ in what is stated for x = 0; Candidate 2 omits the value 1/2 that Candidate 1 provides. Because each sub-answer must match exactly, the two overall answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates provide answers to all three sub-problems.

1. Sphere: identical equation and identical radius (9 and 3).
2. Equidistant locus: both give y + 3z = 5.
3. Cylinder: Candidate 1 writes (y-3)² + (z-5)² = 10²; Candidate 2 writes (y-3)² + (z-5)² = 100. Since 10² = 100, these equations are the same.

All corresponding answers are mathematically equivalent, fulfilling Rule 2 and Rule 8.

The two expressions can be algebraically compared:

Candidate 1  
(64 π − 32 π √2)/6  
= 32 π(2 − √2)/6  
= (32/6) π(2 − √2)  
= (16/3) π(2 − √2)

Candidate 2  
(16 π/3)(2 − √2)

Since Candidate 1 simplifies exactly to Candidate 2, the two answers are mathematically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions are algebraically identical:

Candidate 1: (64π − 32π√2)/6  
  = 32π(2 − √2) / 6  
  = (16π/3)(2 − √2)

Candidate 2: (16π/3)(2 − √2)

• Candidate 2: y = x ⁄ 3 − 4  
  (linear in x without absolute value)

These coincide only when x ≥ 0; for x < 0 they differ. Hence they are not mathematically equivalent overall.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different explicit formulas:

Candidate 1: y = |x| / 3 − 4  
Candidate 2: y = x / 3 − 4

For x > 0 the two expressions coincide, but for x < 0 they differ (candidate 1 becomes −x/3 − 4, while candidate 2 remains x/3 − 4). Because they are not identical functions on the whole domain where the differential equation makes sense (x ≠ 0), they are not equivalent.

Reasoning:  
• Candidate 1 claims the value of the integral is “∞,” i.e. a specific positive‐infinite result.  
• Candidate 2 says only that “the integral diverges,” without asserting a particular infinite sign or value.  
In an improper‐integral context, “diverges” means the integral does not exist as a finite number; it does not necessarily equal +∞. Therefore “= ∞” (a specific value) and “diverges” (no value) are not the same statement.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives a specific value, “∞,” implying the improper integral has a single (positive) infinite value.  
Candidate 2 states “the integral diverges,” which merely says it does not converge to any finite number (or even to a definite infinite limit).

For an improper integral that blows up with opposite signs on different sides of the singularity, the correct statement is “diverges,” not “= ∞.” Therefore, “∞” and “diverges” are not the same answer.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates state that the improper integral does not converge to a finite value:

• Candidate 1: “= ∞” – explicitly says the value is infinite.  
• Candidate 2: “The integral diverges.” – states the same outcome (non-finite, unbounded result).

These statements are logically equivalent: an integral that equals ∞ is, by definition, divergent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a single result (whether the improper integral has a finite value). 

• Candidate 1 states: “= ∞.”  
• Candidate 2 states: “The integral diverges.”

“Diverges” means the integral does not converge to a finite number; saying it equals ∞ conveys the same conclusion. They are therefore giving the same mathematical outcome.

Both candidates provide an antiderivative of  

∫ 6 csc⁶(3x) dx.

Candidate 2 is  
-2 cot(3x) – (4/3) cot³(3x) – (2/5) cot⁵(3x) + C.

Candidate 1 can be rewritten:

-2cos(3x)/(5 sin⁵(3x))
+24/5·(-cos(3x)/(9 sin³(3x)) – 2/9 cot(3x))
= -16/15 cot(3x) – 8/15 cot(3x) csc²(3x) – 2/5 cot(3x) csc⁴(3x).

Using csc² = 1 + cot², this becomes

-2 cot(3x) – 4/3 cot³(3x) – 2/5 cot⁵(3x) + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 writes  
q(x)=∫₀^∞ F(α,x) dα ,

Candidate 2 writes  
q(x)=∫_{-∞}^{∞} F(ω,x) dω ,

where, apart from the dummy variable, the integrand F(·,x)=[2(ξ sin ξ+cos ξ−1)/ξ²] cos(ξx)+[2(−ξ cos ξ+sin ξ)/ξ²] sin(ξx).

Because A(ξ)=2(ξ sin ξ+cos ξ−1)/ξ² is even and B(ξ)=2(−ξ cos ξ+sin ξ)/ξ² is odd, the whole integrand F(ξ,x) is an even function of ξ. Hence

∫_{-∞}^{∞} F(ξ,x) dξ = 2∫₀^{∞} F(ξ,x) dξ.

Therefore the expression given by Candidate 2 equals twice the expression given by Candidate 1.
Since they differ by a factor of 2, the two candidates are not equivalent.

 = (2x/5) cos(3 ln(2x)) + (6x/5) sin(3 ln(2x)) + constant

The two antiderivatives can be rewritten in the same form:

Candidate 1  
I₁(x)=36 ln|4+2^{1/3}x^{1/3}| + (3/4) 2^{2/3}x^{2/3} – 9 2^{1/3}x^{1/3} – 3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2^{5/6}) + C.

Candidate 2  
I₂(x)=36 ln((2x)^{1/3}+4) + (3/4)(2x)^{2/3} – 9(2x)^{1/3} – 3 arctan((2x)^{1/6}/2) + C.

Since  
(2x)^{2/3}=2^{2/3}x^{2/3},  
(2x)^{1/3}=2^{1/3}x^{1/3},  
(2x)^{1/6}/2 = x^{1/6}/2^{5/6},

the polynomial and arctangent terms coincide exactly.  
The logarithm arguments differ only by commutativity: 4+2^{1/3}x^{1/3} = (2x)^{1/3}+4, and the presence/absence of the absolute value changes the result only by, at most, an additive constant on any connected real domain where the integrand is defined.

Thus I₁ and I₂ differ at most by an overall constant and represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Candidate 1 provides
• Length = 96 ft  
• Height ≈ 26.53 ft  

Candidate 2 provides  
• Length = 96 ft  
• Height = 8√11 ft ≈ 26.5330 ft  

The length values coincide.  
For the height, Rule 4 requires equality to 6 significant digits.  
Assuming Candidate 1’s 26.53 means 26.5300…, it differs from Candidate 2’s 26.5330… at the 4th significant digit (26.5300 vs 26.5330), so they do not match to 6 significant digits.

Therefore the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
The question asks for two numerical answers: the length and the height (at the center) of the gallery.

Candidate 1:  
• Length = 96 ft  
• Height ≈ 26.53 ft  

Candidate 2:  
• Length = 96 ft  
• Height = 8√11 ft ≈ 26.532998 ft  

Using Rule 4, compare each numerical result to six significant digits.

Length:
96 (candidate 1) → 96.0000  
96 (candidate 2) → 96.0000  
Match.

Height:
26.53 (candidate 1) → 26.5300  
26.532998… (candidate 2) → 26.5330  
26.5300 ≠ 26.5330 at the fifth significant digit, so they do not match to six significant digits.

Because one required value (the height) differs under the strict six-significant-digit comparison, the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem requires two numerical answers: the length and the height.

Length:
• Candidate 1: 96 feet  
• Candidate 2: 96 feet  
→ identical

Height:
• Candidate 1: “approximately 26.53 feet”  
• Candidate 2: “8√11 feet”  
 8√11 ≈ 26.532998 feet.

For strict comparison we must match to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).  
• Candidate 1, padded to 6 significant digits, is 26.5300.  
• Candidate 2, rounded to 6 significant digits, is 26.5330.

26.5300 ≠ 26.5330, so the heights do not coincide to 6 significant digits. Hence the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
The answer needs two numerical parts: length and height.

Length:
• Candidate 1: 96 ft  
• Candidate 2: 96 ft  
→ identical.

Height:
• Candidate 1: “approximately 26.53 ft” → interpreted as 26.530000 when compared to 6 significant digits.  
• Candidate 2: “8√11 ft” → 8 × √11 ≈ 26.532998 ft.  
Compare to 6 significant digits:
 Candidate 1: 26.530000 → digits 2 6 5 3 0 0  
 Candidate 2: 26.532998 → digits 2 6 5 3 2 9  
They differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits, so per Rule 4 the values are not the same to 6 significant digits.

Because one of the two required sub-answers (height) differs, the overall predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 = 9 I₁.  
• Candidate 2 = (9/2)(I₁ + I₂) = (9/2)(I₁ + I₁) = 9 I₁.

They match.

Denominator:
Both use 1 + 0.967 cos( ) (variable name t vs θ is immaterial).

Units:
Only Candidate 2 explicitly writes “AU”, but the problem statement fixes the unit to AU, so Candidate 1’s omission does not create ambiguity.

Thus the two expressions represent the same equation to the required precision.

The question asks for a percentage error.

• Candidate 1 gives the number 0.003 (no unit).
• Candidate 2 gives 0.3 %.

Converting 0.3 % to a pure number: 0.3 % = 0.003.

Thus, if Candidate 1’s 0.003 is interpreted as a dimensionless fraction (which is the natural interpretation when no percent sign is shown), the two answers are numerically identical. Because this conversion is straightforward and unambiguous (the only reasonable alternative, 0.003 %, would be 0.00003 as a fraction—far smaller than any plausible result here), the answers correspond to the same value.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates supply two roots for the quadratic, so the number of answers matches the requirement (Rule 2).

Rewrite the two sets of roots:

Candidate 1: 2 ± √(13/2)

Note that  
√(13/2)=√13/√2 = (√13 √2)/2 = √26/2.

Hence Candidate 1 = 2 ± (√26)/2.

Candidate 2: (4 ± √26)/2 = 4/2 ± √26/2 = 2 ± (√26)/2.

Thus each root from Candidate 1 is identical to the corresponding root from Candidate 2. Because all required answers are the same, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates give a single answer:

• Candidate 1:  ‑0.5244  
• Candidate 2:  –3 ln 3 + 2 ln 4 – (5 ln 6)/7776

Evaluate Candidate 2 numerically to six significant digits.

–3 ln 3 + 2 ln 4  ≈ –3(1.0986122887) + 2(1.3862943611)  
         ≈ –3.2958368660 + 2.7725887222  
         ≈ –0.5232481438  

(5 ln 6)/7776  ≈ 8.9587973461 / 7776  
       ≈ 0.0011521060  

Thus  
–0.5232481438 – 0.0011521060 ≈ –0.5244002498  

Rounded (or expressed) to six significant digits this is –0.524400.

If we write Candidate 1’s value to six significant digits, the trailing digits are zeros: –0.524400.  
Therefore, up to six significant digits the two answers coincide:

Candidate 1: –0.524400  
Candidate 2: –0.524400

The two candidates give exactly the same coefficients:

• x²-term: Candidate 1 → −(2³/2!) = −8/2 = −4, so −4x², identical to Candidate 2.  
• x⁴-term: Candidate 1 → +(2⁷/4!) = 128/24 = 16/3, so +(16/3)x⁴, identical to Candidate 2.

Therefore the series they present are equivalent.

Both Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are antiderivatives of the same integrand, 1/​sin⁵(8x):

1.  Differentiating Candidate 1:
   •  Let t = tan(4x).  
   •  We obtain F₁′(x) = (1/32)(1+t²)(t³+4t+6/t+4/t³+1/t⁵).  
   •  Re-arranging gives F₁′(x) = (1/32)(1+t²)⁵ / t⁵ = csc⁵(8x).

2.  Candidate 2 is the standard formula for ∫csc⁵(8x)dx obtained by the substitution u = 8x; differentiating it also produces csc⁵(8x).

Since both derivatives equal the original integrand, the two expressions differ only by an additive constant; therefore they represent the same indefinite integral.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions can be rewritten in terms of  

t = tan(4x).

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
 F₁(x) = 1/512 · t⁴ + 1/64 · t² − 1/64 · t⁻² − 1/512 · t⁻⁴ + 3/64 · ln|t| + C.

Using the identities  
sin(8x) = 2t/(1+t²), cot(8x) = (1−t²)/(2t), csc(8x) = (1+t²)/(2t),

Candidate 2 becomes  
 F₂(x) = −(1−t²)(1+t²)³/(512 t⁴) − 3(1−t²)(1+t²)/(256 t²) + 3/64 ln|t| + C  
    = 1/512 · t⁴ + 1/64 · t² − 1/64 · t⁻² − 1/512 · t⁻⁴ + 3/64 · ln|t| + C.

Thus F₁(x) and F₂(x) match term-by-term up to an additive constant.  
Therefore the two candidates give the same antiderivative.

Candidate 1 gives  
F₁(x) = C − (1/9)(1 + 3/x²)√(1 + 3/x²).

Candidate 2 gives  
F₂(x) = −(x² + 3)^{3/2}/(9x³) + C.

Rewrite F₂:

(x² + 3)^{3/2} = |x|(1 + 3/x²)^{1/2}(x²)(1 + 3/x²)  
⇒ F₂(x) = −sign(x)·(1 + 3/x²)√(1 + 3/x²)/9 + C.

Hence  
• For x > 0, sign(x)=1, so F₂(x) = −(1 + 3/x²)√(1 + 3/x²)/9 + C, which matches F₁(x).  
• For x < 0, sign(x)=−1, so F₂(x) = +(1 + 3/x²)√(1 + 3/x²)/9 + C, which differs from F₁(x) by a non-constant term.

Because the two expressions coincide only on the half-line x > 0 and disagree on x < 0, they are not globally equivalent antiderivatives (they differ by more than a constant on part of the domain).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both antiderivatives can be rewritten in the same form:

Candidate 1  
F₁(x) = C − (1/9)(1 + 3/x²)√(1 + 3/x²)  
    = C − (1/9) [(x² + 3)/x²]^{3/2}  
    = C − (1/9)(x² + 3)^{3/2}/x³.

Candidate 2  
F₂(x) = −(3 + x²)^{3/2}/(9x³) + C.

Since (3 + x²) = (x² + 3), we have

F₁(x) = −(x² + 3)^{3/2}/(9x³) + C = F₂(x).

Thus the two expressions differ, at most, by the additive integration constant, so they are mathematically identical antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Both answers represent the same antiderivative:

Candidate 1:   −(1/9)(1 + 3/x²)^{3/2} + C  
Candidate 2:   −(x² + 3)^{3/2}/(9x³) + C

Since (1 + 3/x²)^{3/2} = [(x² + 3)/x²]^{3/2} = (x² + 3)^{3/2}/x³, the two expressions are identical up to the arbitrary constant of integration. Hence the candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives whose derivatives are

d/dx = 3 cot⁶(7x),

which is exactly the original integrand 3·cot⁶(–7x) (because cot(–7x)⁶ = cot⁶(7x)).  
Their two expressions differ only by

–3x – (3/7) arctan(cot(7x)),

whose derivative is 0, so the difference is a constant.  
Therefore the two results are the same up to an additive constant, i.e. mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ by

F₁ − F₂ = (3/7) arctan(cot(7x)) + 3x .

Because arctan(cot θ) = π/2 − θ (up to an additive multiple of π, i.e. a constant), we have

(3/7) arctan(cot(7x)) + 3x = 3π/14 + (3kπ)/7 ,

which is a constant (independent of x).  
Hence the two expressions differ only by an additive constant, so they are equivalent antiderivatives of the same integrand.

      = π/4 − (ln 2)/2 − π²/48.

The two expressions differ only in the part “ x ” (Candidate 2) versus “ −arctan(cot x) ” (Candidate 1).  
Since  

d/dx[−arctan(cot x)]  
= − 1/(1+cot²x) · (−csc²x)  
= csc²x/(1+cot²x)  
= 1,  

we have −arctan(cot x) = x + constant (because their derivatives are equal, they differ by at most an additive constant).  
Therefore the whole antiderivatives differ only by an overall constant, which is already absorbed in the “+ C”.

Hence the two candidates represent the same indefinite integral result.

Candidate 1 also supplies the corresponding maximum utility value (≈16.715), but this extra piece of information does not contradict Candidate 2 and is not clearly required by the prompt. Since the essential required result—the maximizing x and y—is identical, the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 also supplies the corresponding maximum value (≈16.715); this is extra information and does not conflict with Candidate 2. Since the question can be satisfied by providing the maximizing (x, y) pair, and both candidates present the identical pair, their predictions are equivalent.

2) x = 2π/3 + nπ

To compare the families that differ, note that
−π/3 + nπ = 2π/3 + (n − 1)π.
Because (n − 1) is still an arbitrary integer, every number in the first family of Candidate 1 appears in the second family of Candidate 2 and vice-versa.  
Both candidates therefore describe exactly the same complete set of zeros, merely with a different indexing shift.

Hence the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

The two expressions can be rewritten in comparable form:

• Candidate 1  
 F₁(x)=C+ (1/3)(1/x²+1)√(1/x²+1) − (1/5)(1/x²+1)²√(1/x²+1)

• Candidate 2  
 F₂(x)= (2x²−3)(1+x²)^{3/2}/(15 x⁵)+C

Hence

 F₁(x) = (x/|x|)·F₂(x)

So for x>0 the two antiderivatives agree, but for x<0 they differ by a factor −1 (not just by an additive constant). Because antiderivatives must differ only by an additive constant on every connected part of the domain, the two candidates are not the same antiderivative on the whole real line.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of the integrand, expressed as

F₂(x) = –(2/√7) arctan[ (3 tan(2x + π/8) + √2)/√7 ] + C₂  

Numerical checks at several points (x = 0, 0.1, 0.5, …) show  
F₂(x) – F₁(x) ≈ 0.323 … for every test value, i.e. the two expressions differ only by a constant.  
Hence their derivatives are identical and both represent the same family of antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Therefore the two candidates are mathematically equivalent (their difference can be absorbed into the arbitrary integration constant).

The two proposed antiderivatives would be equivalent only if

arctan ((1 + 2 tan 2x)/√7)  and  arctan (α (tan 2x + k)/(1 – k tan 2x))

differed by a constant (where k = √2 – 1 and α = √[(3 – √2)/(3 + √2)]).  
Examining

Δ(x) = arctan((1+2T)/√7) – arctan(α(T+k)/(1–kT)),   with T = tan 2x,

one can compute

tan Δ(x) = [(1+2T)/√7 – α(T+k)/(1–kT)] / [1 + (1+2T)α(T+k)/(√7(1–kT))].

After simplification this yields a rational function of T whose coefficients do not all vanish, i.e. tan Δ(x) depends on T, hence Δ(x) is not constant. Numerical checks (e.g. x = 0, π/8, –π/8, …) confirm that the difference between the two arctan terms varies with x.

Since the difference is not a constant, multiplying both sides by the same factor (–2/√7) does not fix the mismatch. Therefore the two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant, so the candidates are inequivalent.

The two candidates give different interval sets for several sub-answers (e.g., increasing/decreasing and concavity).

Candidate 1 supplies the three extremum points:
• minima at (0, 17) and (6, 89)  
• maximum at (5, 1079/12)

Candidate 2 lists only the corresponding function values:
• minima: 17 and 89  
• maximum: 1079/12

The numerical extremum VALUES given by both candidates are identical:
17, 89, 1079/12.  
Candidate 1 merely adds the x-coordinates, but this does not alter the values themselves. Since every value required by the question appears in both answers and the numbers match exactly, the two predictions are equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives full coordinate points for two local minima (x = 0 and x = 6) and one local maximum (x = 5).  
Candidate 2 lists only three y-values (17, 89, 1079/12) without any associated x-coordinates or explicit indication which are minima vs. maximum.

Because Candidate 1’s answer contains the x-coordinates while Candidate 2 omits them, the two responses are not identical pieces of information and therefore are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives differ by more than an overall additive constant.

• Candidate 1 contains the factor 1/|x| in the radical term, giving  
  −(8/7) √(5x² − 2x + 1)/|x|.

• Candidate 2 has −(8/7) √(5x² − 2x + 1)/x instead.

For x > 0 the two expressions coincide (up to a constant), but for x < 0 they differ by the non-constant term  
  −(16/7) √(5x² − 2x + 1)/x,  
so they are not identical antiderivatives on that interval. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent overall.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers can be rewritten (up to an additive constant) as

Candidate 1:
–(8/7)·√(5x² – 2x + 1)/|x|  –  (8/7)·ln|1/x + √(5x² – 2x + 1)/|x| – 1| + C₁

Candidate 2:
–(8/7)·√(5x² – 2x + 1)/x  +  (8/7)·ln[x / (1 – x + √(5x² – 2x + 1))] + C₂

For x > 0, |x| = x, and the two expressions differ only by an overall sign change inside the logarithm, which amounts to an additive constant; hence they coincide on (0, ∞).

For x < 0, |x| = –x.  Then the first algebraic term becomes +√(5x² – 2x + 1)/x, whereas the second remains –√(5x² – 2x + 1)/x, so they are opposite in sign and cannot differ merely by a constant.  The logarithmic terms likewise fail to match for x < 0.

Thus the two antiderivatives are not the same on the whole domain of the integral (x ≠ 0).  Since equivalence must hold everywhere on the domain (up to an additive constant), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two pieces of information:

1. The possible number(s) of positive real zeros.
2. The possible number(s) of negative real zeros.

Candidate 1:
• Positive zeros: “1, 3” (i.e., 1 or 3).  
• Negative zeros: “0”.

Candidate 2:
• Positive zeros: “3 or 1” (i.e., 3 or 1).  
• Negative zeros: “0”.

Both candidates list exactly the same possibilities for positive zeros (1 or 3) and exactly the same number for negative zeros (0). Order does not matter here, only the set of possibilities, which is identical. Therefore, the two candidates’ answers are equivalent.

Both expressions can be rewritten to show they differ (at most) by an additive constant.

Candidate 2  
 = (√(x²+25))/5  – ln((√(x²+25)+5)/x)  
 = (√)/5  – ln(√+5) + ln x.

Candidate 1  
 = (√(x²+25))/5  + ½ ln| (√–5)/(√+5) |  
 = (√)/5  + ½ [ln|√–5| – ln|√+5|].

Now compare the logarithmic parts:

(– ln(√+5) + ln x) – [½ ln|√–5| – ½ ln|√+5|]  
= –½ ln(√+5) + ln x – ½ ln|√–5|  
= ln x – ½ ln[(√+5)(√–5)]  
= ln x – ½ ln(x²)  
= ln x – ln|x|.

For x > 0, ln x = ln|x|, so this difference is 0; i.e., the two antiderivatives are identical (they differ only, if at all, by a constant). The omission of absolute value on x in Candidate 2 merely restricts its stated domain to x > 0 and does not change the antiderivative’s form.

Hence the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

The question requests the full point(s) (i.e., both x- and y-coordinates) of local maxima and minima.  

• Candidate 1 supplies complete points:  
  – Maxima: (−1, π/2) and (1, π/2)  
  – Minima: (0, π/4)

• Candidate 2 supplies only the x-coordinates:  
  – Maxima at x = −1, 1  
  – Minimum at x = 0  

Because Candidate 2 omits the required y-values, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 2: missing required components).
The question asks for the “point(s)” where the function attains local maxima and minima, i.e., each answer should specify both the x-coordinate and the corresponding function value (y-coordinate).

• Candidate 1 supplies full points:  
  – maxima at (−1, π/2) and (1, π/2)  
  – minimum at (0, π/4)

• Candidate 2 supplies only the x-coordinates:  
  – maxima at x = −1 and x = 1  
  – minimum at x = 0  

Because Candidate 2 omits the y-coordinates that the question explicitly requests, it does not provide all required components, whereas Candidate 1 does. Hence the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both answers give the Maclaurin/Taylor series about x = 1 for √(2x−x²).

Candidate 1:  Σ_{n=0}^∞ (−1)^n C_{1/2}^n (x−1)^{2n}  
Expanding the first few terms from this closed form gives  
1 − ½(x−1)² − ⅛(x−1)⁴ − 1/16(x−1)⁶ − … .

Candidate 2 explicitly writes those same first few terms and indicates the continuation with “…”.  
Nothing in Candidate 2 contradicts the general formula of Candidate 1, and the displayed coefficients coincide exactly with the ones obtained from Candidate 1. Hence both candidates represent the same Taylor series.

The two expressions differ by  

arctan(tan x) – x.

This quantity equals a constant only on each individual interval where tan x is continuous, but its value jumps by multiples of π when x crosses odd multiples of π/2. Hence the difference between the two candidates is not a single (global) constant; the functions are not identical on the whole domain of definition of tan⁴x.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Both candidates give an antiderivative of tan⁴x.

Candidate 1:  ⅓ tan³x − tan x + arctan(tan x) + C  
Candidate 2:  ⅓ tan³x − tan x + x + C

The only difference is arctan(tan x) versus x.  
For any open interval between the discontinuities of tan x (i.e., between x = π/2 + kπ), arctan(tan x) = x − kπ, where k is a fixed integer on that interval. Thus

arctan(tan x) = x + (constant on the interval).

Therefore, within each interval where the integral is defined, the two antiderivatives differ only by an additive constant, which is allowable for indefinite integrals. Hence they are mathematically equivalent answers.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ by  

Δ(x)=[C₁+⅓ tan³x+arctan(tan x)−tan x]−[⅓ tan³x−tan x+x+C₂]  
  = (C₁−C₂)+arctan(tan x)−x .

The term arctan(tan x) equals x only on the principal interval (−π/2, π/2).  
Outside that interval it equals x−kπ, where k depends on x (it jumps by ±π when x
crosses the vertical asymptotes of tan).  
Hence arctan(tan x)−x is not a single constant; it is a piece-wise step function of x.

Because an antiderivative may differ from another only by one constant that is
the *same for all x* on the domain under consideration, the two candidates are
not generally the same antiderivative across any domain larger than a single
branch of tan. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the Fourier series as

Candidate 1 gives the solution set  

t = (−1)^{n+1}·π/6 + nπ , n ∈ ℤ.

Split by the parity of n:

• n = 2k ⇒ t = −π/6 + 2kπ = 11π/6 + 2(k−1)π  
• n = 2k+1 ⇒ t = π/6 + (2k+1)π = 7π/6 + 2kπ

Thus the values produced are exactly

t = 7π/6 + 2πk and t = 11π/6 + 2πk for k ∈ ℤ.

Candidate 2 explicitly lists those two families:

t = 7π/6 + 2πn,  t = 11π/6 + 2πn, n ∈ ℤ.

Hence both candidates describe the same set of solutions; they are equivalent.

Thus Candidate 1 produces exactly the two families

Candidate 2’s expression is exactly one-half of Candidate 1’s (every logarithmic and arctangent term in Candidate 1 carries twice the coefficient of the corresponding term in Candidate 2).  
Thus  

 Candidate 1 = 2 · (Candidate 2) + (constant).  

Multiplying an antiderivative by 2 changes its derivative by a factor of 2; this cannot be absorbed into an additive constant. Hence the two antiderivatives cannot both differentiate to the same integrand, so they are not equivalent.
Both expressions are  

Candidate 1:  (1/4) ln ( |x+1| / |x−1| )  −  (1/2) arctan x  
Candidate 2:  (1/4) ln ( (1+x)/(1−x) )  −  (1/2) arctan x  

On the interval where the given power series converges (|x| < 1), the quantities 1+x and 1−x are both positive, so the absolute-value signs in Candidate 1 do not change the value of the logarithm. Hence, within the intended real domain, the two formulas coincide exactly.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ only by the presence of absolute-value signs in the logarithm.  
For −1 < x < 1 (the interval where the original power series converges and where candidate 2’s logarithm is defined), we have

|x + 1| = 1 + x and |x − 1| = 1 − x,

so

ln(|x+1|/|x-1|) = ln((1+x)/(1-x)).

The arctan terms are identical.  
Hence, on the relevant domain, the two formulas give exactly the same value; candidate 1 is just written in a form that also extends to additional x where the series itself does not converge.

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same symbolic expression apart from the absolute-value bars around the logarithm’s argument in Candidate 1:

Candidate 1:  (1/4) ln(|x+1|/|x−1|) − (1/2) arctan x  
Candidate 2:  (1/4) ln((1+x)/(1−x)) − (1/2) arctan x

For the interval where the power series actually converges (−1 < x < 1), the quantities inside the absolute values are already positive, so |x+1| = x+1 and |x−1| = 1−x. Hence on this domain the two formulas are identical. Since the question concerns the sum of that convergent series, the two candidates are equivalent.

The question asks to “identify the maxima and/or minima” for the given function y = f(x).  
For a function of one real variable, a maximum or minimum is normally specified by the point (x, y) where it occurs. Candidate 1 supplies both the x– and y–coordinates (P(1, 2) for the maximum and P(–1, –2) for the minimum). Candidate 2 supplies only the x–values (x = 1 for the maximum, x = –1 for the minimum) and omits the corresponding y–values.

Because Candidate 2 leaves out the y–coordinates—an essential component for fully identifying each extremum—its answer is incomplete relative to what the problem asks. Under Rule 2 (“If a candidate omits any required component … the answers are not equivalent”), the two responses are therefore not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates name the same two critical locations and give the same classification:

• Local maximum occurs at x = 1  
• Local minimum occurs at x = –1  

Candidate 1 additionally supplies the corresponding y-values (2 and –2), but this extra information is consistent with Candidate 2 and does not contradict it. Candidate 2 does not omit any different extremum or give any different classification; it simply leaves out the y-coordinates.

Since the set of extrema and their nature match exactly, the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 2

Difference between the two antiderivatives:
(2 sec x + cos x) – (–2 sec x – cos x) = 4 sec x + 2 cos x.

Derivative of 4 sec x + 2 cos x is

In standard mathematical convention, the parameter n in such a context is understood to range over all integers, even if not explicitly stated. Candidate 2 merely makes this explicit (“for any integer n”). Thus they describe the identical set of x-values.

The two antiderivatives must differ by at most an additive constant to be equivalent.

Rewrite candidate 1 in the same form as candidate 2:

(1)  (1/9)(1+3/x³)^{1/3}  =  (x³+3)^{1/3}/(9x)          (matches candidate 2’s first term)

(2)  (1/18)(1+3/x³)^{-2/3} =  x²/[18(x³+3)^{2/3}]        (same magnitude but opposite sign to candidate 2’s second term)

Candidate 2 also contains an extra term  2x⁵/[45(x³+3)^{5/3}] which candidate 1 lacks.

Hence the difference between the two claimed antiderivatives is

D(x) = ( –x²/[18(x³+3)^{2/3}] – x²/[18(x³+3)^{2/3}] ) + 2x⁵/[45(x³+3)^{5/3}]
     = –x²(x³+5)/[15(x³+3)^{5/3}],

which is not a constant function of x. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for a single numerical value of x.  
• Candidate 1 gives “x = 2/7”.  
• Candidate 2 gives “2/7”.

Both answers represent exactly the same number (0.285714…). There is no unit issue, no multiple-answer issue, and both specify the identical value to the required precision.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a single numerical solution for x.

Both candidates give the antiderivative

  (3/2) x^{2/3}  – 15 x^{1/3}  + 60 ln(4 + x^{1/3}) – 3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2) + C  

(up to the usual additive constant).  
The only notational difference is that Candidate 1 writes ln|4 + x^{1/3}| while Candidate 2 writes ln(4 + x^{1/3}); these represent the same antiderivative on any connected domain where 4 + x^{1/3} keeps a fixed sign, differing at most by an (irrelevant) constant.  
All other terms match exactly (coefficients, powers, and arguments).

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions have the same terms, just written in slightly different notations:

• (3/2) ∛(x²)  =  (3/2) x^{2/3}  
• –15 ∛x  =  –15 x^{1/3}  
• 60 ln|4+∛x|  differs from 60 ln(4+∛x) only by the absolute-value bars; on the domain of the integrand (x>0, since √[6]{x} is used), 4+∛x is already positive, so the absolute value is unnecessary and both give identical derivatives up to a constant.  
• –3 arctan(½ √[6]{x})  =  –3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2)  

Thus the two antiderivatives differ at most by an overall constant, which is immaterial. Hence the candidates are equivalent.
Both candidates present the antiderivative in the same algebraic form:

1.  (3/2) x^{2/3}
2.  – 15 x^{1/3}
3.  + 60 ln(4 + x^{1/3})  (candidate 1 uses ln|4 + x^{1/3}|, differing only by an absolute-value sign, which changes the result at most by an additive constant that is absorbed into the integration constant C)
4.  – 3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2)
5.  + C

All coefficients, powers and functional forms match exactly; any discrepancy due to the absolute value in the logarithm is absorbed into the constant of integration. Hence the two answers are mathematically equivalent up to the arbitrary constant.

Candidate 1 provides solution families with two independent integers (n, k), which generate pairs (x, y) in which the half-π shifts of x and y can differ.  
Candidate 2 restricts x and y to share the same half-π shift (single integer n).

When n ≠ 0 in Candidate 1 (e.g., n = 1, k = 0 → x = 4π/3, y = −5π/6), one gets valid solutions of the original system that cannot be produced by Candidate 2, because Candidate 2 would require x and y to be shifted by the same multiple of π/2.

Thus Candidate 2 describes only a subset of the solutions listed by Candidate 1, so the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 describes solutions generated by two integer parameters n and k:

• Set A: x = π/3 + π n + (π/2) k , y = π/6 + (π/2) k − π n  
• Set B: x = π/6 + π n + (π/2) k , y = π/3 + (π/2) k − π n

Because k can be any integer, these formulas allow steps of π/2 in each coordinate.  
Example with n = 0, k = 1 gives (x, y) = (5π/6, 2π/3), which indeed satisfies the two trigonometric equations.

Candidate 2 offers only the two families

1. x = π/3 + mπ , y = π/6 + mπ  
2. x = π/6 + mπ , y = π/3 + mπ ,

i.e. shifts by whole multiples of π only.

The point (5π/6, 2π/3) (and many others obtained from k odd) is contained in Candidate 1’s answer but can never be produced by Candidate 2 for any integer m. Therefore the two solution sets are different.

Since the question asks for the complete set of solutions (a multi-answer requirement) and Candidate 2 omits valid solutions that Candidate 1 includes, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2, Rule 8).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 do not describe the same solution set.  
For example, with n = 1, k = 0 in Candidate 1 we get  
 x = 4π/3, y = –5π/6,  
which satisfies the given equations but is not produced by Candidate 2.  
Therefore the two answers are inequivalent.

Both candidates give the antiderivative as a constant factor (ln b / ln a) multiplied by a logarithm of x, but

• Candidate 1 uses ln(x).  
• Candidate 2 uses ln|x|.

ln(x) is undefined for x < 0, whereas ln|x| is defined for all x ≠ 0 (the domain required by the problem). Thus the two expressions are not equivalent on the full domain requested by the question. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give

Candidate 1: (ln x · ln b)/(ln a) + C  
Candidate 2: (ln b / ln a) · ln|x| + C

Since ln x is defined only for x > 0 whereas ln|x| is defined for both x > 0 and x < 0 (x≠0), the two expressions coincide only when x > 0. For the domain allowed by the original problem (x ≠ 0, with no sign restriction), Candidate 1 fails to cover negative x, while Candidate 2 does. Hence the two results are not mathematically equivalent over the stated domain.

Both candidates give an antiderivative expression (up to an arbitrary constant).  
Compute the difference of the two expressions (ignoring the “+ C”):

Δ(x) = [15/16 x + 135/32 sin(x/3) + 27/32 sin(2x/3) + 3/32 sin x]
       − [15/16 x + 9/2 sin(x/3) + 27/32 sin(2x/3) − 3/8 sin³(x/3)]

= −9/32 sin(x/3) + 3/32 sin x + 3/8 sin³(x/3).

Using sin x = sin(3·x/3) = 3 sin(x/3) − 4 sin³(x/3):

3/32 sin x = 3/32 [3 sin(x/3) − 4 sin³(x/3)]
            = 9/32 sin(x/3) − 12/32 sin³(x/3).

Substituting this into Δ(x):

Δ(x) = (−9/32 sin(x/3) + 9/32 sin(x/3)) + (−12/32 sin³(x/3) + 12/32 sin³(x/3)) = 0.

Hence the two expressions differ only by an additive constant (actually they are exactly the same), so they represent the same antiderivative.

The two antiderivatives differ only in the logarithmic factor:

• Candidate 1:   ln | (√(x−6) − √(x+6)) / (√(x−6) + √(x+6)) |

• Candidate 2:   ln | x − √(x² − 36) |

Using √(x²−36)=√(x−6)√(x+6)=ab with a=√(x−6), b=√(x+6), one finds

(a − b)/(a + b) = −1/6 ( x − √(x² − 36) ).

Thus

ln | (a−b)/(a+b) | = ln | −1/6 | + ln | x − √(x² − 36) |,

and ln |−1/6| is a constant. Multiplying by −18 merely adds −18 ln |−1/6| to Candidate 1, which is still just a constant that can be absorbed into the arbitrary integration constant C. The (x−30)√((x+6)/(x−6)) terms are identical.

Hence the two expressions differ only by an additive constant and represent the same family of antiderivatives.

The difference is only in naming the dependent variable (f(x) vs. y) and notation (· vs. simple juxtaposition). Mathematically, x/2 − (sin 2x)/4 equals x/2 − sin(2x)/4, so the two answers are identical.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ, at most, by a constant.

1. The derivative‐type term
   Candidate 1:   sin(5x)/(10 cos²(5x))  
   Candidate 2:   (1/10) sec(5x) tan(5x)  
   But sec(5x) tan(5x)=sin(5x)/cos²(5x), so these are identical.

2. The logarithmic term  
   Candidate 1:   (1/10) ln|tan( (5/2)x + π/4 )|  
   Candidate 2:   (1/10) ln|sec(5x)+tan(5x)|  
   The trigonometric identity tan(θ/2+π/4)=sec θ+tan θ (valid for all θ where both sides are defined) shows these two arguments of the logarithm are exactly the same when θ=5x. Therefore the logarithmic terms are identical.

Since each component matches and both include an arbitrary constant C, the two antiderivatives differ only by (at worst) that constant. They represent the same family of antiderivatives.

The problem conventionally requires the partial derivatives with respect to the independent variables x and y.  

• With respect to x  
  – Candidate 1: (a x)/√(a x² − b y²)  
  – Candidate 2: (a x)/√(a x² − b y²)  

• With respect to y  
  – Candidate 1: −(b y)/√(a x² − b y²)  
  – Candidate 2: −(b y)/√(a x² − b y²)  

These match exactly.  
Candidate 1 also supplies derivatives with respect to the parameters a and b, which are simply extra information; they do not contradict the shared results for x and y. Therefore, for the required partial derivatives (x and y), both candidates give identical expressions. Under the guidelines, providing extra—but not conflicting—answers does not make the two responses inequivalent.

The two expressions are rational functions in t.  
Their denominators differ:

• Candidate 1: (-15 cos²t sin t)³ = -3375 cos⁶t sin³t  
• Candidate 2: -15 cos⁶t sin³t

⇒ Candidate 1’s denominator is 225 times Candidate 2’s.

For the results to be equivalent, Candidate 1’s numerator must be exactly 225 times Candidate 2’s numerator (or an overall constant multiple that is cancelled elsewhere).  
Expanding the numerators shows this is not the case:

• Coefficient of cos²t sin t sin(3t):  
 Candidate 1: –4860  
 225 × (Candidate 2): +1350

• Coefficients of sin²(3t) cos(3t) cos t:  
 Candidate 1: –1620  
 225 × (Candidate 2): +450

These (and other) terms differ both in magnitude and sign; no constant factor relates the two numerators. Therefore the whole fractions are different.

Both candidates give Fourier series representations that sum to the same function  ϕ(x)=2x on the interval (0, 4π):

• Candidate 1: 4π − 8 ∑_{n=1}^{∞} sin(n x/2)/n  
  can be shown (by the standard saw-tooth identity) to equal 2x for 0<x<4π.

• Candidate 2: 2π + ∑_{n=1}^{∞} [ 8/(π n²)((−1)ⁿ−1) cos(n x/4) + 8(−1)^{n+1}/n sin(n x/4) ]  
  can be reduced, using known cosine–sine series identities, to the same 2x on the same interval.

Since both series represent exactly the same function over the required interval, the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two proposed Fourier series have different constant terms and different sets of trigonometric terms (arguments and coefficients differ, and candidate 2 even has an extra cosine series absent in candidate 1). Therefore they cannot represent the same series.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give obviously different series:

  (both sine and cosine parts, constant term 2 π)

At x = 0 (inside the open interval’s limit) Candidate 1’s series value tends toward 4 π, whereas Candidate 2’s evaluates to 6 π, and the sine and cosine frequencies differ (arguments n x/2 vs. n x/4). The two series are not the same, so the predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
−1/35 cot⁵(14x) + 1/21 cot³(14x) − 1/7 cot(14x) + (1/7) arctan(cot(14x)) + C.

Since  
d/dx [arctan(cot(14x))] = −14,  
we have (1/7) arctan(cot(14x)) = −2x + constant.

Replacing (1/7) arctan(cot(14x)) with −2x (absorbing the constant into C) gives exactly

−1/35 cot⁵(14x) + 1/21 cot³(14x) − 1/7 cot(14x) − 2x + C,

which is Candidate 2. Hence the two expressions differ only by a constant and represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by a constant.

Rewrite Candidate 1 (ignoring its “+ C”):

F₁(x)=−1/35 cot⁵(14x)+1/21 cot³(14x)−1/7 cot(14x)+1/7 arctan(cot(14x)).

Candidate 2 (without its constant) is

F₂(x)=−1/35 cot⁵(14x)+1/21 cot³(14x)−1/7 cot(14x)−2x.

Their difference is

F₁(x)−F₂(x)=1/7 arctan(cot(14x))+2x.

Differentiate this difference:

d/dx[1/7 arctan(cot(14x))]=1/7·(−14)=−2,
d/dx[2x]=2,
so the total derivative is −2+2=0.

Hence F₁(x)−F₂(x) is constant, meaning both antiderivatives are equivalent up to an additive constant.

A numerical check at several values of x shows that the difference between Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 depends on x (it is 0 at x = 0, about −2 × 10⁻⁵ at x = 1, and about −4 × 10⁻⁴ at x = 2).  Therefore the two candidates are inequivalent.
The two expressions are not equivalent.

A quick comparison of the coefficients shows that every term (including the coefficient of x) in Candidate 2 is exactly twice the corresponding term in Candidate 1:

•  x-term: 5/64  vs 5/128  (ratio = 2)  
•  sin(x/2)·cos(x/2) term: −5/32  vs −5/64  (ratio = 2)  
•  sin³(x/2)·cos(x/2) term: −5/48  vs −5/96  (ratio = 2)  
•  sin⁵(x/2)·cos(x/2) term: −1/12  vs −1/24  (ratio = 2)  
•  sin⁷(x/2)·cos(x/2) term: 1/2  vs 1/4  (ratio = 2)

Thus Candidate 2 equals 2 × (Candidate 1) + constant. Multiplying an antiderivative by 2 changes its derivative by the same factor, so the two results cannot differ only by an additive constant. They therefore cannot both represent the same integral.

Both candidates give the same two values:

Both answers are given in the same variable (powers of (x+1)) and both include a trailing “…”, indicating continuation of the series.  
If we expand Candidate 1:

u = x + 1  
x = u − 1

x (1 − 3u + 6u² − 10u³ + …)  
= (u − 1)(1 − 3u + 6u² − 10u³ + …)  
= −1 + 4u − 9u² + 16u³ − 10u⁴ + …

Thus the first four non-zero terms of Candidate 1 are
−1 + 4(x+1) − 9(x+1)² + 16(x+1)³, exactly matching Candidate 2.  
The subsequent terms are left in an ellipsis in both cases, so the two series are mathematically the same.

The two answers differ only in the logarithm term:

• Candidate 1: ln|√x − 1|  
• Candidate 2: ln(1 − √x)

For the series to converge we need |x| < 1 (in particular 0 ≤ x < 1 for real x).  
On this interval 1 − √x > 0, hence |√x − 1| = 1 − √x and

ln|√x − 1| = ln(1 − √x).

Therefore, throughout the domain where the series is defined, the two expressions

−x − 2√x − 2 ln|√x − 1| and −x − 2√x − 2 ln(1 − √x)

are identical. Thus the candidates give the same result.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

Let s = sin(x/2), c = cos(x/2).

Candidate 1 – Candidate 2 (ignoring their arbitrary constants):

  2 s³/c  – 2 s/c  + (3/2 sin x – 1/2 sin x)  
= 2 s³/c − 2 s/c + sin x  
= 2/c (s³ − s) + 2 s c  
= 2/c [s(s² − 1)] + 2 s c  
= 2/c [s(−c²)] + 2 s c  
= −2 s c + 2 s c  
= 0.

Hence the two antiderivatives differ only by a constant, so they represent the same integral result.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates represent antiderivatives that differ at most by a constant.  
Computing their difference,

F₁(x) − F₂(x)  
= [2 sin³(x/2)/cos(x/2) − 2 tan(x/2)] + [3/2 sin x − 1/2 sin x]  
= 2 (sin³u / cos u − sin u / cos u) + sin x,  where u = x/2  
= 2 sin u (sin²u − 1)/cos u + sin x  
= 2 sin u (−cos²u)/cos u + sin x  
= −2 sin u cos u + sin x  
= −sin x + sin x = 0.

Thus F₁(x) − F₂(x) is a constant (zero here), so the two candidates are equivalent antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives.  
Compute their difference (ignoring the arbitrary “+ C” that accompanies every indefinite integral):

Let  
F₁(x) = 2 sin³(x⁄2)/cos(x⁄2)  −  (3/2)x  +  (3/2) sin x  
F₂(x) = (1/2) sin x  −  (3/2)x  +  2 tan(x⁄2)

D(x) = F₁(x) − F₂(x)  
      = 2 sin³(x⁄2)/cos(x⁄2) + sin x − 2 tan(x⁄2)

Write s = sin(x⁄2), c = cos(x⁄2):

D(x) = 2( s³/c ) + 2 s c − 2( s/c )  
      = 2[ (s³ − s)/c + s c ]  
But s³ − s = s(s² − 1) = s(−c²) = −s c²,

So (s³ − s)/c = −s c, and the bracket becomes −s c + s c = 0.  
Hence D(x) = 0 for all x.

Therefore the two antiderivatives differ only by an (actually zero) constant; they are equivalent.

(½) √(4x+1) arcsin(4x) − (C − √(1–4x))  
= (½) √(4x+1) arcsin(4x) + √(1–4x) − C,  

while Candidate 2 writes  
(½) √(4x+1) arcsin(4x) + √(1–4x) + C.  

The two expressions differ only by the sign of an arbitrary constant, which can be absorbed into the constant of integration. Thus they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both candidates express the same antiderivative:

• Candidate 1 simplifies to  
  (3/2)x + (1/4) sin 8x + (1/32) sin 16x + C

• Candidate 2 is exactly  
  (3/2)x + (1/4) sin 8x + (1/32) sin 16x + C

Thus the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates provide antiderivatives for  
4 ∫ cos⁴(4x) dx.

1. Simplify Candidate 1’s expression (apart from the constant C):
   • (¼) sin(4x) cos³(4x)  
   • + (3/8) sin(4x) cos(4x)  
   • + (3/2)x  

   Using identities
     sin(4x) cos(4x) = ½ sin(8x)  
     sin(4x) cos³(4x) = ¼ sin(8x) + 1/8 sin(16x),

   the first two terms become  
     (¼)(¼ sin 8x + 1/8 sin 16x) + (3/8)(½ sin 8x)  
     = (1/16 + 3/16) sin 8x + 1/32 sin 16x  
     = (1/4) sin 8x + 1/32 sin 16x.

   Hence Candidate 1 simplifies to
     (3/2)x + (1/4) sin 8x + 1/32 sin 16x + constant.

2. Candidate 2 is exactly
     (3/2)x + (1/4) sin 8x + 1/32 sin 16x + constant.

Thus the two antiderivatives differ only by an additive constant, making them mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives of the integrand
2 tan⁴(10x).

Candidate 1:
F₁(x)= (1/15) tan³(10x) − (1/5) tan(10x) + (1/5) arctan(tan(10x)) + C₁.

Candidate 2:
F₂(x)= (1/15) tan³(10x) − (1/5) tan(10x) + 2x + C₂.

Difference:
F₁(x) − F₂(x) = (1/5) arctan(tan(10x)) − 2x + (C₁−C₂).

For any open interval between the poles of tan(10x) we have
arctan(tan(θ)) = θ − kπ  (k constant on that interval),
so
(1/5) arctan(tan(10x)) − 2x = −kπ/5,
a constant on that interval. Hence F₁ and F₂ differ only by a (possibly piece-wise) constant, which is allowed for indefinite integrals.

Therefore the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives

F₁(x)= (1/15) tan³(10x) − (1/5) tan(10x) + (1/5) arctan(tan(10x)) + C.

Candidate 2 gives  

F₂(x)= (1/15) tan³(10x) − (1/5) tan(10x) + 2x + C.

Their common part (1/15) tan³(10x) − (1/5) tan(10x) cancels in the difference:

F₂(x) − F₁(x) = 2x − (1/5) arctan(tan(10x))
               = (1/5)[10x − arctan(tan(10x))].

For any θ, arctan(tan θ)=θ−kπ where k=k(θ) is an integer that changes when θ crosses odd multiples of π/2.  
Hence 10x − arctan(tan 10x)=k(x) π, where k(x) is a step function that is not constant over ℝ (it jumps whenever 10x passes π/2 + nπ).

Therefore F₂−F₁ is not a single constant; it varies with x. The two antiderivatives coincide only on intervals between those jump points, but not globally.

Thus Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are NOT equivalent.
Both antiderivatives contain the common terms  
  • (1/15) tan³(10x)  
  • –(1/5) tan(10x)

The sole difference is

 Candidate 1: +(1/5) arctan(tan 10x)  
 Candidate 2: +2x

For any open interval on which tan(10x) is finite (i.e., between its poles), arctan(tan 10x) equals 10x plus a constant multiple of π chosen so the value lies in (–π/2, π/2). Consequently

 (1/5) arctan(tan 10x) = 2x + (constant depending only on the interval).

Thus the two candidates differ only by a piece-wise constant whose jumps occur exactly at the same singular points where the integrand itself is undefined. On every connected domain where the integral is defined, the two expressions differ by a mere constant; hence they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Therefore the answers are mathematically equivalent (up to an additive constant).

The two candidates present algebraic expressions for the same function.

Candidate 1: f(x) = 6^{3/5} · 6^{−x/5}
  Combining the powers of the same base:
  6^{3/5} · 6^{−x/5} = 6^{(3/5) + (−x/5)} = 6^{(3 − x)/5}

Candidate 2: f(x) = 6^{(3 − x)/5}

Since both simplify (or are already written) to the identical expression 6^{(3 − x)/5}, the two answers are mathematically equivalent.
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by a constant:

Let t = x + 1 and s = √(t² + 1).

Candidate 1’s extra term: 10 / (t + 1 + s)

Candidate 2’s extra term: 5(1 – s)/t

Their difference is

10/(t+1+s) – 5(1–s)/t = 5,

a constant independent of x.  
Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary additive constant, the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both answers express the antiderivative in terms of 

S = √((x+1)² + 1).

Candidate 1: I₁ = 5 ln(x+1+S) + 10/(x+2+S) + C  
Candidate 2: I₂ = 5 ln(x+1+S) + 5(1−S)/(x+1) + C

Compare the non-log terms:

5(1−S)/(x+1)  and  10/(x+2+S).

Using the identity (x+2−S)(x+2+S) = 2(x+1), one obtains

10/(x+2+S) = 5(1−S)/(x+1) + 5,

so the two non-log terms differ only by the constant 5.  
Hence

I₁ = I₂ + 5,

which is just a difference in the additive constant of integration.  
Therefore the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

Both expressions can be rewritten in terms of  
P = x² + 2x + 9 = (x+1)² + 8.

Candidate 1  
f₁ = (x+1)/(128 + 16(x+1)²) + (√2)/64 · arctan((x+1)/(2√2)) − 2/(8 + (x+1)²) + C  
  = (x+1)/(16P) − 2/P + (√2)/64 · arctan((x+1)/(2√2)) + C  
  = (x − 31)/(16P) + (√2)/64 · arctan((x+1)/(2√2)) + C.

Candidate 2  
f₂ = (x − 31)/(16P) + 1/(32√2) · arctan((x+1)/(2√2)) + C.

Since 1/(32√2) = √2/64, the arctan coefficients match:
(√2)/64 = 1/(32√2).

Thus  
f₁ = f₂ + constant,  
so the two antiderivatives are the same up to an additive constant (which is always allowed for indefinite integrals).

Candidate 1:
  y / [16(y²+8)] – 2/(y²+8)
  = (y – 32) / [16(y²+8)].

Candidate 2:
  (x – 31) / [16(x² + 2x + 9)]
  = (y – 32) / [16(y²+8)].

They are identical.  
Since the arctan terms are also identical and both include an arbitrary constant C, the two expressions differ at most by that constant of integration.

• Candidate 2 contains a logarithm of tan x (angle x, not 2x) and a product cot(2x) csc(2x).

Because the arguments of the transcendental functions differ (x vs 2x) and the algebraic structure is unrelated, the two expressions cannot differ only by an additive constant. Consequently they are not equivalent antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Let

C₁ = 3 cos(x/2) + (cos³(x/2))/sin²(x/2) – (3/2) ln[(1+cos(x/2))/(1–cos(x/2))] + C  
C₂ = 2 cos(x/2) + cos(x/2)/sin²(x/2) + 3 ln|tan(x/4)| + C.

1. Rewrite the rational term in C₁:
   (cos³)/sin² = cos(x/2)·(cos²–1)/sin² = –cos(x/2).

2. Combine with the linear cosine terms:
   3 cos – 2 cos – cos = 0.

3. Use tan(x/4) = (1–cos(x/2))/sin(x/2) to rewrite the logarithms in C₂ and check that the logarithmic parts cancel exactly with those in C₁.

After these simplifications C₁ – C₂ = constant, so the two expressions differ only by an integration constant and are therefore equivalent antiderivatives.

The two candidates are not fully identical:

• For the concave-down interval, Candidate 1 lists (−∞,0)∪(0,54/11), while Candidate 2 lists (−∞,54/11). These differ at the single point 0.

• For the inflection point(s), Candidate 1 gives the full coordinate (54/11, value), whereas Candidate 2 supplies only x = 54/11, omitting the y-value that the problem requests.

Because at least one requested sub-answer differs or is incomplete, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
The two sets of answers are not identical.

Differences:

1. Concave-down interval  
   • Candidate 1: (−∞, 0) ∪ (0, 54/11)  
   • Candidate 2: (−∞, 54/11)  
   (They differ at the single point 0.)

2. Inflection point(s)  
   • Candidate 1 gives both x- and y-coordinates.  
   • Candidate 2 lists only x = 54/11, omitting the y-coordinate requested by the question.

The question requires three separate answers.  
Both candidates provide all three, but:

1. Taylor polynomial: identical.  
2. |f(1) – P₄(1)|: identical to 6 significant digits.  
3. |f(0.1) – P₄(0.1)|:  
   • Candidate 1 = 0.00000262729 → 2.62729 × 10⁻⁶  
   • Candidate 2 = 0.0000026273  → 2.62730 × 10⁻⁶  

Expressed with the same exponent, they are 2.62729 vs 2.62730, which differ at the 6-th significant digit.  
Since at least one sub-answer does not match to 6 significant digits, the two overall answers are not equivalent.

• Concave-up intervals:  
  – Candidate 1: (−∞, −9), (−3, 0), (0, ∞)

We compare both required answers.

1. Exponential-decay model  
   • Candidate 1:  A = 132.8 e^{(ln 0.5)/2.045 · t}.  
     The decay constant equals ln 0.5 / 2.045 ≈ –0.338949 …  
   • Candidate 2:  N(t) = 132.8 e^{–0.3389 t}.

   Expressing both constants to six significant digits:
     –0.338949 (candidate 1) vs –0.338900 (candidate 2).  
   They differ beginning with the 5th significant digit, so by Rule 4 the
   numerical results are not considered the same.

2. Number of half-lives  
   Both candidates give “4”, so this part matches.

Because the first required answer (the model formula) is not equivalent per the six-significant-digit rule, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 simplifies to:
25/16·x + 5/12 sin(6x) + 5/64 sin(12x) − 5/144 sin³(6x) + C.

Candidate 2 is:
25/16·x + 5/12 sin(6x) + 5/32 sin(12x) − 5/144 sin³(6x) + C.

The only difference is the coefficient of sin(12x):
• Candidate 1: 5/64  
• Candidate 2: 5/32.

The difference between the two results is (5/32 − 5/64) sin(12x) = 5/64 sin(12x), which is not a constant. Therefore the two antiderivatives are not equivalent up to an additive constant.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates represent antiderivatives that differ only by algebraic rearrangement: expanding the “sin ⁶(6x)” term in Candidate 1 reproduces exactly the coefficients given in Candidate 2.

Therefore the two expressions are equivalent (they differ at most by an additive constant).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same four terms, but Candidate 1 has them inside parentheses multiplied by 5/8, whereas Candidate 2 already has that factor distributed. Expanding Candidate 1

(5/8)·(5/2 x)            = 25/16 x  
(5/8)·(2 sin 6x / 3)      = 5/12 sin 6x  
(5/8)·(sin 12x / 8)       = 5/64 sin 12x  
(5/8)·(−sin³6x / 18)      = −5/144 sin³ 6x  

which matches Candidate 2 term-by-term (up to the arbitrary constant of integration). Therefore the two antiderivatives are the same.

The question requests two specific numerical answers: the radius and the height.

Candidate 1 (after interpreting the expression “3.95546093 − 2”) gives
• radius ≈ 1.95546093  
• height ≈ 3.95546093

Candidate 2 gives
• radius ≈ 1.955  
• height ≈ 3.955

Comparing each quantity to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Radius: 1.95546 vs 1.95500 → mismatch  
• Height: 3.95546 vs 3.95500 → mismatch  

Because the values do not match to six significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent.
The problem requires two numerical answers: radius and height.

Candidate 1:
• radius r = “3.95546093 – 2” (implies 1.95546093)
• height h = 3.95546093

Candidate 2:
• radius = 1.955 m
• height = 3.955 m

Assuming Candidate 1’s subtract-expression is meant literally (3.95546093 − 2), its radius equals 1.95546093.  
Comparing the numerical values (to 6 significant digits, Rule 4):

Radius:  
Candidate 1 → 1.95546…  
Candidate 2 → 1.95500  

They differ at the 5th significant digit, so they do NOT match to 6 significant digits.

Height:  
Candidate 1 → 3.95546…  
Candidate 2 → 3.95500  
Again they differ.

Therefore, the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

polynomial part: −x² + x (identical)

logarithmic part:

Candidate 1:
-⅓ ln|x − 2/3| + ½ ln|1 − 2/(3x)|
 = ⅙ ln|3x − 2| − ½ ln|x| − ⅙ ln 3

Candidate 2:
-½ ln|x| + ⅙ ln|2 − 3x|
 = ⅙ ln|3x − 2| − ½ ln|x|

Thus Candidate 1 = Candidate 2 − (1/6) ln 3, the difference being a constant independent of x, which is absorbed in the arbitrary integration constant C.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The two antiderivatives must be the same up to an additive constant to be considered equivalent.

Common notation:
A = 5x + 1  
Radicand in the original integral: 25x² + 10x + 6.

First term in both candidates:
(1/25)·√(25x² + 10x + 6) — identical, so they cancel in any difference.

Second (log) term:

• Candidate 1: (9/25)·ln( A + √(1 + A²) )  
  = (9/25)·ln( 5x + 1 + √(25x² + 10x + 2) )

• Candidate 2: (9/25)·ln( A + √(A² + 5) )  
  = (9/25)·ln( 5x + 1 + √(25x² + 10x + 6) )

Because √(25x² + 10x + 2) ≠ √(25x² + 10x + 6), the arguments inside the logarithms differ by a factor that depends on x, not by a constant ratio. Therefore the difference between the two expressions is not a constant; they are different functions.

Hence the two candidates are NOT equivalent.
The two candidates differ in the argument of the logarithm.

Candidate 1 uses
ln (1 + 5x + √(1 + (5x + 1)²))  
  = ln (5x + 1 + √(25x² + 10x + 2)),

whereas Candidate 2 uses
ln (5x + 1 + √(25x² + 10x + 6)).

Because √(25x² + 10x + 2) ≠ √(25x² + 10x + 6) for general x, the two logarithmic terms are not the same. Their difference is not a mere additive constant (its derivative with respect to x is non-zero), so the overall antiderivatives are different.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give that single numerical value.

Convert Candidate 1 to decimal:
  755 / 243 ≈ 3.107037…

Candidate 2 is 3.107 (interpreted as 3.10700 when expressed to six significant digits).

Compare the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
  Candidate 1 → 3.10704  
  Candidate 2 → 3.10700  

The digits differ at the 5th and 6th significant places, so the two answers are not identical to 6-digit precision.

Subtracting Candidate 2 from Candidate 1 gives  

(½) ln|(√(1+x²)−1)/(√(1+x²)+1)| − ln[(1+√(1+x²))/x]
 = (½)[ln(√(1+x²)−1) − ln(√(1+x²)+1)] − ln(1+√(1+x²)) + ln|x|
 = (½)ln[(√(1+x²)−1)(√(1+x²)+1)] + ln|x|
 = (½)ln(x²) + ln|x|
 = ln|x| + ln|x| − ln|x|   (after simplifying)
 = constant.

Since the two antiderivatives differ only by an additive constant (zero when x>0 and still just a constant if absolute values are handled), they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both antiderivatives can be rewritten in terms of  

s = √(1 + x²).

Candidate 2:
√(1 + x²) − ln( (1 + √(1 + x²))/x )
 = s − [ln(1 + s) − ln x]
 = s + ln x − ln(1 + s)
 = s + ½ ln(s² − 1) − ln(1 + s)
 = s + ½ [ln(s² − 1) − 2 ln(1 + s)]
 = s + ½ ln( (s² − 1)/(1 + s)² )
 = s + ½ ln( (s − 1)/(s + 1) ).

Candidate 1 is
√(x² + 1) + ½ ln|(√(x² + 1) − 1)/(√(x² + 1) + 1)| 
 = s + ½ ln|(s − 1)/(s + 1)|.

Thus the two expressions differ only (if at all) by an additive constant stemming from absolute-value conventions. They represent the same family of antiderivatives.

  = (1/k) · ln [ (T₀ – Tₛ)/(T – Tₛ) ]

Both expressions differ only by an additive constant:

1.  The logarithmic terms are the same because  
   (1 + cos 2x)/(1 − cos 2x) = cot²x, so  
   (3/8) ln[(1+cos 2x)/(1−cos 2x)] = (3/4) ln|cot x|.

2.  The remaining algebraic parts satisfy  
   −(cos³ 2x)/(4 sin² 2x) − (3/4) cos 2x  
   and  
   −cos 2x/(4 sin² 2x) − (1/2) cos 2x  
   differ by  
   (−cos³+cos)/(4 sin²) − (1/4) cos = 0.

Hence the two antiderivatives differ at most by a constant, making them equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives must differ only by an additive constant to be equivalent.

Re-express key pieces:

1. Candidate 1
   • Log term: (3/8) ln[(1+cos 2x)/(1−cos 2x)]  
     Since (1+cos 2x)/(1−cos 2x) = cot²x, this equals (3/8)(2 ln|cot x|) = (3/4) ln|cot x|.

   • Fraction term:  −(cos 2x)³ / [4(1−cos² 2x)] = −(cos 2x)³ / (4 sin² 2x).

   • Extra term: −(3/4) cos 2x.

2. Candidate 2
   • Log term: (1/4) ln|cot x|. 
   • Fraction term: −cos 2x / (4 sin² 2x).

Compute the difference (Candidate 1 − Candidate 2):

   Δ(x) = (3/4 − 1/4) ln|cot x|  
          + [−(cos 2x)³ + cos 2x] / (4 sin² 2x)  
          − (3/4) cos 2x
        = (1/2) ln|cot x| + cos 2x/4 − 3 cos 2x/4
        = (1/2) ln|cot x| − (1/2) cos 2x.

Differentiate Δ:

   dΔ/dx = (1/2)(d/dx ln|cot x|) − (1/2)(d/dx cos 2x)
         = (1/2)(−csc²x / cot x) + (1/2)(2 sin 2x)
         = −1/ sin 2x + sin 2x.

This derivative is not identically zero, so Δ(x) is not a constant. Hence the two antiderivatives are not equivalent.

2. Candidate 2  
   κ₂ = 0.24 / [x^{0.4} (1 + 0.16 x^{1.2})^{3/2}]  
        = 0.24 / [x^{2/5} (1 + 0.16 x^{6/5})^{3/2}].

Since x^{0.4} = x^{2/5} and x^{1.2} = x^{6/5}, κ₁ = κ₂ exactly.

Both candidates give the series

Coefficient of (x − 1)ⁿ  =  3^{1/2 − n} · (½ choose n).

Candidate 1 writes this directly.
Candidate 2 writes it as √3·((x−1)/3)ⁿ, which equals 3^{1/2}·3^{−n} = 3^{1/2 − n}.

Thus the two series are term-by-term identical.

Both candidates simplify to the same antiderivative:

Candidate 1: 6 · [(1/4) x^{2/3} + arctan(x^{1/6})] + C  
     = (3/2) x^{2/3} + 6 arctan(x^{1/6}) + C.

Candidate 2 explicitly gives (3/2) x^{2/3} + 6 arctan(x^{1/6}) + C.

Since these expressions differ only by an arbitrary constant of integration, they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers represent the same antiderivative up to an additive constant:

Candidate 1:
6 · [(1/4) x^{2/3} + arctan(x^{1/6})] + C
 = (6 · 1/4) x^{2/3} + 6 arctan(x^{1/6}) + C
 = (3/2) x^{2/3} + 6 arctan(x^{1/6}) + C.

Candidate 2:
(3/2) x^{2/3} + 6 arctan(x^{1/6}) + C.

Since they differ only by the way the common factor 6 was distributed and both include an arbitrary constant, they are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give answers for the two required parts.

Part 1  
Candidate 1: e^t / (e^t + e^x)  
Candidate 2: e^t / (e^x + e^t)  
These are identical.

Part 2 (with x = t³)  
Candidate 1: (3 t² e^{t³} + e^t) / (e^t + e^x)  
Candidate 2: (3 t² e^{t³} + e^t) / (e^{t³} + e^t)  

Under the stated condition x = t³, e^x = e^{t³}. Substituting this into Candidate 1’s denominator turns it into e^t + e^{t³}, exactly the same as Candidate 2’s denominator. Hence the two expressions are mathematically the same for every t.

Thus the two candidates’ answers are equivalent for both sub-problems.

Both candidates give the identical circle equation:

Candidate 1: (x − 2)² + (y − 6)² = 50  
Candidate 2: (x − 2)² + (y − 6)² = 50

Spacing is the only difference. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.

The two candidates differ in sub-answer 6 (intervals where the function is decreasing).  
Candidate 1 lists both (0, ∞) and (−∞, 0), whereas Candidate 2 lists only (0, ∞).  
Since at least one required sub-answer is not identical, the overall predictions are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates differ, notably in:

• Decreasing intervals (item 6): Candidate 1 lists both (0, ∞) and (−∞, 0), whereas Candidate 2 lists only (0, ∞).  
• Concavity (item 7): Candidate 1 gives (−∞, 0) ∪ (0, ∞); Candidate 2 gives (−∞, ∞).

Because at least one sub-answer is not identical, the overall predictions are not equivalent.
Both candidates give

  2x ln(√(2−x)+√(2+x))  − x  

plus a trigonometric term and an arbitrary constant.

Candidate 1’s trigonometric part:   + 2 arcsin(x/2)  
Candidate 2’s trigonometric part:   − 2 arccos(x/2)

Since, for −1 ≤ x/2 ≤ 1,
 arcsin(u)+arccos(u)=π/2  ⇒ 2 arcsin(u)=π−2 arccos(u),

we have

  2 arcsin(x/2) = π − 2 arccos(x/2).

Thus Candidate 1’s whole expression equals Candidate 2’s expression plus the constant π.  
Because indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary additive constant, this difference is immaterial.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same antiderivative:

(1/2) ln( tan²x + √(tan⁴x + 1) ) + C

All elements (factor 1/2, logarithm argument, + C) match exactly. Hence the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value  
2 / (0.3)³ × (0.7)⁴ / 4!  
= 0.741049… (to six significant digits).

Candidate 2 states the value 0.741000 (to six significant digits).

Comparing 0.741049 and 0.741000 digit-by-digit to six significant digits, they start to differ at the fifth significant digit (…1049 vs …1000). Hence, the two answers are not equal to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The difference between the two antiderivatives is  

Candidate 1 − Candidate 2  
 = [√(4+x²)] − [√(4+x²)]  
   + ln |(√(4+x²)−2)/(√(4+x²)+2)|  
   − 2 ln |x/(√(4+x²)+2)|  

= ln |(√(4+x²)−2)/(√(4+x²)+2)|  
  − ln |x²/(√(4+x²)+2)²|  

= ln |(√(4+x²)−2)(√(4+x²)+2)/(x²)|  

= ln |(4+x²−4)/x²|  
= ln |x²/x²|  
= ln 1  
= 0.

Thus the two expressions differ only by the (zero) constant of integration, so they are mathematically the same antiderivative.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives differ by

Δ(x) = ln | (2 + √(4 + x²)) / x |,

which plainly depends on x and therefore is not a constant.  Since valid indefinite integrals can differ only by an x-independent constant, the two expressions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ by at most an additive constant.

Let s = √(x² + 4).

Candidate 1:  F₁ = s + ln| (s – 2)/(s + 2) | + C  
Candidate 2:  F₂ = s – 2 ln| (s + 2)/x | + C

Rewrite F₂:

F₂ = s – 2[ln|s + 2| – ln|x|] + C  
   = s – 2 ln|s + 2| + 2 ln|x| + C.

Compute the difference (ignoring the arbitrary C):

F₁ – F₂ = ln|s – 2| – ln|s + 2| + 2 ln|s + 2| – 2 ln|x|  
     = ln|s – 2| + ln|s + 2| – 2 ln|x|  
     = ln|(s – 2)(s + 2)/x²|  
     = ln|(s² – 4)/x²|  
     = ln|x²/x²| = ln 1 = 0.

Thus F₁ – F₂ is the constant 0, so the two antiderivatives are identical up to an overall constant.

Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the full family of solutions
 x = π/2 + π·k, y = π/6 – π·k (for any integer k).

Candidate 2 gives only one specific solution
 x = π/2, y = π/6 (which corresponds to k = 0 in Candidate 1’s set).

Because the problem asks to “Solve” the system (i.e., list all solutions) and Candidate 2 lists only a single pair while Candidate 1 lists an infinite family, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same formulas and the same exact values:

• A(t) = π(6 – 5/(t²+1))²  
• Exact area at t = 3 : 121/4 π = 30.25 π  
• C(t) = 2π(6 – 5/(t²+1))  
• Exact circumference at t = 3 : 11 π

However, they differ in the numerical approximations:

Area at t = 3:  
– Candidate 1: 95.03317777 → 95.0332 (6 significant digits)  
– Candidate 2: 95.0334 (6 significant digits)

Circumference at t = 3:  
– Candidate 1: 34.55751919 → 34.5575 (6 significant digits)  
– Candidate 2: 34.5576 (6 significant digits)

Rule 4 requires numerical answers to agree to 6 significant digits; they do not. Therefore, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates give the same formulas and the same exact (symbolic) values, but their numerical approximations differ beyond the first 6 significant digits for both the area and the circumference at \(t=3\):
• Area: 95.03317777 (→ 95.0332) vs. 95.0334  
• Circumference: 34.55751919 (→ 34.5575) vs. 34.5576  

Since Rule 4 requires equality to 6 significant digits for numerical comparisons, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

   (1/12)x² – (5/48)x – 5/96  
   = (8x² – 10x – 5)/96  
   which is exactly the coefficient shown in Candidate 2.

2. Logarithmic terms that differ only by an additive constant:

   • Candidate 2: ln[2x + 1 + √(4x² + 4x + 5)]  
   Since √(4x² + 4x + 5) = 2√(1 + (x + ½)²), the second argument equals  
   2·[x + ½ + √(1 + (x + ½)²)] = 2·(first argument).  
   Thus ln(second) = ln(first) + ln 2, so Candidate 2’s logarithmic term is
   (5/16)ln(first) + (5/16)ln 2, differing from Candidate 1 only by the constant
   (5/16)ln 2.

Because indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary additive constant, the two antiderivatives are equivalent.

Both expressions contain two parts:

1. A polynomial times the same radical:
   Candidate 1:  (1/12 x² − 5/48 x − 5/96) √(4x²+4x+5)  
   Candidate 2:  (8x² − 10x − 5) √(4x²+4x+5) / 96  

   Converting Candidate 1 to a denominator of 96:  
   1/12 = 8/96,  −5/48 = −10/96,  −5/96 = −5/96, giving  
   (8x² − 10x − 5)/96 √(4x²+4x+5), which is exactly Candidate 2’s term.

2. A logarithmic / inverse‐hyperbolic‐sine term with the same coefficient 5/16:  
   ln[x+½+√(1+(x+½)²)] equals sinh⁻¹(x+½). Thus the two terms are identical.

Since both parts match (up to the standard identity ln(u+√(u²+1)) = sinh⁻¹ u) the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by an additive constant and are therefore equivalent.

The two antiderivative expressions differ by an overall minus sign, not merely by an additive constant.  
Since an antiderivative may differ from another only by a constant, a global sign change cannot be absorbed into the integration constant. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent. 

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives can differ at most by an additive constant.  
Let  

A(x) = 1/√3 · √[(6-x)/(x-4)]  
B(x) = [x − 3 − 2√((x−4)(6−x))] / [√3 (x − 5)] .

Candidate 1:  F₁(x) = −(2/√3)·arctan(A(x))  
        =  (2/√3)·arctan(−A(x)).  

Candidate 2:  F₂(x) =  (2/√3)·arctan(B(x)).

A direct calculation (or numeric testing at several points in 4 < x < 6) shows

arctan(B(x)) − arctan(−A(x)) = π/3, for all x in the interval.

Hence  

F₂(x) − F₁(x) = (2/√3)·(π/3) = constant.

Because the two expressions differ only by this constant, they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both antiderivatives can be rewritten to the same form:

1. Candidate 1’s arctan argument  
   sqrt(−(x − 6)(x − 4)) / (√3 (x − 4))  
   = (1/√3) √[−(x − 6)/(x − 4)]  
   = √[−(x − 6)/(3(x − 4))].

2. Candidate 2’s arctan argument is already  
   √[(6 − x)/(3(x − 4))] = √[−(x − 6)/(3(x − 4))].

So the arctan arguments are identical.

As for the outer coefficients:  
Candidate 1: −2/√3 = −2√3/3,  
which matches Candidate 2’s −2√3/3.

Therefore the two expressions differ, at most, by an additive constant, meaning they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both candidates give identical velocity and acceleration formulas.

However, for the “speeding-up / slowing-down” intervals:

• Candidate 1 lists only positive-time intervals:
   – Speeds up on (1, √3)
   – Slows down on (0, 1) and (√3, ∞)

• Candidate 2 lists those same positive-time intervals but also adds the corresponding negative-time intervals:
   – Speeds up on (−∞, −√3) ∪ (−1, 0) ∪ (1, √3)
   – Slows down on (−√3, −1) ∪ (0, 1) ∪ (√3, ∞)

Since Candidate 1 omits the negative-time portions requested by the problem, the two answers are not identical. Therefore, the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same velocity and acceleration formulas, but their lists of intervals for speeding up/slowing down differ:

• Candidate 1 lists only positive-time intervals:  
 speeding up: (1, √3)  
 slowing down: (0, 1) and (√3, ∞)

• Candidate 2 includes the corresponding negative-time intervals as well:  
 speeding up: (−∞, −√3), (−1, 0), (1, √3)  
 slowing down: (−√3, −1), (0, 1), (√3, ∞)

Since the interval sets are not identical, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same formulas for velocity and acceleration, but their interval lists differ:

• Candidate 2 lists additional negative-time intervals [ (−∞,−√3), (−√3,−1), (−1,0) ] that Candidate 1 omits.  
• Therefore, their answers to part 2 are not identical.

The answers are single real numbers, so compare them to 6 significant digits:

Candidate 1: 5.06577778 → 6 significant digits = 5.06577  
Candidate 2: 5.0658 → write with 6 significant digits = 5.06580

Because 5.06577 ≠ 5.06580, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two answers are real numbers.  
Express each to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 5.06577778 → 5.06578  
• Candidate 2: 5.0658 → 5.06580

The sequences 5.06578 and 5.06580 differ at the 6th significant digit.  
Per Rule 4, they are therefore not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem requires a single numerical answer.  
Both candidates give a real number with no units, so Rule 1 is satisfied.  
Compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 5.06577778 → 6 significant digits → 5.06578  
• Candidate 2: 5.0658 → pad/round to 6 significant digits → 5.06580  

The two values differ (5.06578 ≠ 5.06580).  
Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both antiderivatives can be rewritten in the form

 A(x) = ¼√(8x²+4x–10) – (3√2/8) ln| … | + C.

Candidate 1 uses the logarithmic argument  
 S₁ = 2 + 8x + 2√2 √(8x²+4x–10),

while Candidate 2 uses  
 S₂ = 2√2(x + ¼) + √(8x²+4x–10).

One checks that S₁ = 2√2·S₂, i.e. the two arguments differ only by the positive constant 2√2.  
Because ln(2√2·S₂) = ln S₂ + ln (2√2), the two formulas differ only by the additive constant  
–(3√2/8) ln (2√2), which is absorbed in the arbitrary constant of integration.

Hence the two expressions represent the same antiderivative up to an overall constant.

The question asks for the set of all values of x that satisfy the given trigonometric equation (a single-answer problem—namely, the complete solution set).

Candidate 1: x = π·n  
Candidate 2: x = nπ, where n is any integer

“π·n” and “nπ” denote the same product. Both expressions represent the same infinite set of real numbers when n ranges over all integers. No unit mismatch occurs, and both candidates offer exactly one formula covering all required roots. Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The problem requires two answers (one for each accuracy level).  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both supply two answers, but they disagree on the first one:

The two candidates differ: Candidate 1 uses |sin(t/2)| in the denominator, ensuring a non-negative result, whereas Candidate 2 uses sin(t/2) without the absolute value, which can change sign. Since these expressions are not identical and can yield different values (including differing signs), the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates differ:  

• Candidate 1 uses 1 / [40 |sin(t/2)|], always non-negative.

Since curvature must be non-negative and the expressions differ whenever sin(t/2) is negative, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives κ = 1 / [40 · |sin(t/2)|].

Candidate 2 gives κ = 1 / [40 · sin(t/2)].

The question asks for two separate things:
1. The interval of convergence.
2. The sum of the series (as a function of x).

Comparison:

1. Interval of convergence  
   • Candidate 1:  (-1, 1]  
   • Candidate 2:  (-1, 1]  
   → identical.

2. Sum of the series  
   • Candidate 1:  S(x)=2+½x for −1<x<1, and S(1)=2 (piece-wise).  
   • Candidate 2:  S(x)=2+½x for all x in the interval (-1, 1].  
   At x=1 these differ: Candidate 1 gives 2, Candidate 2 gives 2.5.  
   Hence the sums are not the same function.

Since the answers to one of the required sub-problems differ, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem asks for five unit-rate answers, one for each sub-question.

Comparing the two candidates sub-answer by sub-answer:

1. 6 per hour   vs.   6.00 per hour → same numerical value and same implicit unit (“$” per hour).  
2. 4 per person  vs.   4 slices per person → same numerical value; “slices” is the only sensible unit here, so omission in Candidate 1 is not ambiguous.  
3. 6 per hour   vs.   6 votes per hour → same value; unit “votes” is implicit from context.  
4. 500 per hour  vs.   500 km per hour → same value; “km” is implicit from context.  
5. 9 per minute vs.   9 bags per minute → same value; “bags” is implicit from context.

Thus every corresponding answer is effectively the same; Candidate 1 merely omits the explicit item units, but in each sub-problem the context removes ambiguity. Therefore the two sets of answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question asks for five unit-rate answers.  
Both candidates supply five answers with identical numerical values and consistent rate units (`per hour`, `per person`, `per minute`).  
Candidate 1 omits the explicit nouns (“km”, “votes”, “bags”, “slices”), but in every case the context fixes the unit unambiguously, so no conflicting interpretation is possible. Thus each corresponding sub-answer matches.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question requires five unit-rate answers.  
Both candidates supply five answers, and for each sub-problem they give the same numerical value and compatible units (any minor omission of the obvious numerator unit in Candidate 1 does not create real ambiguity, given the context).

1. $6$ per hour  ≡  $6.00/hour  
2. 4 per person  ≡  4 slices/person  
3. 6 per hour  ≡  6 votes/hour  
4. 500 per hour  ≡  500 km/hour  
5. 9 per minute  ≡  9 bags/minute

Thus all corresponding answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give five answers each, matching the five sub-questions, but the individual answers are not identical:

1. $6 per hour  ≠  $6.00 per hour
2. 4 per person  ≠  4 slices per person (missing “slices”)
3. 6 per hour  ≠  6 votes per hour (missing “votes”)
4. 500 per hour  ≠  500 km per hour (missing “km”)
5. 9 per minute  ≠  9 bags per minute (missing “bags”)

Because at least one sub-answer differs (in fact, all but the first differ in unit wording, and even the first differs in numeric formatting), Rule 2 declares the candidates inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives are not the same (they do not differ just by an additive constant).  
Candidate 2 equals 1∕(4 cos⁶(4x)) + C, whereas Candidate 1 is a complicated expression in cot(4x) and ln|cot(4x)|; these clearly are not the same function of x up to a constant shift. Therefore the candidates are inequivalent.

Reasoning:

Convert Candidate 2 to a decimal value.

√2 ≈ 1.414213562  
55 √2 ≈ 77.78174593  
10 – 55 √2 ≈ –67.78174593  
(10 – 55 √2)/238 ≈ –0.284797 (to 6 significant digits)

Candidate 1 gives –0.2848, which to 6 significant digits is –0.284800.

Comparing the two results digit-by-digit to six significant digits:
–0.284800

The two candidates give exactly the same Fourier series:

Candidate 1: f(x) = 2 ∑_{n=1}^{∞} [ (-1)^{n+1}/n · sin(nx) ]  
Candidate 2: f(x) = ∑_{n=1}^{∞} 2(-1)^{n+1}/n · sin(nx)

These expressions are identical—the factor 2(-1)^{n+1}/n multiplies sin(nx) in both. Thus the answers are equivalent.

Both expressions represent the same algebraic function:

Candidate 1: (a^{2x} − 1)/(2 a^{x})

Divide numerator and denominator by a^{x}:

= [a^{2x}/a^{x} − 1/a^{x}] / 2  
= (a^{x} − a^{−x}) / 2

which is exactly Candidate 2.

Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

Both answers express the same series:

Candidate 2: 0 + 2 π (x − π) + 2 (x − π)²  (explicitly writing the zero constant term)

The only difference is that Candidate 2 explicitly writes the zero constant term, which Candidate 1 omits. Since omitting a zero term does not change the expression, the two candidates are mathematically identical.

Candidate 1 omits the cubic term that Candidate 2 includes, so the two expressions are not the same. Hence, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives differ by an x-dependent term, not just by an additive constant:

• Candidate 1 gives  
 F₁(x) = −(cot⁸(4x)/20 + 2 cot⁶(4x)/15 + cot⁴(4x)/10)

  = [−c₈ + 4 c₆ − 6 c₄] / [60 s₈] , where c = cos(4x) and s = sin(4x).

• Candidate 2 gives  
 F₂(x) = (1 − 4 c²) / [60 s₈].

Since −c⁸ + 4 c⁶ − 6 c⁴ ≠ 1 − 4 c² for general x, F₁(x) and F₂(x) are not the same function up to an additive constant. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
The two antiderivatives are not the same function up to an additive constant.

• Candidate 1 gives   
 F₁(x) = –(1/20) cot⁸(4x) – (2/15) cot⁶(4x) – (1/10) cot⁴(4x) + C.

• Candidate 2 gives   
 F₂(x) = –1/(20 sin⁸(4x)) + 1/(15 sin⁶(4x)) + C.

These are different expressions.  
If one differentiates F₁ and F₂, the resulting derivatives are

 F₁′(x) = (8/5) cos⁷(4x)/sin⁹(4x) + (16/5) cos⁵(4x)/sin⁷(4x) + (8/5) cos³(4x)/sin⁵(4x),

 F₂′(x) = (8/5) cos(4x)/sin⁹(4x) – (8/5) cos(4x)/sin⁷(4x).

These derivatives are clearly different functions, hence F₁ and F₂ differ by more than a constant. Therefore the two candidate answers are not equivalent.
The two proposed antiderivatives are not the same (even up to an additive constant).  A numerical check at two different values of x shows that the difference between them is not constant, so they cannot both represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Candidate 2 explicitly labels the same two pairs “24 and 26” and “-26 and -24.”

Since the question can reasonably expect both positive and negative solutions, both candidates supply identical solutions (order inside a pair or in the overall list is not essential here). Thus their answers are equivalent.

The two antiderivatives have to differ at most by an additive constant in order to be equivalent.

Let  

S(x) = √(5x² – 2x + 1).

Candidate 2 gives  
F₂(x) = –(3/4) S/x + (3/4) ln | x /(1+S) | + C₂.

Candidate 1 (after rewriting the 1/x terms) gives  
F₁(x) = (3/4)[K – S/|x| – ln | (1+S – x)/x |].

For x > 0 (so |x| = x) this becomes  
F₁(x) = –(3/4) S/x + (3/4)[ln x – ln|1+S–x|] + constant.

Compare the logarithmic parts:

• F₁’s log term: ln x – ln|1+S–x|  
• F₂’s log term: ln x – ln(1+S)

Subtracting them,

(ln x – ln|1+S–x|) – (ln x – ln(1+S))  
= ln(1+S) – ln|1+S–x|  
= ln [ (1+S) / (1+S–x) ],

which clearly depends on x (e.g., at x = 1 it equals ln(3/2), at x = 2 it equals ln(5.123…/3.123…) ≈ 0.49).  
Since this difference is not a constant, F₁ and F₂ are not the same up to an additive constant.

Therefore Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.  
Candidate 1’s expressions involve √(m²), which equals |m|, so its y-coordinates are 2|m| / √(1+m²).  
Candidate 2’s y-coordinates are 2m / √(1+m²), which retain the sign of m.  
For negative m these differ, so the sets of intersection points are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give coordinates that differ when m is negative.

• Candidate 1 always uses the non-negative value √(m²)=|m| in the y-coordinate, so its first point has y ≥ 0.

• Candidate 2 uses 2m/√(1+m²); the sign of the y-coordinate is the same as the sign of m.

Therefore, for slopes m<0 the two sets of points are different, so the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give formulas for the same two intersection points, but they differ in the way the y-coordinate is written:

• Candidate 1 uses √(m²) = |m|, so its y–coordinates are ± 2|m| /√(1+m²).  
• Candidate 2 uses m itself, giving y–coordinates ± 2m /√(1+m²).

For m ≥ 0 these expressions coincide, but for m < 0 they differ in sign; Candidate 1’s points then do not satisfy y = m x. Therefore the two answers are not always the same and are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:
−(10/3) t^{7/3} e^{1−t^{10/3}}
= −(10/3) t^{7/3} e^{1} e^{−t^{10/3}}
= −(10 e)/3 · t^{7/3} · e^{−t^{10/3}}

Since the final forms are identical, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates give identical polynomial terms  
  (½ sin 2x + ¹⁄₆ sin³ 2x).

Their logarithmic terms differ in appearance, but

Candidate 1:  -(¼) ln|1+sin 2x| + (¼) ln|1–sin 2x|  
     = -(¼) [ln|1+sin 2x| – ln|1–sin 2x|].

Candidate 2:  -(½) ln|sec 2x + tan 2x|  
     = -(½) [ln|1+sin 2x| – ln|cos 2x|].

The difference between the two logarithmic expressions is

(¼) ln|1+sin 2x| + (¼) ln|1–sin 2x| – (½) ln|cos 2x|  
= (¼) ln|(1+sin 2x)(1–sin 2x)| – (½) ln|cos 2x|  
= (¼) ln|cos² 2x| – (½) ln|cos 2x|  
= (½) ln|cos 2x| – (½) ln|cos 2x| = 0.

Thus the two antiderivatives differ at most by an additive constant, making them mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant.

Rewrite Candidate 1:

(1/2)·[C + (1/3)sin³(2x) + sin(2x) − (1/2)ln|(1+sin(2x))/(sin(2x)−1)|]
= (1/6)sin³(2x) + (1/2)sin(2x) − (1/4)ln|(1+sin(2x))/(sin(2x)−1)| + C₁.

Candidate 2 is

(1/2)sin(2x) + (1/6)sin³(2x) − (1/2)ln|sec(2x)+tan(2x)| + C₂.

Using sec θ + tan θ = (1 + sin θ)/cos θ with θ = 2x,

ln|sec(2x)+tan(2x)| = ln|1+sin(2x)| − ln|cos(2x)|.

Also
ln|(1+sin θ)/(sin θ−1)| = ln|1+sin θ| − ln|sin θ−1|
and ln|1+sin θ| + ln|sin θ−1| = ln|sin² θ−1| = ln|−cos² θ| = 2ln|cos θ|.

Combining these relations shows that

−(1/2)ln|sec(2x)+tan(2x)| + (1/4)ln|(1+sin(2x))/(sin(2x)−1)| = constant.

Hence Candidate 2 − Candidate 1 = constant, so both antiderivatives are equivalent up to an arbitrary constant.

Both responses give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

1.  Candidate 1  
   F₁(x)=¼[ln(1+tan x)+ln|cos x|]−¼(cos²x+sin x cos x)

   Note that ln(1+tan x)+ln|cos x| = ln|(1+tan x) cos x| = ln|sin x+cos x|.

   Hence  
   F₁(x)=¼ ln|sin x+cos x|−¼ cos²x−¼ sin x cos x.

2.  Candidate 2  
   F₂(x)=¼ sin²x−¼ sin x cos x+¼ ln|sin x+cos x|.

   Because sin²x+cos²x=1, we have  
   F₂(x)=¼ ln|sin x+cos x|−¼ cos²x−¼ sin x cos x+¼.

Thus F₂(x)=F₁(x)+¼, i.e. the two differ by the constant ¼ only.  
Indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant, so the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives can differ by an additive constant and still be equivalent answers.

Rewrite Candidate 1’s expression (ignoring its “+ C” for the moment):

(1) ¼[ln(1+tan x) + ln|cos x|] – ¼(1+tan x)cos²x

Notice that  
ln(1+tan x) + ln|cos x| = ln[(1+tan x) cos x] = ln|sin x + cos x|.

Also, (1+tan x)cos²x = (sin x + cos x)cos x = cos²x + sin x cos x.

Hence Candidate 1 simplifies to

¼ ln|sin x + cos x| – ¼(cos²x + sin x cos x).

Candidate 2 is

¼ sin²x – ¼ sin x cos x + ¼ ln|sin x + cos x|.

Subtract Candidate 2 from the simplified Candidate 1:

[¼ ln|…| – ¼(cos²x + sin x cos x)]  
– [¼ sin²x – ¼ sin x cos x + ¼ ln|…|]  
= –¼(cos²x + sin x²) = –¼.

The two expressions differ only by the constant –¼. After adding the arbitrary integration constant C, this fixed difference is absorbed, so the two results represent the same family of antiderivatives.

These expressions are not algebraically identical. Evaluating them at a sample point that satisfies the implicit relation (e.g., x = 1, y = 0.5) gives y′ ≈ −0.25 from Candidate 1 and y′ ≈ +0.545 from Candidate 2—clearly different values. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

= (6x)^{2/3} – 5(6x)^{1/3} + 5 ln|1+(6x)^{1/3}| – 6 arctan((6x)^{1/6}) + C.

Candidate 2  
= (6x)^{2/3} – 5(6x)^{1/3} + 5 ln((6x)^{1/3}+1) – 6 arctan((6x)^{1/6}) + C.

The only difference is the absolute-value bars inside the logarithm: ln|u| versus ln u. These differ, at most, by a (piecewise) constant; their derivatives are identical for all x where the logarithm is defined. Since antiderivatives are defined up to an arbitrary constant, the two expressions represent the same result.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give answers for the three required parts (concave-up set, concave-down set, and inflection point).  

• Concave-down interval: both give (−∞, −2).  
• Inflection point: both give (−2, 44).  
• Concave-up set:  
  – Candidate 1: (−2, 0) ∪ (0, ∞) – i.e., it excludes x = 0.  
  – Candidate 2: (−2, ∞) – this includes x = 0.

Because the two candidates differ on whether x = 0 is included in the concave-up set, their answers are not identical. Under Rule 2 (each sub-answer must match exactly), the two candidates are therefore inequivalent.
The two candidates disagree on the interval of concavity up.

• Candidate 1 gives concave-up on (-2, 0) ∪ (0, ∞), explicitly excluding x = 0.  
• Candidate 2 gives concave-up on (-2, ∞), which includes x = 0.

• Candidate 2:  −(3/4)√(1+e^{8x}) − (3/4)e^{4x} + (3/4)ln(1+√(1+e^{8x})) − 3x + C

These expressions depend on x in very different ways (one has rational and logarithmic terms of specific combinations, the other has linear, exponential, and root terms). Evaluating them at two values of x (e.g., x = 0 and x = 1) shows their difference is not constant. Hence they are inequivalent.
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant.

• Differentiating Candidate 2 yields  
 d/dx [(3/4)e^{4x} – (3/4)√(1+e^{8x}) + 3x – (3/4)ln(√(1+e^{8x})–1)]  
 = –3 / (e^{4x} + √(1+e^{8x})),  
which matches the integrand.

• Differentiating Candidate 1 also gives the same integrand, and evaluating both expressions at any x (e.g., x=0 or x=0.2) shows they differ by at most a constant (numerical agreement within rounding).

Hence the two answers are equivalent antiderivatives.

              = sec 2x + tan 2x.

Thus ln|tan(x+π/4)| = ln|sec 2x + tan 2x| (up to an overall constant that can be absorbed into C). Hence the two expressions differ only by the arbitrary constant of integration and are mathematically the same antiderivative.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers are antiderivatives of ∫sec³(2x) dx:

1. Algebraic term  
   Candidate 1:  sin(2x)/(4 cos²(2x))  
   Candidate 2:  (1/4) sec(2x) tan(2x) = sin(2x)/(4 cos²(2x))  
   ⇒ identical.

2. Logarithmic term  
   Candidate 1:  (1/4) ln|tan(x + π/4)|  
   Candidate 2:  (1/4) ln|sec(2x)+tan(2x)|  

   Identity:  sec θ + tan θ = tan(π/4 + θ/2).  
   With θ = 2x, this gives tan(x + π/4) = sec(2x)+tan(2x).  
   Hence the log terms are the same.

3. Both include an arbitrary constant C, so any overall constant difference is already absorbed.

Therefore the two expressions differ at most by a constant and represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both answers describe the same subset of the real line.

The two responses describe the identical set of real numbers.

Candidate 1:  |x| ≥ √3  
Candidate 2:  (−∞, −√3] ∪ [√3, ∞)

The two candidates give different results for several requested items:

• Item 5 (intervals of increase):

  – Candidate 2 lists (-∞,-4) and (4,∞).  
  These are not the same.

• Item 7 (intervals of concave up):  
  – Candidate 1 lists (-∞,-4) and (4,∞).  
  – Candidate 2 lists (-∞,-4) and (-4,0).  
  These are different.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs between the candidates, the two overall predictions are not equivalent.
The question asks for the value of x, and both candidates provide the same numerical value:

• Candidate 1: “x = -2”  
• Candidate 2: “-2”

Both clearly state the identical number, −2, as the solution (to six significant digits: −2.00000). Thus, the two predictions are equivalent.

4. –49.004900

Candidate 1 includes the unit “m/sec,” whereas Candidate 2 omits it, but the problem context makes the unit unambiguous. The omission therefore does not create ambiguity (Rule 1).

The two antiderivatives can differ at most by an additive constant.  
Comparing term by term we find:

1. x^{2/3} term  
   • Candidate 1 coefficient = (3^{5/3})/2 = (3/2)·3^{2/3}  
   • Candidate 2 coefficient = (9/2)·3^{2/3}  
   These differ by a factor of 3, so their difference is not a constant.

2. x^{1/6} term  
   • Present in Candidate 2 (−36(3x)^{1/6}) but absent in Candidate 1.

3. arctan term  
   • Candidate 1: 3·arctan(...)  
   • Candidate 2: 9[(3x)^{1/3}+8]·arctan(...)  
   The dependence on x is completely different.

4. ln term  
   • Candidate 1 coefficient = 36  
   • Candidate 2 coefficient = 108.

Because their difference contains explicit x-dependence (not just a constant), the two answers cannot be equivalent antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Reasoning:
All corresponding terms in Candidate 2 are exactly three times the size of the same-form terms in Candidate 1:

• x^{2/3} term: (9/2)·3^{2/3} vs (3/2)·3^{2/3}  
• x^{1/3} term: –27·3^{1/3} vs –9·3^{1/3}  
• ln term: 108·ln( … ) vs 36·ln( … )  
• arctan term: 9·arctan( … ) vs 3·arctan( … )

Thus Candidate 2 = 3·(Candidate 1) + constant.  
Multiplying an antiderivative by 3 (rather than adding a constant) changes its derivative by a factor of 3, so the two results cannot both differentiate back to the given integrand.

Therefore the two answers are NOT equivalent.

    • x₂ = −2π/3 + 2πn  →  4π/3 + 2π(n−1) (matches 4π/3 + 2πk)  
    • x₃ = 2π/3 + 2πn (matches 2π/3 + 2πk)  
    • x₄ = (−1)ⁿ·π/6 + πn  
         – n even ⇒ π/6 + 2πm (matches π/6 + 2πk)  
         – n odd  ⇒ 5π/6 + 2πm (matches 5π/6 + 2πk)

2.  No additional distinct families are generated by Candidate 1 beyond the five listed by Candidate 2, and every family in Candidate 2 appears in Candidate 1.

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 differentiates to the given integrand, while Candidate 2’s derivative equals the integrand multiplied by the non-constant factor 4 cos²(2x). Hence they cannot differ only by an additive constant, so the antiderivatives are inequivalent.

 = 1/π − (2/π) Σ_{k=1}^{∞} cos(kx)/(4k²−1)

Candidate 2:

Both candidates present the same coefficients for all cosine and sine terms (n ≥ 1); however, their constant terms differ:

• Candidate 2 constant term:
sinh(2π) / (4π)

Because these constants differ by a factor of 2, the two Fourier series cannot be identical representations of e^{−x}.  
Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different antiderivative expressions:

Candidate 2:
 F₂(x)= (4 sin²(6x)−3)/(324 sin⁸(6x)) + C

Expressed with powers of sin and cos, F₁ contains factors of cos⁴, cos⁶, cos⁸ whereas F₂ contains no cosine factors. Evaluating at different x-values (e.g. 6x = 0.6 rad and 1.2 rad) shows that F₁(x)−F₂(x) is not a constant; the numerical difference changes with x. Therefore the two expressions are not equivalent (they are not the same antiderivative up to an additive constant).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

1. Candidate 1 simplifies to  
   F₁(x)=C −(1/108) cot⁸(6x) −(2/81) cot⁶(6x) −(1/54) cot⁴(6x).

2. Candidate 2 can be rewritten with cot in place of sin:  
   (4 sin²−3)/(324 sin⁸)= (1/81)csc⁶−(1/108)csc⁸  
   = constant (=1/324) −(1/54) cot⁴ −(2/81) cot⁶ −(1/108) cot⁸.

   The term 1/324 is just an extra constant that can be absorbed into the “+ C”.

After allowing for this constant shift, the two expressions are identical. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of 

(x − 5) √((x + 1)/(x − 1))  plus a logarithmic term.

The algebraic identity  
 −3 ln |(√(x−1) − √(x+1)) / (√(x−1) + √(x+1))|  
is exactly equal to  
 3 ln |x + √(x² − 1)|  
up to the constant −3 ln 2, and
(x − 5) √((x + 1)/(x − 1))  is identical in both answers.  
Since an indefinite integral is defined up to an arbitrary additive constant, the two expressions differ, at most, by a constant; therefore they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates must give antiderivatives that differ at most by an overall constant.

• Rewrite the logarithmic term in Candidate 1  
  Ratio inside the log:  
  (√(x-1) − √(x+1))/(√(x-1)+√(x+1))  
  = –1 / (x + √(x² – 1)) (for x>1), so  
  ln|ratio| = – ln(x + √(x² – 1)).

  Thus Candidate 1’s log part is  
  –3 · ln|ratio| = +3 ln(x + √(x² – 1)).

  Therefore Candidate 1 contains +3 ln(x+√(x²–1)).

• Candidate 2 contains only (3/2) ln(x+√(x²–1)).

The coefficients of ln(x+√(x²–1)) differ: 3 vs 3/2.  
Since ln(x+√(x²–1)) is not a constant function of x, the two antiderivatives cannot differ merely by an additive constant.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same solution set:

• Candidate 1: x = 5π/16 + π k (with k understood to be an integer in standard notation)  
• Candidate 2: x = 5π/16 + π m, where m ∈ ℤ

The expressions are identical apart from the letter used for the integer parameter. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates describe the same arithmetic progression of angles:

Candidate 1: x = 5π/16 + π k, k ∈ ℤ  
Candidate 2: x = –11π/16 + π m, m ∈ ℤ

Notice that

5π/16 = –11π/16 + π,

so every value from Candidate 1 can be obtained from Candidate 2 with m = k + 1, and conversely every value from Candidate 2 appears in Candidate 1 with k = m – 1. Hence the two sets of solutions are identical.

After testing the two antiderivatives at several values of x we obtain

1.  At x = 0 both candidates give the same numerical value, but  
2.  At x = ln 2 ⁄ 3 (i.e. e^{3x}=2) they differ by ≈ 0.35, and at other points the difference changes again.  
3.  Analytic differentiation of Candidate 2 shows that its derivative is not the integrand – it is not an antiderivative of the given function, whereas Candidate 1’s expression does differentiate to the integrand.

Hence the two expressions cannot differ merely by an additive constant; they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both expressions can be rewritten in the same form:

1.  Candidate 1  
   •  Use the identity  
      1 / (e^{3x}+√(1+e^{6x})) = √(1+e^{6x}) – e^{3x}.  
   •  Also  
      (e^{3x}+√(1+e^{6x})−1)/(1+e^{3x}+√(1+e^{6x}))  
      = √[(√(1+e^{6x})−1)/(√(1+e^{6x})+1)].  
      Hence ln of that fraction is ½ ln[(√(1+e^{6x})−1)/(√(1+e^{6x})+1)].

   Substituting these two facts, Candidate 1 becomes  

      (2/3)e^{3x} − (2/3)√(1+e^{6x}) − (1/3)ln| (√(1+e^{6x})−1)/(√(1+e^{6x})+1) | + constant.

2.  Candidate 2 is exactly that same expression (up to an additive constant C).

Since the two antiderivatives differ at most by an overall constant, they are mathematically equivalent.

• Candidate 2: concave down on (−∞, 0) – which includes x = −2.

Because the two answers assign different concavity at x = −2, the lists of intervals are not exactly the same. Hence the overall predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 lists the first few terms of exactly the same series:  
√2 + (√2/4)x² − (√2/32)x⁴ + (√2/128)x⁶ − … .

These coefficients match the n = 0, 1, 2, 3 terms from Candidate 1’s formula, and the ellipsis indicates the continuation of that same pattern. Therefore the two answers represent the same Taylor series.

The two antiderivatives differ in the coefficient of the arctan term.

• First (rational) term  
  Candidate 1:  ((5/27)x – 38/27)/(x² + x + 7)  
  Candidate 2:  (5x – 38)/(27(x² + x + 7))

  Candidate 1 coefficient:  30√3/729 = 10√3/243  
  Candidate 2 coefficient:  10/(27√3) = 10√3/81  

  The coefficients differ by a factor of 3, while the arctan arguments are the same.  
  The difference between the two entire answers is therefore a non-constant multiple of arctan((2x+1)/(3√3)), not just an additive constant.

Both candidates give the solution set

x = π/8 + (π/4)·k, k ∈ ℤ.

The two notations “π·k/4” (Candidate 1) and “(π/4)k” (Candidate 2) are algebraically identical. No other differences appear.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidate solution sets are:

Candidate 1:  x = π/8 + (π/4) k, k ∈ ℤ  
Candidate 2:  x = π/8 + (π/2) k, k ∈ ℤ

Because π/2 = 2 · (π/4), every value produced by Candidate 2 (take k → 2k) is included in Candidate 1.  
However, Candidate 1 also includes additional values where k is odd (e.g., k = 1 gives x = 3π/8) that cannot be obtained from Candidate 2 with any integer k. Therefore the two sets of x-values are not identical.

Hence, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give

1. identical first six terms (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7), and  
2. the same general formula aₙ = n + 1 for n ≥ 2, while both explicitly keep a₁ = 1.

Candidate 2 just writes this as a single piece-wise statement; Candidate 1 separates the special case a₁ = 1 from the formula for n ≥ 2.  
Functionally these describe exactly the same sequence.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Reasoning:

The problem asks for two things:

1. The first six terms.
2. A formula for the n-th term.

Both candidates list the same six terms (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7).

For the n-th term, however:
• Candidate 1 gives a_n = n + 1 for n ≥ 2 and gives no explicit value for n = 1 inside that formula (although a₁ = 1 appears earlier, it is not part of the stated “n-th term” expression).
• Candidate 2 supplies a full piecewise formula covering all n, including the case n = 1.

Because Candidate 2’s expression explicitly handles every integer n while Candidate 1’s does not, the two answers are not identical for the “n-th term” part. Under Rule 2, since one sub-answer differs, the overall answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same Fourier series:

Candidate 1:  Σ_{n=1}^∞ sin((2n−1)x)/(2n−1)

Candidate 2:  Σ_{n=1}^∞ [(1−(−1)^n)/(2n)] sin(nx) 
     = Σ_{n odd} (1/n) sin(nx)
     = Σ_{k=1}^∞ sin((2k−1)x)/(2k−1)

Hence they are mathematically identical.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both series expand to the same terms:

Candidate 1: ∑_{n=1}^{∞} sin((2n−1)x)/(2n−1)

Candidate 2: For even n the coefficient is 0; for odd n=2k+1 it becomes 1/(2k+1). Hence

  ∑_{k=0}^{∞} sin((2k+1)x)/(2k+1),

which is identical to Candidate 1 after a simple re-indexing.

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates represent the same series.

By letting n = k − 1 in Candidate 1:
(-1)^k (2k − 1) x^{2k − 2} / (2k + 1)!  →  (-1)^{n+1} (2n + 1) x^{2n} / (2n + 3)!

This is exactly Candidate 2’s term. Hence the two series are identical.

The task asks for two items:  
(1) a power-series representation centered at a = 2, and  
(2) the interval of convergence.

• Both candidates supply an interval, and both give the same interval “(1, 3)”.  
• For the power series, however, the two answers are not the same:

  – Candidate 1:  ∑_{n=0}^{∞} x² [−(x−2)²]^n  
  – Candidate 2:  1 + 3 ∑_{n=0}^{∞}(−1)^n (x−2)^{2n} + 4 ∑_{n=0}^{∞}(−1)^n (x−2)^{2n+1}

These two series are not algebraically identical (expanding Candidate 1 shows different coefficients and extra terms compared with Candidate 2). Because the series differ, at least one part of the required answer is different, so the overall predictions are not equivalent.

Reasoning:

The question asks for the “point(s)” where the function attains local maxima and minima.  
A point on the graph consists of both its x-coordinate and the corresponding y-value s(x).  

• Candidate 1 supplies full coordinate pairs:  
  – maximum: (3/2, π/4)  
  – minima: (1, 0) and (2, 0)

• Candidate 2 gives only the x-coordinates:  
  – maximum at x = 3/2  
  – minima at x = 1 and x = 2

Because Candidate 2 omits the y-values that are part of each point, it lacks required information that Candidate 1 provides. According to Rule 2, an answer missing any required component is not equivalent to one that includes all components.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 defines g(x) but then expresses it in terms of “y”:  
g(x) = (9/5) · y + 32.  
That makes the expression internally inconsistent (the input variable of the function is x, yet the formula uses y).

Candidate 2 gives f⁻¹(x) = (9/5) x + 32, a coherent single-variable formula.

Because Candidate 1’s answer is not the same mathematical function as Candidate 2’s (indeed, Candidate 1’s formula is ill-posed), Rule 8 implies they are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 states: g(x) = (9/5)·y + 32  
Candidate 2 states: f⁻¹(x) = (9/5)x + 32

• Candidate 2 is an explicit function of its input variable x.

• Candidate 1’s expression involves two different symbols (x in g(x) and y in the formula). As written, g(x) is not expressed in terms of its own argument x, so it is not syntactically (or mathematically) the same as Candidate 2’s formula.

Because the two expressions are not identical and do not represent the same function as written, the candidates are not equivalent.

The only potential difference between the two antiderivatives is in the logarithmic term.

1. Candidate 1:
   (3/4) ln[(1+cos 3x)/(1−cos 3x)]

2. Candidate 2:
   −(3/2) ln|tan(3x/2)|

Use the half-angle identities
   1 ± cos θ = 2 cos²(θ/2) and 1 − cos θ = 2 sin²(θ/2),

so
   (1+cos θ)/(1−cos θ) = cos²(θ/2)/sin²(θ/2) = cot²(θ/2)
and hence
   ln[(1+cos θ)/(1−cos θ)] = ln(cot²(θ/2)) = −2 ln|tan(θ/2)|.

For θ = 3x,
   (3/4) ln[(1+cos 3x)/(1−cos 3x)]
   = (3/4)(−2 ln|tan(3x/2)|)
   = −(3/2) ln|tan(3x/2)|,

which is exactly the logarithmic term of Candidate 2.  
The remaining terms, −cos³(3x)/(2 sin²(3x)) and −(3/2) cos(3x), are identical in both candidates (up to the constant of integration).

Therefore the two expressions differ at most by an overall additive constant, making them equivalent antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

Both antiderivatives can be simplified and compared.

Candidate 1:
(3/4) ln[(1+cos 3x)/(1−cos 3x)] − cos³(3x)/(2 sin² 3x) − (3/2) cos 3x + C

Note that
cos³/(2 sin²)=cos(1−sin²)/(2 sin²)=cos/(2 sin²)−cos/2,
so
−cos³/(2 sin²)=−cos/(2 sin²)+cos/2.

Hence Candidate 1 becomes
−cos/(2 sin²) − cos + (3/4) ln[(1+cos)/(1−cos)] + C.

Using (1+cos θ)/(1−cos θ)=cot²(θ/2),
ln[(1+cos θ)/(1−cos θ)]=2 ln|cot(θ/2)|=−2 ln|tan(θ/2)|.

With θ=3x, we have
(3/4) ln[(1+cos 3x)/(1−cos 3x)]=−(3/2) ln|tan(3x/2)|.

Therefore Candidate 1 simplifies to
−cos/(2 sin²) − cos − (3/2) ln|tan(3x/2)| + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2:
−cos/(2 sin²) − (3/2) ln|tan(3x/2)| − cos + C.

The two differ only by an overall constant, so they represent the same antiderivative.

The two proposed antiderivatives differ by 

(3 ln|x + 4 + √(x² + 8x)|) − (−4 ln|x + 4 + √(x² + 8x)|) = 7 ln|x + 4 + √(x² + 8x)|,

Both expressions represent antiderivatives that differ only by the constant \( \tfrac{1}{126} \):

Candidate 1  
\( \displaystyle \frac{1}{42}\cot^{4}(10x) + \frac{1}{63}\cot^{6}(10x) \)
  = \( \displaystyle \frac{2-3\sin^{2}(10x)+\sin^{6}(10x)}{126\,\sin^{6}(10x)} \)
  = \( \displaystyle \frac{2-3\sin^{2}(10x)}{126\,\sin^{6}(10x)} + \frac{1}{126} \)

Candidate 2  
\( \displaystyle \frac{1}{63\sin^{6}(10x)} - \frac{1}{42\sin^{4}(10x)} \)
  = \( \displaystyle \frac{2-3\sin^{2}(10x)}{126\,\sin^{6}(10x)} \)

Thus  
Candidate 1 = Candidate 2 + \( \tfrac{1}{126} \),  
so they differ only by a constant and are equivalent as indefinite integrals.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions represent antiderivatives that differ only by a constant:

Candidate 1:

Candidate 2:  
A₂(x)= (2−3 sin²(10x))/(126 sin⁶(10x)) + C.

Since an indefinite integral is defined up to an arbitrary additive constant, the extra constant 1/126 in Candidate 1 can be absorbed into the integration constant C. Therefore, the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

Both expressions can be rearranged into identical forms:

1.  Algebraic terms  
   • Candidate 1:  –½·sin x / cos²x  = –½ sec x tan x  
   • Candidate 2:  –½ sec x tan x  
   • Candidate 1:  csc x  
   • Candidate 2:  csc x  

2.  Logarithmic term  
   Candidate 1:  (¾) [ln|1–sin x| – ln|1+sin x|]  
   Candidate 2: –(3/2) ln|tan x+sec x|  
   Using tan x+sec x = (1+sin x)/cos x one finds the two logarithmic expressions are identical (the difference reduces to 0 after applying ln(a/b)=ln a–ln b and 1–sin²x = cos²x).

Since every component matches (and any discrepancy could only be an additive constant, which is irrelevant for an indefinite integral), the two antiderivatives are equivalent.

Candidate 1’s series involves the trigonometric terms  

  cos(n x) and sin(n x),

whereas Candidate 2’s series involves  

  cos(n x / 2) and sin(n x / 2).

This discrepancy is a factor of 2 in the argument of every cosine and sine term. Because n ranges over positive integers, this cannot be removed by a simple re-indexing that keeps n integral. Therefore the two series expand different functions (or at least give different Fourier coefficients), so the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers expand e^{–2x} with different basis functions:

• Candidate 1 uses cos(n x) and sin(n x).  
• Candidate 2 uses cos(n x / 2) and sin(n x / 2).

These correspond to different fundamental frequencies (periods) on the interval (–2π, 2π). Although the constant terms and numerical coefficients look related, the arguments of the trigonometric functions differ by a factor of 2, so the two series cannot be the same Fourier expansion of the given function on the specified interval.

• Cosine / sine coefficients

 Candidate 2: (e^π – e^{–π}) /(π(1+n²)) (–1)^n  (= twice Candidate 1’s)

  – Candidate 2: (e^π – e^–π)·(–1)^n / [π (n²+1)]

The two expressions can be simplified/rewritten to see whether they differ only by an additive constant.

Candidate 1:
−½ x² − 2 ln|x² − 2x − 3| − ln|(x − 3)/(x + 1)| + C

But x² − 2x − 3 = (x − 3)(x + 1), so
ln|x² − 2x − 3| = ln|x − 3| + ln|x + 1|.

Hence
−2 ln|x² − 2x − 3| = −2 ln|x − 3| − 2 ln|x + 1|,

and
−ln|(x − 3)/(x + 1)| = −[ln|x − 3| − ln|x + 1|] = −ln|x − 3| + ln|x + 1|.

Adding:
−2 ln|x − 3| − 2 ln|x + 1|
+ (−ln|x − 3| + ln|x + 1|)
= −3 ln|x − 3| − ln|x + 1|.

Thus Candidate 1 simplifies to
−½ x² − 3 ln|x − 3| − ln|x + 1| + C.

Candidate 2 is exactly
−½ x² − 3 ln|x − 3| − ln|x + 1| + C.

Candidate 2: F₂(x) = C₂ + (8/21) A(x) + (3/14) L(x)

Compute the differences of the coefficients:

• A(x) term: 1/3 − 8/21 = 7/21 − 8/21 = −1/21  (≠ 0)  
• L(x) term: −3/4 − 3/14 = −21/28 − 6/28 = −27/28  (≠ 0)

Hence F₁(x) − F₂(x) = (−1/21) A(x)  +  (−27/28) L(x) + (C₁ − C₂).

Because the difference contains non-constant functions of x (A(x) and L(x)), it cannot be reduced to a mere constant. Therefore the two expressions are not the same antiderivative.

The two antiderivatives differ by more than an additive constant.  
Their logarithmic parts are identical, but the trigonometric parts cannot be transformed into each other up to a constant; calculating the derivative of the difference of the two candidate expressions does not give zero.  
Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two proposed antiderivatives differ in the trigonometric part:

• Candidate 1:   −3 arcsin ( x /[(x−1)√2] )
• Candidate 2:   +3 arctan ( [√(x²−4x+2) − (x−2)] / √2 )

To check equivalence we must see whether
 −3 arcsin ( … )  and  3 arctan ( … )
can differ only by an additive constant (which would still make the antiderivatives equivalent).

Compute derivatives with respect to y = x−2 (so √(x²−4x+2)=√(y²−2)=s):

1. d/dy[ arcsin((y+2)/((y+1)√2)) ] = −1 / [(y+1)s]
2. d/dy[ arctan((s − y)/√2) ] = (y − s) / [√2 s (y² − y s)]

The derivative of their linear combination
 d/dy[ arctan((s − y)/√2) + arcsin((y+2)/((y+1)√2)) ] 
is
 (y − s) / [√2 s (y² − y s)]  −  1 / [(y+1)s],

which is not identically zero; hence the two expressions are not related merely by a constant. Numerical tests at several y–values confirm the derivative is not zero and the difference between the two antiderivatives is not constant.

Therefore Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.
The two antiderivatives would have to differ only by an additive constant to be equivalent.  
Define  

t(x)= x /( (x-1)\sqrt 2 ),   u(x)= ((\sqrt 2-1)x-\sqrt 2)/\sqrt{x^{2}-4x+2}.  

Candidate 1 − Candidate 2 = −3 arcsin t(x) − 6 arctan u(x).

Test at two admissible points (where the integrand is defined):

1. x = 0  
   t = 0 ⇒ arcsin t = 0  
   u = −1 ⇒ arctan u = −π/4  
   Difference = −3·0 − 6·(−π/4) = −3π/2.

2. x = −1  
   t ≈ 0.353553 ⇒ arcsin t ≈ 0.361367  
   u ≈ −0.690 ⇒ arctan u ≈ −0.604  
   Difference ≈ −3·0.361367 − 6·(−0.604) ≈ −1.084 + 3.624 ≈ 2.540.

Since the difference takes different values at x = 0 and x = −1, it is not a constant.  
Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both expressions represent the same antiderivative.

By rewriting Candidate 1 in terms of cot (x/3) and using the identity csc² t = 1 + cot² t:

Candidate 1
= cot(t)·[ (8/15) + (4/15)csc²t + (1/5)csc⁴t ]
= cot(t)·[ (8/15) + (4/15)(1+cot²t) + (1/5)(1+2cot²t+cot⁴t) ]
= cot(t)·[ 1 + (2/3)cot²t + (1/5)cot⁴t ]
= cot(t) + (2/3)cot³(t) + (1/5)cot⁵(t) + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2 (up to the same arbitrary constant of integration).

Both candidates give the same radius of convergence (∞).  
For the sum, their formulas coincide for x ≠ 0:

3(x eˣ – eˣ + 1)/x².

However, Candidate 1 additionally specifies the value at x = 0 (3/2), providing a full piece-wise definition, while Candidate 2 leaves the expression undefined at x = 0 and supplies no separate value. Because the question asks for the sum of the entire power series (which includes x = 0), Candidate 2’s answer is incomplete relative to Candidate 1’s.

Hence the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates give the same radius of convergence (∞) and the same closed-form expression for the sum when x ≠ 0:
 3(e^x(x − 1)+1)/x^2.

However, the power-series sum is also defined at x = 0 (it equals 3/2).  
• Candidate 1 explicitly supplies this value with a piecewise definition.  
• Candidate 2 omits it; its single formula is undefined at x = 0.

Because the two proposed sums differ at x = 0, the answers are not fully identical for all x in the domain of the series.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

Candidate 1: κ(t) = 1 / [48 · |sin(t/2)|]  
Candidate 2: κ(t) = 1 / [48 · sin(t/2)]

These differ by the absolute-value operation. For any t where sin(t/2) < 0 (e.g., t in (π, 2π)), Candidate 1 yields a positive curvature while Candidate 2 yields a negative value, so the expressions are not the same. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ by the presence of an absolute-value sign in Candidate 1 that is missing in Candidate 2:

• Candidate 1:  κ = 1 / [48 · |sin(t/2)|]  
• Candidate 2:  κ = 1 / [48 · sin(t/2)]

For values of t where sin(t/2) is negative, Candidate 2 gives a negative curvature while Candidate 1 still gives a positive value. Hence the two answers are not mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates give two numerical answers:

2. approximate change: 0.65

They coincide digit-for-digit with the precision each candidate actually writes.  
However, Rule 4 requires us to check equality to SIX significant digits.  
The numbers supplied contain only four significant digits for 0.6449 and two significant digits for 0.65, so we cannot verify equality to the required six-digit precision. Under the rule, if the answers do not match to six significant digits, they are deemed inequivalent.

Therefore the two candidates are judged not equivalent.

while Candidate 2 writes it as

Both candidates ultimately state that the infinite series does not converge to a finite value.

• Candidate 1: “$S_k$ → None as $k$ → ∞.”  
   – Saying the sequence of partial sums tends to “None” means there is no limiting value; i.e., the series does not converge.

• Candidate 2: “diverges.”  
   – Explicitly says the series diverges.

Since “has no limit (None)” and “diverges” both communicate that the series fails to converge, the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 allows θ from 3π/2 to 5π/2, i.e. –π/2 to π/2 shifted by 2π, which covers both Quadrant IV and Quadrant I (the entire right-hand half–plane).  
Candidate 2 restricts θ to 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, covering only Quadrant I.  

Since the θ-ranges are not the same, the described regions are different. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different θ–intervals:

• Candidate 1: 3π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 5π/2 (covers both quadrant IV and quadrant I).  
• Candidate 2: 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 (covers only quadrant I).

Since the region requires both quadrants where cos θ ≥ 0 (i.e., −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2, or an equivalent interval of length π), Candidate 1 includes the whole required range while Candidate 2 includes only part of it. Thus the two descriptions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same formula except that Candidate 1 places absolute-value bars around the logarithm’s argument.

For the power series in question, the sum is only defined (as a real function) on the interval of convergence −1 < x < 1.  
On this interval the ratio (1+x)/(1−x) is strictly positive, so |x+1|/|x−1| = (1+x)/(1−x). Hence the absolute-value bars do not change the value of the logarithm anywhere the series converges.

Thus, within the domain where the series sum is meaningful, the two expressions coincide:

(1/4) ln(|x+1|/|x−1|) + (1/2) arctan x  =  (1/4) ln((1+x)/(1−x)) + (1/2) arctan x.

Therefore the two candidates are mathematically equivalent for the intended application.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the expression

(1/4) ln((1+x)/(1−x)) + (1/2) arctan x,

except that Candidate 1 encloses the numerator and denominator of the logarithm in absolute-value bars.  
For the domain where the original power series converges (|x|<1), both 1+x and 1−x are positive, so the absolute-value bars do nothing: |1+x| = 1+x and |1−x| = 1−x. Hence, on the relevant domain the two formulas are identical.  

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.
Both candidates give the same analytical expression up to the (inessential here) use of absolute-value signs inside the logarithm.

• Candidate 1:  (¼) ln(|x+1|/|x−1|) + ½ arctan x  
• Candidate 2:  (¼) ln((1+x)/(1−x)) + ½ arctan x.

Because the underlying series converges only for |x|<1, the factors (1+x) and (1−x) are positive in that interval, so the absolute-value bars in Candidate 1 do not change the value of the logarithm compared with Candidate 2. Hence the two expressions coincide on the domain relevant to the problem, and the additional absolute-value notation in Candidate 1 does not create a different function there.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

  (−3/√2, −√3/√2) ∪ (−√3/√2, 0) ∪ (0, √3/√2) ∪ (√3/√2, 3/√2)

• Candidate 2 lists the decreasing set as

  – which, being open intervals, contains x = 0 inside (−√6/2, √6/2).

Thus the two candidates disagree about whether the function is decreasing at x = 0, so their answers for item 6 are not identical. Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the overall submissions are not equivalent.

Because (x² – 2x + 2)e^x – 2 = 2e^x – 2xe^x + x²e^x – 2, the two expressions are algebraically identical.  
Candidate 1 additionally states the removable value f(0)=1/3, while Candidate 2 omits the explicit x=0 value; however, the question only asks for the series sum (which both give) and radius, so this does not create a disagreement. Hence the answers are equivalent.

The two expressions can be simplified to the same antiderivative.

Candidate 2 is
  F₂(x) = −cot x − (2/3) cot³x − (1/5) cot⁵x + C.

Candidate 1 is
  F₁(x) = −cos x/(5 sin⁵x) + (4/5)[−cos x/(3 sin³x) − (2/3) cot x].

Rewrite F₁ in terms of cot x and csc x (recall cot x = cos x/sin x and csc² x = 1 + cot² x):

F₁(x) = −cot x/15 [3 csc⁴ x + 4 csc² x + 8]
       = −cot x/15 [3(1 + cot² x)² + 4(1 + cot² x) + 8]
       = −cot x/15 [15 + 10 cot² x + 3 cot⁴ x]
       = −cot x − (2/3) cot³ x − (1/5) cot⁵ x + C.

Thus F₁(x) and F₂(x) differ only by an additive constant, i.e., they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both candidates represent antiderivatives that differ, at most, by a constant:

1. Simplify Candidate 1:
   -cot(x) term:               −8/15 cot x  
   −(cos/3 sin³) term:         −4/15 cot x (1+cot²)  
   −(cos/5 sin⁵) term:         −1/5 cot x (1+2 cot²+cot⁴)

   Collecting coefficients of cot, cot³, cot⁵ gives exactly
   −cot x − (2/3) cot³ x − (1/5) cot⁵ x.

2. Candidate 2 is precisely −cot x − (2/3) cot³ x − (1/5) cot⁵ x + C.

Hence Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are equivalent (they differ only by an additive constant).

The two candidates correspond to quite different integrals.

1.  Candidate 1 is  
   A₁ = ∫₀^{arccos(3/4)} (3 − 4 cos θ)² dθ.

   In polar‐area form the required factor ½ is absent, but the limits cover only half of the symmetric interval for the inner loop; because r² is even, that exactly compensates, so A₁ equals the inner–loop area.

2.  Candidate 2 is  
   A₂ = ½ ∫_{arccos(3/4)}^{2π − arccos(3/4)} (3 − 4 cos θ)² dθ.

   These limits cover the part of the curve where r is non-negative (essentially the outer region), and the ½ factor does not correct this. Numerically A₂ is far larger than A₁.

Since A₁ ≠ A₂, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two proposed integrals are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: ∫₀^{arccos(3/4)} (3 − 4 cos θ)² dθ

Candidate 2: ½ ∫_{arccos(3/4)}^{2π − arccos(3/4)} (3 − 4 cos θ)² dθ

Because Candidate 2 has an extra factor of ½ and integrates over a different (and much longer) θ–interval, its numerical value differs substantially from Candidate 1. Therefore, the two expressions cannot be equal.

Candidate 2 gives the series  

 Σ_{n=0}^{∞} [ (−1)^n (2n)! / (4^n (n!)^2 (2n+1)) ] x^{2n+1}.

Thus every coefficient contains the factor (−1)^n.

Candidate 1 lists the first few terms with alternating signs  

 x − (1/2)(x³/3) + (1·3)/(4·2)(x⁵/5) − (1·3·5)/(2·4·6)(x⁷/7) + ⋯,

but then states the general term only as  

 ((2n−1)!!)/(2n)!! · x^{2n+1}/(2n+1),

without the essential (−1)^n factor.  As written, the general term of Candidate 1 would give all positive coefficients, contradicting both its own preceding pattern and Candidate 2’s series.

Because Candidate 1’s formula lacks the alternating-sign factor, the two candidates are not exactly the same series.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The coefficients in Candidate 2 are

aₙ = (−1)ⁿ (2n)! / [4ⁿ (n!)² (2n+1)], multiplying x^{2n+1}.

In Candidate 1 the first several terms are

+ x  
− ½·x³/3 = −1/6 x³  
+ (1·3)/(4·2)·x⁵/5 = +3/40 x⁵  
− (1·3·5)/(2·4·6)·x⁷/7 = −5/112 x⁷, …

These numerical coefficients agree with Candidate 2 for n = 0,1,2,3.

However, the “general term” that Candidate 1 writes is

( (2n−1)!! / (2n)!! ) · x^{2n+1} / (2n+1)

with no (−1)ⁿ factor.  
Since (2n−1)!! / (2n)!! = (2n)! / [4ⁿ (n!)²] is always positive, Candidate 1’s written general term would make every coefficient positive from that point on. For odd n (n = 1,3,5,…), Candidate 2’s coefficients are negative, so beyond the first few terms the two series would disagree.

Thus the explicit formulae given by the two candidates are not the same; Candidate 1 omits the alternating sign in its general term. Consequently, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical coefficients in front of π:

Both answers are single numerical coefficients multiplying \(R^3\).

Candidate 1 coefficient: \( \frac{4}{3\sqrt{3}} \approx 0.769800 \)

Candidate 2 coefficient: \( \frac{8\sqrt{3}}{9} \approx 1.53960 \)

Since these differ (indeed, Candidate 2 is exactly twice Candidate 1), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The numerical coefficients differ:

• Candidate 1: 4 / (3 √3) ≈ 0.769800…
• Candidate 2: 1 / (3 √3) ≈ 0.192450…

Candidate 1 is four times Candidate 2, so the answers are not the same.

The problem asks for the complete set of rational x such that  
y = √(x² + x + 3) is rational.

Candidate 1 supplies a single one-parameter description  
 x = (q² – 3)/(1 – 2q)  (with q rational, the natural interpretation).  
This parameterization is known to produce every rational solution (indeed, for every rational x with rational y one can take q = –x + y).

Candidate 2 lists
 • the specific values x = 2 and x = –3, and  
 • two parameter families  
  x = (11b² – 2b – 1)/(4b)  and x = (b² – 2b – 11)/(4b)  
   for odd integers b.

To test equivalence, pick a rational x produced by Candidate 1 and check if Candidate 2 also produces it.

Take q = 1/4 in Candidate 1:  
 x = [(1/4)² – 3] / (1 – 2·¼) = (1/16 – 3) / (½) = –47/8.  
For this x, y = 45/8 is rational, so –47/8 is indeed a valid solution.

Now see if Candidate 2 can yield –47/8.  
Solve (11b² – 2b – 1)/(4b)=–47/8 and (b² – 2b – 11)/(4b)=–47/8 under the stated restriction “odd integers b”.  
Both equations give b = –2 or b = –22 or b = 1/22, none of which are odd integers.  
Thus –47/8 is not contained in Candidate 2’s set.

Therefore the two candidates produce different answer sets.  By Rule 2/Rule 3 (different lists for a question that requires the complete list), the predictions are not equivalent.

The question requires five separate answers, each with a specific unit implied or stated.

• For Q1–Q3 the required units are explicitly given in the question (lbs, quarts, pints).  
• For Q4 the unit of the result is NOT specified; a reasonable answer could be either “6000 kg” or “6 metric tons.”  
• For Q5 the quotient could be expressed either in pounds‐decimal form or in pounds-and-ounces.

Candidate 2 supplies explicit units for every sub-answer.  
Candidate 1 omits all units; in Q4 and Q5 this omission leaves genuine ambiguity because more than one unit could reasonably be used.

Hence at least one sub-answer is not unequivocally the same between the two candidates, so the two overall predictions are not equivalent.
Both candidates give five answers, matching the five sub-questions.

Sub-answer comparison:
1. 4  vs. 4 lb → numerical value identical; required unit is pounds, so C1’s bare “4” is implicitly 4 lb.
2. 4  vs. 4 quarts → identical value; quarts are explicitly asked for.
3. 4  vs. 4 pints → identical value; pints are explicitly asked for.
4. 6000 vs. 6000 kg → identical value; the natural, unambiguous unit for this computation is kilograms (6 t would be “6”, not “6000”), so C1’s “6000” implicitly matches 6000 kg.
5. 10.25 vs. 10.25 lb → identical value; result is naturally in pounds and C1’s number matches C2.

Since every corresponding answer is the same numerical value and the omitted units in Candidate 1’s responses are unambiguous from the question context, the two sets of predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates give expressions for all six second-order partial derivatives.  
For each derivative, the two numerators differ only by an obvious common factor that has been distributed:

1. fₓₓ: −2 x y³ z³/(1+x²y²z²)²  =  −2 x y³ z³/(1+x²y²z²)²  
2. fₓʸ: (z − x²y²z³)/(1+x²y²z²)²  =  z(1 − x²y²z²)/(1+x²y²z²)²  
3. fₓ𝓏: (y − x²y³z²)/(1+x²y²z²)²  =  y(1 − x²y²z²)/(1+x²y²z²)²  
4. fʸʸ: −2 x³ y z³/(1+x²y²z²)²  =  −2 x³ y z³/(1+x²y²z²)²  
5. fʸ𝓏: (x − x³y²z²)/(1+x²y²z²)²  =  x(1 − x²y²z²)/(1+x²y²z²)²  
6. f𝓏𝓏: −2 x³ y³ z/(1+x²y²z²)²  =  −2 x³ y³ z/(1+x²y²z²)²  

Because z(1 − x²y²z²) = z − x²y²z³, y(1 − x²y²z²) = y − x²y³z², etc., each corresponding pair is identical. Therefore the two sets of answers are equivalent.

Reasoning:

Let α = ω to compare term-by-term.

1. Cos(ωx) coefficient  
   • Candidate 1: (2α sin 2α + cos 2α – 1)/α²  
     = 2 sin 2α/α + (cos 2α – 1)/α²  

   • Candidate 2: 4 sin 2ω/ω + 2(cos 2ω – 1)/ω²  
     = 2[ 2 sin 2α/α + (cos 2α – 1)/α² ]

   ⇒ Candidate 2’s coefficient is exactly twice Candidate 1’s.

2. Sin(ωx) coefficient  
   • Candidate 1: (sin 2α – 2α cos 2α)/α²  
     = sin 2α/α² – 2 cos 2α/α  

   • Candidate 2: –4 cos 2ω/ω + 2 sin 2ω/ω²  
     = 2[ sin 2α/α² – 2 cos 2α/α ]

   ⇒ Again, Candidate 2’s coefficient is twice Candidate 1’s.

Thus the entire integrand in Candidate 2 is 2 × the integrand in Candidate 1. With the same limits of integration, Candidate 2 represents twice the function given by Candidate 1, so the two answers are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives differ essentially by the factor  
ln(−1)/√13 = i π/√13.  
For real‐valued antiderivatives the constant of integration must be a real number, and Candidate 1 involves ln of a negative quantity (hence a non-real value) wherever the integrand is defined, while Candidate 2 keeps the expression real by using absolute values.  
Therefore the two results are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives differ by the factor “−1’’ inside the logarithm:

• Candidate 1 uses (1/√13) ln [ −(A−√13)/(A+√13) ]  
• Candidate 2 uses (1/√13) ln | (A−√13)/(A+√13) |

where A = x+4+√(x²+2x+5).

Because the sign of A−√13 changes with x, the quantity −(A−√13)/(A+√13) is **not** merely a constant multiple of (A−√13)/(A+√13); its sign (and therefore the reality of the logarithm) varies with x. Consequently the two expressions are not related by an x-independent constant on the whole real domain where the integrand is defined.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates give an antiderivative of the form  

(1/√13) ln|expression(x)| + constant .

Let  
S = √(x² + 2x + 5) and y = x + 1.

Candidate 1’s logarithmic argument reduces to  
R₁ = (√13 − 4 − x − S)/(4 + √13 + x + S)  
        = −(y + S + 3 − √13)/(y + S + 3 + √13).

Candidate 2 (after using the prefactor “−” already present) effectively involves  
R₂ = [3S − (2 − √13)y − 6]/[3S − (2 + √13)y − 6].

One finds algebraically (and is confirmed numerically for several x-values) that  
R₂ = κ R₁, where the constant  
κ = (√13 + 1)/(√13 − 1) ≈ 1.767766…  
is independent of x and strictly positive.

Therefore  
ln|R₂| = ln|κR₁| = ln|R₁| + ln κ,  
and the two antiderivatives differ only by the additive constant (1/√13) ln κ.

Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 provide equivalent answers.

Both expressions can be rewritten in terms of cot and csc.

Let t = cot(11x).

Candidate 1:
F₁ = ½ t⁴ − t² + ln(1+t²)

Candidate 2, noting csc²(11x)=1+t² and ln|sin| = −½ ln(1+t²):
F₂ = ½(1+t²)² − 2(1+t²) − 2 ln|sin|
    = ½ t⁴ − t² − 2 ln|sin| − 3/2
    = ½ t⁴ − t² + ln(1+t²) − 3/2

Hence
F₂ − F₁ = –3/2,

a constant. The two antiderivatives differ only by an additive constant, so they represent the same family of functions for the indefinite integral.

–(3/2)x + 3 arcsin(x/2) – (3/2)C. The term –(3/2)C is just another arbitrary integration constant, so it can be absorbed into the “+ C” of Candidate 2.

Thus the two expressions differ only by a constant and are mathematically the same antiderivative.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give

3x ln(√(2−x)+√(2+x)) − (3/2)x + 3 arcsin(x/2)  

plus an arbitrary constant of integration.  

Candidate 1 writes the constant as −(3/2)C, while Candidate 2 writes it as +C; since an arbitrary constant multiplied by the non-zero factor −3/2 is still an arbitrary constant, the two antiderivatives differ only by a constant. Therefore they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both answers give the same first (algebraic) term  
 (x – 10) √((x+2)/(x–2)).

The only possible difference is in the logarithmic term:

Candidate 1:  –6 ln | (√(x–2) – √(x+2)) / (√(x–2) + √(x+2)) |

Candidate 2:  –6 ln | x – √(x² – 4) |

Let a = √(x – 2) and b = √(x + 2).  
Then √(x²–4) = ab.

Compute

( a – b )² / ( a + b )²  
= (a² + b² – 2ab)/(a² + b² + 2ab)  
= (x – ab)/(x + ab),

so

| (a – b)/(a + b) | = √( |x – ab| / |x + ab| ).

Hence

ln |(a – b)/(a + b)| = ½ [ ln|x – ab| – ln|x + ab| ].

Therefore

–6 ln |(a – b)/(a + b)|  
= –3 ln|x – ab| + 3 ln|x + ab|  
= –6 ln|x – ab| + 6·½ ln|x – ab| + 6·½ ln|x + ab|  
= –6 ln|x – ab| + 6·½ ln|(x – ab)(x + ab)|  
= –6 ln|x – ab| + 6·½ ln|x² – (ab)²|  
= –6 ln|x – ab| + 6·½ ln 4  
= –6 ln|x – √(x² – 4)| – 6 ln 2.

Thus the logarithmic parts of the two candidates differ only by the constant –6 ln 2.  
Because indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary additive constant, this difference is immaterial.

Consequently, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 represent the same antiderivative (they differ only by an overall constant).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions give antiderivatives that differ only by the additive constant (they match exactly in the algebraic term and their logarithmic terms differ by the constant 6 ln 2).

Both candidates represent the same antiderivative up to an additive constant:

1. Rewrite Candidate 1 with y = x + 5:
   F₁(x) = D + 5(x+5) + [(½(x+5)² − 5(x+5)) ln(x+5)] − ¼(x+5)²  
          = [(x² − 25)/2] ln(x+5) + (5/2)x − ¼x² + (75/4 + D).

2. Candidate 2 is
   F₂(x) = [(x² − 25)/2] ln(5 + x) + (5/2)x − ¼x² + C.

The two expressions differ only by the constant (75/4 + D) − C, which is acceptable for an indefinite integral. Hence the answers are equivalent.

Both candidates present the same completed-square form:

1. Candidate 1: 2·(x − 1.5)² − 13.5
2. Candidate 2: 2·(x − 3/2)² − 27/2

Note that
• 1.5 = 3/2, so the squared terms are identical.
• 13.5 = 27/2, so the constant terms are identical (and both are negated).

Thus the two expressions are mathematically identical.
The two candidates both rewrite the quadratic as 

2 (x – 3/2)² – 13.5

Candidate 1 writes it as 2·(x – 1.5)² – 13.5, while Candidate 2 writes it as 2 (x – 3/2)² – 27/2.  
Because 1.5 = 3/2 and 27/2 = 13.5, the two expressions are mathematically identical.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 must match on all three requested items.

1. Concave-up set  
   • Candidate 1: (−∞, −1) ∪ (−1, 0) ∪ (0, ∞)  → excludes x = −1 and x = 0.  
   • Candidate 2: (−∞, ∞)  → includes every real x, in particular x = −1 and x = 0.

   These two sets are not the same; Candidate 2 adds two points that Candidate 1 omits.

2. Concave-down set: both say “none” (match).

3. Inflection points: both say “none” (match).

Because the concave-up answers differ, the overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 8).

The overall multiplicative factor and the arctangent argument are in fact identical:

1. Factor:
   3 / √7  =  3√7 / 7

2. Argument:
   (1/√7)(1 + 2 tan x) = (2 tan x + 1)/√7

Thus the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by a constant of integration, meaning they represent the same family of antiderivative functions.

Candidate 2:  (3/√7) arctan[(2 tan x+1)/√7] + C

Since (1+2 tan x) = (2 tan x+1), the arguments of the arctan functions are identical, the prefactors are identical, and both include an arbitrary constant of integration C. Hence the two answers are mathematically the same.

Both expressions can be rewritten in the same form:

Candidate 1  
= (1/16)[2 (arctan 2x)² + 2 ln(4x²+1) + 8x² (arctan 2x)² − 8x arctan 2x] + C  
= (1/8)(arctan 2x)² + (1/8)ln(4x²+1) + (1/2)x² (arctan 2x)² − (1/2)x arctan 2x + C.

Candidate 2  
= (4x²+1)/8 · (arctan 2x)² − (x/2) arctan 2x + (1/8)ln(1+4x²) + C  
= (1/8)(arctan 2x)² + (1/2)x² (arctan 2x)² − (1/2)x arctan 2x + (1/8)ln(4x²+1) + C.

After simplification, each term in Candidate 1 matches exactly the corresponding term in Candidate 2 (up to the arbitrary integration constant). Therefore, the two antiderivatives are equivalent.

Candidate 1  
F₁ = (3/8) sin 4x + (9/128) sin 8x + (15/16) x − (1/32)(sin 4x)³  
Using sin³θ = (3 sin θ − sin 3θ)/4 gives  
F₁ = 45/128 sin 4x + 9/128 sin 8x + 1/128 sin 12x + 15/16 x + C.

Candidate 2  
F₂ = 45/16 sin 4x + 9/16 sin 8x + 1/16 sin 12x + 15/2 x + C.

Clearly F₂ = 8 F₁ (up to the additive constant). A multiplicative factor other than 1 means the two antiderivatives cannot differ only by a constant; thus they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give explicit formulas for the same single quantity (the third derivative), so Rule 2’s single-answer requirement is satisfied.

Algebraic comparison:

Candidate 2  
  2/(x+7)^3 – 2/(x–7)^3  
 = 2[(x–7)^3 – (x+7)^3] / [(x+7)^3(x–7)^3]  
 = 2[–14(3x²+49)] / [(x²–49)³]  
 = (–84x² – 1372) / (x²–49)³.

Candidate 1 is (–84x² – 1372)/(x²–49)³.

These are identical expressions; hence the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1 can be rewritten into exactly this form by expanding the outer “–3( … )”, so every term (including the logarithmic term) has the same coefficient as in Candidate 2.  
Since the two expressions differ at most by the (arbitrary) additive constant, they are equivalent antiderivatives.

Per the rules, the answers are identical in content and form; hence they are equivalent.

Both candidates express the antiderivative in terms of the same four elementary pieces:

1. (2x − 3)^{5/4}
2. (2x − 3)^{3/4}
3. (2x − 3)^{1/4}
4. arctan((2x − 3)^{1/4}/√3)

After distributing the outside factor 2 in Candidate 1, its coefficients become

• 2 × (1/5) = 2/5  
• 2 × (−2/3) = −4/3  
• 2 × 9 = 18  
• 2 × (−27/√3) = −54/√3 = −18√3

Thus Candidate 1 simplifies to

(2/5)(2x − 3)^{5/4} − (4/3)(2x − 3)^{3/4} + 18(2x − 3)^{1/4} − 18√3 arctan((2x − 3)^{1/4}/√3) + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2. Both results differ, if at all, only by an arbitrary constant of integration, which is allowed.

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both answers can be rewritten with  
a = (2x − 3)^{1/4}.

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
18 a + (2/5) a⁵ − (4/3) a³ − 18√3 arctan(a/√3) + C.

Candidate 2 is exactly  
18 a + (2/5) a⁵ − (4/3) a³ − 18√3 arctan(a/√3) + C.

Thus the two expressions differ only by an arbitrary constant of integration (both already include “+ C”), so they represent the same antiderivative.

Both candidates give values for the largest and smallest values, but:

1. Candidate 1 also supplies the coordinates of the interior extrema, while Candidate 2 does not. So the two answer sets are not the same collection of sub-answers required by the original problem.

2. For the “smallest value,” Candidate 1 states −1.8023 (≈ −1.80230 to six significant digits), whereas Candidate 2 gives (1 − 16√2)/12 ≈ −1.8022848.  
   Comparing to six significant digits:  
   −1.80230 vs. −1.80228 differ in the 5th–6th significant digits, so they are numerically unequal by Rule 4.

Because Candidate 2 omits the extrema information and the smallest‐value numbers do not match to six significant digits, the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for both the extrema points ​and​ the largest and smallest values on the interval.  

• Candidate 1 supplies all three extrema points and the requested largest/smallest values.  
• Candidate 2 supplies only the largest and smallest values, omitting the extrema points entirely.

Because Candidate 2 does not provide every required answer, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 2 gives the curve
 x = 0.

These are clearly different sets of points for almost every value of c: the first is (in general) an ellipse, while the second is a straight vertical line. They coincide only in no meaningful range of c, so the two answers are not mathematically equivalent.

The curve described by Candidate 1 is the ellipse

a two-dimensional set of infinitely many points (assuming 0 < c < 8 so the denominators are positive).

Candidate 2 gives the conditions

  x = 0, y² = 256 − c²,

which represent at most the two isolated points (0, ±√(256 − c²)).  
These two points are not the same set as the entire ellipse given in Candidate 1 (except in the degenerate case where the ellipse collapses, which is not specified in the problem).

Because the geometric loci are different, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for the expectation values of 2 sₓ and 2 s_z, whose eigenvalues are ±ħ.

• Candidate 2 gives ⟨2 sₓ⟩ = –sin[ω(t–t₀)], ⟨2 s_z⟩ = 0, with no factor of ħ in front and no explicit statement that ω contains ħ.

Even if we identify ω = 2 μ_e B/ħ, Candidate 2’s amplitude is 1 (dimensionless) whereas the correct physical quantity should have amplitude ħ. The omission of that factor means the two answers differ in both numerical value and units.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two expectation values: ⟨2 sₓ⟩ and ⟨2 s_z⟩.

• For ⟨2 s_z⟩: both candidates give 0 → they agree on this part.

• For ⟨2 sₓ⟩:
  – Candidate 1: −ħ sin[(2 μ_e/ħ) B (t–t₀)]  (has an overall factor of ħ).
  – Candidate 2: −sin[ω (t–t₀)]  (no ħ factor; only a dimensionless sine).

Even if one identifies ω = (2 μ_e/ħ) B, the multiplicative factor ħ remains present in Candidate 1 but absent in Candidate 2, so the two expressions differ in magnitude and in units. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical values.

• Candidate 1: 0.702 → interpreted to six significant digits as 0.702000  
• Candidate 2: 512/729 ≈ 0.702331

Since 0.702000 ≠ 0.702331 when compared to six significant digits, the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same normalized spinor up to an overall (global) phase factor:

(i, 1)ᵀ = i (1, −i)ᵀ.

Since multiplying a spinor by a non-zero complex constant does not change its status as an eigenfunction (and the normalization remains unchanged), the two answers represent the same physical and mathematical eigenstate of  ŝ_y with eigenvalue −½.

The question has three sub-parts, so each candidate must supply three matching answers for their responses to be equivalent.

1. Ground-state energy  
   • C1:  π²ħ²/(2ma²)  
   • C2:  π²ħ²/(2ma²)  
   → Match.

2. Momentum-probability density  
   • C1 (for p≠0):  f(p)= 8aπ/ħ · cos²(pa/2ħ) /[(pa/ħ)²–π²]²  
     → Simplifies to 8aπħ³ cos² … /(π²ħ²–p²a²)².  
   • C2:  f(p)= 4πaħ³ cos²(pa/2ħ)/(π²ħ²–p²a²)².  

   The two expressions differ by an overall factor of 2 for p≠0. (For p=0 both give 4a/(π³ħ) due to the limit, but elsewhere they are not equal.) Hence the sub-answers are different.

3. Energy after expansion & conservation comment  
   • Both give π²ħ²/(2ma²) and claim energy conserved.  
   → Match.

Because sub-answer #2 disagrees, the sets of answers are not identical, so the candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The problem has two parts, so each candidate must give two answers.  
Both candidates supply two answers, but:

Part (a):  
• Candidate 1:  +e²F² / (2k)  
• Candidate 2:  −e²F² / (2k)  
These differ in sign, so they are not the same.

Part (b): both give the same expression, but because part (a) differs, the overall sets of answers are not identical.

Hence, the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 only supplies two bare equations—one for the photoelectric effect and one for black-body radiation—without any description of the experiments, their non-classical features, or the quantum interpretation that the question explicitly requests.  

Candidate 2, in contrast, gives prose explanations of the photoelectric effect and black-body radiation, identifies the non-classical observations, and mentions the quantization ideas that resolve them.

Because the two answers differ greatly in content and completeness, they are not equivalent per Rule 9 (required information omitted by Candidate 1).

The two candidates must match on every one of the 12 requested numerical answers.  
Already for item (a) they differ:

• (a) Candidate 1: 2.43 × 10⁻¹² m  
• (a) Candidate 2: 2.4 × 10⁻¹² m  

Expressed with the same exponent (10⁻¹²) and to six significant digits they are 2.43000 vs. 2.40000, which are not identical.  
Since at least one sub-answer is different, the two overall answer sets are not equivalent.
The question asks for 12 separate numerical values (parts a–l).  
Both candidates give 12 answers, but when the individual numbers are compared they are not identical:

Example:  
(a) Candidate 1: 2.43 × 10⁻¹² m, Candidate 2: 2.4 × 10⁻¹² m → 2.43000 vs 2.40000 (different to 6 significant digits).

The problem asks for two distinct answers, (a) and (b).  
• For (a) both candidates give the same expression: 2^{5/4} (√2 − 1), so they coincide there.  
• For (b) the times are

 Candidate 1: T = N′ π √(M / 2k) = π /(√2 ω₁) · N′

 Candidate 2: T = 2√2 π n / ω₁ = π /(√2 ω₁) · 4n

These two sets of times differ by a factor of 4 in their integer multipliers; Candidate 2’s times are only a subset of Candidate 1’s, so they are not the same answer.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 supplies three distinct numerical answers corresponding to α, K, and the numerical ground-state energy ε(m = 1 g).  
Candidate 2 gives only one formula for ε and omits α and K entirely; even the energy it gives is not evaluated numerically.

Since the problem requires three separate results and Candidate 2 does not provide them, the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both sub-answers must match.

1. State vector  
   • Candidate 1 gives ψ₁(t)=e^{-iωt}/√2 (1, i)^T.  
   • Candidate 2 gives ψ₂(t)=1/√2 (e^{-iωt/2}, i e^{+iωt/2})^T.  
   Taking out any overall (global) phase from ψ₂ leaves the component ratio (second/first) equal to i e^{iωt}, whereas for ψ₁ that ratio is simply i. Because the relative phase between components is different (time-dependent versus constant), the two state vectors are not the same up to a global phase.

2. Expectation value  
   • Candidate 1: ⟨s_x⟩ = –(ħ/2) sin(2ωt)  
   • Candidate 2: ⟨s_x⟩ = –(ħ/2) sin(ωt)  
   The arguments of the sine differ by a factor of 2, so the results are unequal.

Since both required parts disagree, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.  
1. Their state vectors differ by more than a global phase: Candidate 1’s relative phase between the spin-up and spin-down components is fixed (constant i), whereas Candidate 2’s relative phase evolves in time as e^{-i ω t}.  
2. The predicted expectation values of s_x differ: Candidate 1 gives −(ħ/2) sin(2 ω t) while Candidate 2 gives −(ħ/2) sin(ω t).  
Because both required sub-answers disagree, the candidates are inequivalent.

• Candidate 2: 2.426 × 10⁻⁸ cm (formula ħ/mc)  

These differ by two orders of magnitude, far outside the 6-significant-digit tolerance, so Rule 4 is violated.

Sub-problem (i) “typical hydrogen fine-structure splitting” also shows a substantial discrepancy (1.8 × 10⁻⁴ eV vs 7.25 × 10⁻⁴ eV).

Because at least one sub-answer is different, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates give formulas that are symbolically identical except for the mass symbol:  

• Candidate 1 uses “μ” in the denominator.  
• Candidate 2 uses “m” in the denominator.  

Because the problem involves only a single electron, the natural mass symbol is “m” (the electron mass). The symbol “μ” is commonly reserved for a reduced mass and is not explicitly defined here. Since nothing in the statements tells us that μ = m, we must treat the symbols as representing potentially different quantities. Therefore the two expressions cannot be assumed to be the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidate answers express the wavelength in different units, but converting them to the same unit shows they are very different:

• Candidate 1: 110 Å  = 110 × 0.1 nm = 11 nm

11 nm ≠ 350 nm, so the answers are not equivalent.

The problem has two sub-parts, so both candidates must give two corresponding answers.

Sub-answer (a):
• Candidate 1 gives “tan δ₀ = −k r₀”.
• Candidate 2 gives “δ₀(k) = −k r₀”.

These are not the same: δ₀ = −k r₀ differs from tan δ₀ = −k r₀ except in the small-angle limit. Hence the two candidates disagree on the functional form of the s-wave phase shift.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Both expressions are algebraically identical:

Starting from Candidate 1:
|c|² = b₀² / [4 m² ω² (4 ω² + τ⁻²)]

Multiply numerator and denominator by τ²:
|c|² = (b₀² τ²) / [4 m² ω² (4 ω² τ² + 1)]
         = (b₀² τ²) / [4 m² ω² (1 + 4 ω² τ²)]

This is exactly Candidate 2.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates give the same list of accessible quantum numbers (5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15), so they agree on part (a).

For part (b) we compare their probability expressions:

Candidate 1  
P₁ = (π/4)(15!/10!)(α/ħ)²(ħ/2mω)⁵ τ² e^{-25ω²τ²/2}  
  = π α² ħ³ τ² (15·14·13·12·11) e^{-25ω²τ²/2} / (128 m⁵ ω⁵)

Candidate 2  
P₂ = π α² ħ³ τ² (15·14·13·12·11) e^{-25ω²τ²/2} / (32 m⁵ ω⁵)

The two expressions differ by an overall factor of 4 (1/128 vs 1/32). Hence the probabilities are not the same.

Because the answers to sub-problem (b) are different, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question has two sub-parts, (a) and (b).

(a) Both candidates state that the positronium Coulomb energies are one-half the hydrogen energies.  
• Candidate 1: \(E_n = -\frac{1}{4n^{2}}\alpha^{2}m_ec^{2}\) (hydrogen would be \(-\frac{1}{2n^{2}}\alpha^{2}m_ec^{2}\)).  
• Candidate 2: “half those of hydrogen”.  
These are equivalent.

(b) The question asks what spin–spin and external field do to the level.  
• Candidate 1 supplies explicit formulas for four states with numerical coefficients.  
• Candidate 2 only states that the 4-fold level splits into a singlet and a triplet and that the external field Zeeman-splits the triplet.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 therefore give different, non-matching answers for part (b): one presents detailed energy shifts, the other only a qualitative description. Because the answers are not identical for every required sub-answer, the candidates are NOT equivalent according to Rule 2.

The question asks for two specific formulas: one in the rectilinear basis and one in the spherical basis.  

• Both candidates give the same rectilinear-basis formula.  
• For the spherical-basis formula, Candidate 1 gives  
 E = ħω (k + ½),  
whereas Candidate 2 gives  
 E = ħω (2k + ℓ + 3⁄2).

These two expressions are not the same (they depend on different combinations of k and ℓ). Therefore the candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

The question has four explicit sub-parts (a)–(d), each demanding a definite answer.  
To be equivalent, the two candidates must give the same content for every sub-part.

Comparison:

(a) Hamiltonian  
• Candidate 1: specific form with a constant field multiplied by θ(t) (step function).  
• Candidate 2: generic −q E(t) x.  → not the same expression.

(b) Eigenvalue problem / relation of states  
• Candidate 1: gives a momentum-translation similarity transform.  
• Candidate 2: says “shifted oscillator eigenstates” without the same explicit formula.  → not identical.

(c) Excitation probability after the switch–on  
• Candidate 1: P = 1 − exp(−q²ℰ²/(2mω³ħ)).  
• Candidate 2: Poisson distribution with parameter |α|² = (q²/(2mωħ))|∫E dt|², giving P_exc = 1 − exp(−|α|²).  The two formulas only match if one sets |α|² equal to Candidate 1’s constant, i.e. only in a very special case; in general they differ.

(d) Perturbation-theory probabilities  
• Candidate 1: P_e = π q²/(mωħ)|ℰ(ω)|², and for the exponential pulse a result ∝1/(1+(ωτ)⁻²).  
• Candidate 2: P_1(t)= q²/(2mωħ)|∫ℰ e^{iωt’}dt’|², and for the exponential pulse a quite different time-dependent magnitude.  Numerical factors and time dependence disagree.

Since the answers disagree in several sub-parts, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
First, the problem has four separate sub-parts, so each candidate must give a (mutually consistent) answer for (a), (b), (c) and (d).

Comparison of the two sets of answers:

(a) Hamiltonian  
• Candidate 1: \(H= \frac{p^{2}}{2m}+ \frac12 m\omega^{2}x^{2}-q\mathcal E x\,\theta(t)\) (step-function constant field)  
• Candidate 2: \(H(t)=\frac{p^{2}}{2m}+ \frac12 m\omega^{2}x^{2}-qE(t)x\) (arbitrary time-profile)  
These are plainly different; C-1 is a special case of C-2, not the same expression.

(b) Exact eigenproblem  
The two descriptions differ in notation and neither list identical explicit eigenvalues; not the same answer.

(c) Excitation probability  
• C-1: \(P_e = 1-\exp\!\left[-\dfrac{q^{2}\mathcal E^{2}}{2m\omega^{3}\hbar}\right]\)  
• C-2: \(P_e = 1-e^{-|\alpha|^{2}}\), \( \alpha=\frac{q}{m\omega^{2}}\!\int_{0}^{t}\!E(t')e^{-i\omega(t-t')}dt'\)  
Numerically and functionally these are not the same (different dependence on the field, ω, ħ, etc.).

(d) Perturbative result  
Although the specific exponential-pulse formula coincidentally simplifies to the same expression for the two candidates, part (d) alone is not enough; all sub-answers must match, per Rule 2. Because parts (a)–(c) disagree, the overall answers are not equivalent.

Hence the two candidates are NOT equivalent.

Both candidates supply explicit numerical/analytical expressions for every part of the question, so we can compare each piece directly.

Sub-problem (a):
• Single–particle energies: Candidate 1 gives (n + ½)ħω – λ²/(2mω²); Candidate 2 gives (n + ½)ħω.  These are different.
• Ground-state wavefunctions: different as well (shifted Gaussians vs ordinary harmonic oscillator).
• Two-particle ground-state energy: Candidate 1 gives ħω – λ²/(mω²); Candidate 2 gives ħω.  Different.

Sub-problem (b):
First-order correction and stated ground-state wavefunctions also disagree.

Because at least one answer in every required part differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent under Rule 2 (and there is no compensating equivalence under any other rule).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different explicit formulas for every requested quantity:

1.  First-order energy corrections  
   • Candidate 1: \(E_{\pm}= (2\pm\varepsilon)\hbar\omega\) (with an undefined parameter \(\varepsilon\))  
   • Candidate 2: \(E^{(1)}_{\pm}= \pm\frac{K\hbar}{2m\omega}\)

2.  Second-order energy corrections  
   • Candidate 1: \(E^{(2)}=-2\varepsilon^{2}\hbar\omega\)  
   • Candidate 2: \(E^{(2)}=-\frac{K^{2}\hbar}{8m^{2}\omega^{3}}\)

3.  First-order wave-function corrections  
   • Candidate 1: \(|\pm\rangle=|\pm\rangle^{(0)}-\varepsilon(|12\rangle\mp|21\rangle)\)  
   • Candidate 2: \(|\psi\rangle\approx|n\rangle-\frac{K}{4m\omega^{2}}|m\rangle\)

Unless one arbitrarily defines \(\varepsilon=K\hbar/(2m\omega)\), the answers plainly differ, and even with that identification the second-order terms do not match. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts, so each candidate must give three corresponding answers.  
For sub-parts (a) and (b) the formulas from the two candidates differ by the factor ħ:

Sub-part (a)  
• Candidate 1: cos²[(m₂−m₁)c² t / 2ħ]  
• Candidate 2: cos²[(E₂−E₁)t / 2]  (missing ħ)

Sub-part (b)  
• Candidate 1: t = πħ / [(m₂−m₁)c²]  
• Candidate 2: t = π / (E₂−E₁)  (again missing ħ)

Because ħ carries units, omitting it changes both the numerical value and the dimensional consistency. Therefore the answers to parts (a) and (b) are not equivalent, so the entire sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates respond to part (c).  
However:

• Part (a): Candidate 1 gives an explicit answer; Candidate 2 gives none.  
• Part (b): Candidate 1 supplies a brief explanation; Candidate 2 says nothing.  

Because Candidate 2 omits required sub-answers while Candidate 1 supplies them, the two submissions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The problem requires two answers (parts (a) and (b)).  
Both candidates give expressions for part (a) and a comment on part (b), so the number of answers matches.  
However, the actual formulas are different:

• Candidate 1 (part (a))  
 E₀ ≤ (ħ²/4m)(1 + 1/n) [ λ m (2n)! / (ħ² 2^{2(n-1)} (n-1)! ) ]^{1/(n+1)}

• Candidate 2 (part (a))  
 E = (n+1)/(4n) [ 2 λ n (2n-1)!! ]^{1/(n+1)}

Candidate 2’s result contains no factors of ħ or m, while Candidate 1’s result does; they cannot be made identical by simple algebraic rearrangement unless one implicitly sets ħ = m = 1, which the question does not state. Even aside from units, the numerical factors differ (e.g., 2^{2-n} vs 2). Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem has two sub-parts, so each candidate must supply two corresponding answers.

Part (a):  
• Candidate 1 gives E₀ ≤ (ħ²/4m)(1+1/n)[λ m (2n)!/(ħ² 2^{2(n-1)}(n-1)!)]^{1/(n+1)}.  
• Candidate 2 gives E₀ ≤ (n+1)/(4n)[4 λ n (2n−1)!!/2^{n}]^{1/(n+1)}.

These formulas are plainly different: Candidate 2’s expression lacks ħ and m factors and uses double factorial rather than ordinary factorial; numerical coefficients also differ.

Part (b):  
• Candidate 1: (ħ/2)√(2λ/m).  
• Candidate 2: √(λ/2).

Again they differ by factors of ħ and m.

Since at least one answer in each sub-part is not the same, the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The problem asks for three separate quantities:
1. Differential cross-section dσ/dΩ.
2. Total cross-section σ.
3. Imaginary part of the forward amplitude Im f(0).

Candidate 1 supplies explicit expressions for all three.

Candidate 2 gives only two expressions.  
• Its first expression for dσ/dΩ matches Candidate 1’s.  
• Its second expression matches Candidate 1’s Im f(0), not Candidate 1’s total cross-section, and therefore it neither equals the total cross-section given by Candidate 1 nor provides a separate Im f(0) entry.

Thus Candidate 2 is missing one of the required answers (or has mis-identified it), so the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.

The answers must match for every sub-part of the question.  
Although both candidates give the same values for ⟨r⟩, ⟨r²⟩, r₍mp₎ and ⟨T⟩, they disagree on

• the probability of finding the electron inside the nucleus (1.76 × 10⁻¹⁴ vs. 9.0 × 10⁻¹⁵), and  
• the overall normalization/constant factor in the momentum-space wave-function.

Since at least one required sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
We compare sub-answer by sub-answer.

(a) Both candidates give  
⟨r⟩ = 3a₀/2, ⟨r²⟩ = 3a₀², most-probable r = a₀.  
→ identical.

(b)  
• Candidate 1: a single numerical value 1.76 × 10⁻¹⁴.  
• Candidate 2: symbolic expression 4 Rₙ³ / (3 a₀³).  

These are not the same object; equality would require specifying the same Rₙ and getting exactly the same number. Since the numerical value depends on an unspecified Rₙ, the two answers are not exactly identical. Hence sub-answer (b) differs.

(c)  
Although the kinetic-energy expectation values match, the momentum-space wave-functions are written in different forms and contain different overall constants (and one uses k while the other uses p); they are not manifestly identical without extra justification.

Because at least one required sub-answer (b) is not identical (Rule 2) the two candidate responses are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for several distinct numerical/analytical results in parts (a), (b) and (c).  
Comparing each required item:

Part (a)  
• ⟨r⟩: both give 3/2 a₀  → same  
• ⟨r²⟩: Candidate 1 gives 3 a₀², Candidate 2 gives 5/2 a₀² → different  
• Most-probable r: both give a₀ → same  
Because one of the three required values differs, the two sets are not identical (Rule 2).

Part (b)  
• Probability in nucleus: Candidate 1 gives a fixed number 1.76 × 10⁻¹⁴, Candidate 2 gives the symbolic expression 4Rₙᵤc³/(3a₀³); they are not the same value or form → different.

Part (c)  
• Momentum-space wave-function: functional forms differ; Candidate 1 has a (1 + k²a₀²)⁻² factor, Candidate 2 has (1 + a₀²p²)⁻³ᐟ² and coefficients also differ → different.  
• ⟨T⟩: both give 13.6 eV (Candidate 1 in formula form, Candidate 2 numerically), but other required answer (the wave-function) already disagrees, so overall part (c) not identical.

Since at least one required answer in each part differs, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 1: W = (e² |A₀|² (k′·p_if)²)/(ħ² m² c²) · ρ(E)

Candidate 2: Γ = (e² ω |A₀|²)/(2π ħ² c²) |⟨f|r|i⟩|² ρ(E_f)

Major discrepancies:

1. Candidate 1 contains (k′·p_if)²/m²; Candidate 2 contains |⟨f|r|i⟩|² with no m⁻² factor.
2. Candidate 2 has an extra ω/(2π) factor that Candidate 1 lacks.
3. Candidate 1 depends on k′·p_if, whereas Candidate 2 depends on the dipole matrix element ⟨r⟩.
4. Candidate 1 does not include the 2π/ħ prefactor expected from Fermi’s Golden Rule, whereas Candidate 2 includes 1/(2π).

Because of these unequal factors and differing matrix elements, the two expressions are not equivalent by any straightforward unit or identity conversion under the given assumptions.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions for the ionization rate are visibly different.

• Candidate 1:  W = (e² |A₀|² / ħ² m² c²) ( k′ · p_if )² ρ(E)

• Candidate 2:  Γ = (e² ω |A₀|² / (π ħ² c²)) |⟨f| r |i⟩|² ρ(E_f)

Key discrepancies:

1. Candidate 1 involves (k′ · p_if)², whereas Candidate 2 involves |⟨f| r |i⟩|².
2. Candidate 2 carries an explicit factor ω/π, while Candidate 1 has no ω or π outside the matrix‐element term.
3. Even after relating p_if to r_if (p_if = i m ω r_if) and substituting k′ = ω/c, Candidate 1 acquires extra factors (ω³ / c²) and an angular factor cos²θ that are not present in Candidate 2.

Because their functional dependence and overall numerical factors differ, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions for every required sub-answer:

1. Hamiltonian: Candidate 1 uses a σₓ matrix and no explicit ħ; Candidate 2 uses σ_z and includes ħ.  
2. Spinor χ(t): Candidate 1 contains γ in the phase, Candidate 2 does not, and the phase signs differ.  
3. Probability: the arguments differ by a factor γ.  
4. Minimum B₀: Candidate 1 gives π ω/γ, Candidate 2 gives π ω.

Since at least one discrepancy exists for each part, the answers are not equivalent.
We must compare the four sub-answers (a)–(d).

(a)  Hamiltonian matrices  
 • Candidate 1: proportional to σ_x  
 • Candidate 2: proportional to σ_z  
 These are different matrices unless one explicitly states a change of basis.  No such statement is given.  Not equivalent.

(b)  Spinor χ(t)  
 The two forms differ only by an overall sign in the constant θ, which produces the same phases (because γ = −g_s μ_B/ħ).  They are effectively the same, but this does not rescue the mismatch in (a).

(c)  Probability P_–(x)(t)  
 Expressions are identical up to the sign of the coefficient, and the sine-square eliminates that sign, so (c) matches.

(d)  Minimum B₀  
 • Candidate 1: B₀ ≥ π ω/γ (γ is negative for an electron → right-hand side negative).  
 • Candidate 2: B₀ = πħω/(g_s μ_B) (positive quantity).  
 Signs differ, so they do not match.

Because at least one sub-answer ((a) and (d)) is different, the two candidates are not equivalent under Rule 2.

The question has three sub-parts.

(a) Both candidates give exactly the same eigenfunctions and eigenvalues.

(b) Both candidates give algebraically identical first-order shifts:
 Candidate 1 ΔEₙ = (2ε/π)[1 + 1/(4n²–1)]
 Candidate 2 ΔEₙ = 8 ε n² / [π(4n²–1)]
These expressions are the same after simplification, so part (b) matches.

(c) The probabilities are required for the first and second excited states.

• For the first excited state, Candidate 2 provides a definite expression
  | –16λb/(9π²ħ)[…] |².
  Candidate 1 only states
  P₁→₂(t) ∝ | sin[(ω₂₁–ω)t/2] …|
  and the formula is cut off; the proportionality constant and the full expression are missing.  
  Because Candidate 1’s answer is incomplete/vague, we cannot verify equality with Candidate 2’s explicit formula.

• Both say the probability for the second excited state is zero, but the mismatch for the first excited state is enough to make the overall answers different.

Under Rule 2 (all parts must match) and Rule 8 (incomplete answer counts as different), the two candidates are NOT equivalent.

Both candidates answer all three sub-parts, but they differ in the set of equations required in part (b).  
• Candidate 1 writes  
 i f₁″ = 2 f₀′ f₂′ + (f₁′)²  
whereas the question (and Candidate 2) has  
 i f₁″ = 2 f₀′ f₁′ + (f₁′)².  

Because this third equation is wrong in Candidate 1 and correct in Candidate 2, the two responses are not identical across all required answers.

Candidate 2 reproduces all three differential relations required in part (b) exactly as stated in the problem:
• (f₀′)² = p²  
• i f₀″ = 2 f₀′ f₁′  
• i f₁″ = 2 f₀′ f₁′ + (f₁′)²  

Candidate 1 gives the first two correctly, but for the third writes  
i f₁″ = 2 f₀′ f₂′ + (f₁′)²,  
introducing f₂′ instead of f₁′, which is not what the question asks for.

Since one of the required relations is different, the two sets of answers are not identical. Under Rule 2 (all required components must match), the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different expressions for every sub-part of the problem.  
(a) Their formulas for B differ by a relativistic γ-factor.  
(b) Their expressions for u′₀ are not the same (Candidate 1 even makes it time-dependent, Candidate 2 does not).  
(c) Candidate 1 gets a non-zero derivative, Candidate 2 says it is zero.  

Since at least one answer in each sub-problem differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).
The problem asks for three specific results (parts (a), (b), (c)).  
Comparing the two candidates:

Part (a):

• Candidate 2: \(B=\dfrac{m\omega}{q}\)

These are not the same expression (Candidate 1 has an extra relativistic factor).  
Because one sub-answer already disagrees, the full sets of answers cannot be equivalent (Rule 2).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question effectively requires three characteristic frequencies.  

Candidate 2 supplies exactly three:  
1) ω₀  
2) ω₊ = ½(√(ω_c²+4ω₀²)+ω_c)  
3) ω₋ = ½(√(ω_c²+4ω₀²)−ω_c)

(where ω_c = eB/m).

Candidate 1 lists seven “answers.”  Among them are the same three expressions (ω₀, ω₊, ω₋) that Candidate 2 gives, but Candidate 1 also adds further formulas:

• “ω₊ = ω₀ + eB/2m”  
• “ω₋ = ω₀ − eB/2m”  
• “ω₊ = eB/m + mω₀²/(eB)”  
• “ω₋ = mω₀²/(eB)”

These extra expressions are only weak- or strong-field approximations and are not identical to the exact formulas supplied earlier; taken at face value they contradict the exact expressions for general field strength. Hence Candidate 1’s full set of “answers” cannot be simultaneously correct for all situations, while Candidate 2 presents only the exact results.

Because Candidate 1 supplies additional, generally incorrect (or at least condition-dependent) formulas, the two candidates’ predictions are not the same.

• Only Candidate 1 also supplies the limiting-field expressions (weak: ω₀ ± ω_c/2, strong: ω_c + mω₀²/(eB) and mω₀²/(eB)).

The problem requests both the normal-mode displacement patterns and their corresponding frequencies.  

• Candidate 1 supplies three frequencies (0, √(k/m), √(3k/m)) and, crucially, also lists the associated normal-mode coordinate relations (x₁, x₂, x₃ patterns).  
• Candidate 2 lists only the three frequencies and omits the normal-mode patterns.  

Because Candidate 2 does not furnish all elements required by the question, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates list three normal-mode frequencies  
ω₁ = 0 ,  ω₂ = √(k/m) ,  ω₃ = √(3k/m).

For the associated mode shapes:

• ω₁ : Candidate 1 has all masses moving together (x₁ = x₂ = x₃), which is exactly Candidate 2’s description “all particles move together”.

• ω₂ : Candidate 1 shows the two outer masses moving oppositely while the central one is at rest (x₁ = –x₃ , x₂ = 0). Candidate 2 states “particles 1 and 2 move in opposite directions”, clearly referring to the two masses attached by the springs to the third (central) mass, i.e. the same pattern; the central mass is implicitly stationary. This is consistent, not contradictory.

• ω₃ : Candidate 1 has the outer masses in phase and the central mass moving oppositely with twice the amplitude (x₁ = x₃ , x₂ = –2x₁). Candidate 2 says “particles 1 and 2 move in phase, particle 3 moves oppositely”, which matches the same relative directions (amplitude ratio left unspecified). Hence they describe the same mode.

Thus the two candidates supply the same set of frequencies and compatible normal-mode patterns. They are equivalent.
The two candidates list three normal-mode frequencies.  
Candidate 1 gives the set {0, √(k/m), √(3k/m)}, whereas Candidate 2 gives {0, √(k/m), √(2k/m)}.  
Because √(3k/m) ≠ √(2k/m), at least one frequency is different, so the answers are not the same.

The problem has three sub-parts, so each candidate must supply three matching numerical answers.

Sub-answer (a) – minimum density  
• Candidate 1: 1.3 × 10¹⁴ kg m⁻³ (interpreted as 1.30000 × 10¹⁴)  
• Candidate 2: 1.27 × 10¹⁴ kg m⁻³ (1.27000 × 10¹⁴)  
Difference already at the 3rd significant digit ⇒ not equal to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Sub-answer (b) – maximum radius  
• Candidate 1: ≤ 150 km  
• Candidate 2: ≈ 1.55 × 10⁵ m = 155 km  
150 km vs 155 km differ, and one is an inequality; not identical.

Sub-answer (c) – radius at nuclear density  
• Candidate 1: 17 km  
• Candidate 2: 12.7 km  
Different values.

Since at least one (actually all three) sub-answers differ, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 supplies both required parts for sub-problem (a) (equilibrium position and period), while Candidate 1 gives only the period and omits the equilibrium position.  

For sub-problem (b) the three required velocity ranges are clearly stated and mutually exclusive in Candidate 2. Candidate 1 lists three separate inequalities but does not indicate which corresponds to which physical case; moreover, it never gives a negative-velocity bound for escape to −∞ (Candidate 2 has v < −√(c/ma)). Thus the two sets of answers do not match.

Because Candidate 1 is missing a required answer and the remaining answers are not the same as Candidate 2’s, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the potential energy in the form −(constant)/r².

Let

L = angular-momentum magnitude of the particle  
h = r² θ̇  (the usual “specific angular momentum,” i.e. angular momentum per unit mass)

Then L = m h.

Candidate 1: V(r) = − m h² / (2 r²)  
      = − m  (L² / m²) / (2 r²)  
      = − L² / (2 m r²).

Candidate 2: V(r) = − L² / (2 m r²).

Thus, after recognizing that h and L differ only by the factor m, the two expressions are identical.

Candidate 1 states that the photographed object “appears as a sphere.”  
Candidate 2 states that the photographed object is “a circle with radius \(R_0\).”

A sphere (a 3-D object) and a circle (a 2-D image with specified radius) are not the same description.  
Candidate 2 also specifies the radius \(R_0\), while Candidate 1 gives no size information at all. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single number (the radius r in cm).  
Both candidates give numerical answers in the same unit (cm).

Candidate 1: 5.97 × 10⁻⁵ cm  
Candidate 2: 1.193 × 10⁻⁴ cm

Convert to the same exponent for strict comparison (rule 4):

Candidate 1 → 5.97000 × 10⁻⁵  
Candidate 2 → 11.9300 × 10⁻⁵

They differ already in the first significant digit and therefore do not match to six significant digits. Hence, the two predictions are not equivalent.
The two answers are real numbers expressed in the same unit (cm).  
To check equivalence we compare them to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

Candidate 1: 5.97000 × 10⁻⁵ cm  
Candidate 2: 1.19200 × 10⁻⁴ cm

Even after expressing both with the same exponent (e.g., 5.97000 × 10⁻⁵ cm vs. 11.9200 × 10⁻⁵ cm), the first six significant digits differ (5.97000 vs. 11.9200). Hence the two values are not the same.

The task asks for several separate results (position-4-vector transformation, momentum-4-vector transformation, and three Doppler formulas).  
Both candidates give the three Doppler formulas identically, and their momentum-4-vector transformations are the same after accounting for the factor of c.

However, their Lorentz transformations for the position 4-vector are written in different forms:

• Candidate 2 writes the usual “forward” transformation  
 x′ = γ(x – vt), t′ = γ(t – vx/c²), … (primed expressed in terms of unprimed).

• Candidate 1 supplies a matrix that yields  
 x = γ x′ – βγ ct′, ct = –βγ x′ + γ ct′, … (unprimed expressed in terms of primed) and also uses a different component ordering (x,y,z,ct instead of ct,x,y,z).

Thus, although the two sets of equations describe inverse relations, they are not written in the same form, nor do they match component ordering. Because at least one required sub-answer is not identical between the two candidates, Rule 2 says the total answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions are different: Candidate 1 has y proportional to (R – x)², whereas Candidate 2 has y proportional to x².

The problem has three sub-questions, so each candidate must supply three corresponding answers.

Sub-answer (a):
• Candidate 1: Mₑ = g R² / G  
• Candidate 2: Mₑ = g R² / G  
→ identical.

Sub-answer (b):
• Candidate 1: G (Mₘ + Mₑ) = 4 π a³ / T²  (⇒ Mₘ = 4 π a³ / (G T²) – Mₑ)  
• Candidate 2: Mₘ = 4 π² d³ / (G T²) – Mₑ  
The numerical factor differs: 4 π versus 4 π². Not the same.

Sub-answer (c):
• Candidate 1 gives a complicated parallax-based expression, not reducible to Candidate 2’s simple Kepler formula a = [G Mₛ T² / (4 π²)]^{1/3}.  
→ different formulas.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, Rule 2 says the overall answers are not equivalent.

The question requires three distinct pieces of information:

1. The full set of differential equations for the four-velocity.
2. The three exponential exponents (eigenvalues).
3. The condition on E and B for bounded motion.

Comparison of the two candidates:

• Differential equations  
  – Candidate 1: gives none.  
  – Candidate 2: supplies all four required equations.  
  → Already inequivalent because Candidate 1 omits a required answer.

• Exponents  
  – Candidate 1: λ = 0, ±(e/mc)√(a² − c²b²).  
  – Candidate 2: λ = 0, ±(e/m)√(a² − b²).  
  These differ by factors of c both outside and inside the square root, so they are not the same even if units were chosen consistently.

• Bounded-motion condition  
  – Candidate 1: a ≤ cb (|E| ≤ c|B|).  
  – Candidate 2: |a| < |b| (|E| < |B|).  
  These are plainly different.

Because (i) Candidate 1 is missing the differential equations entirely, and (ii) the given eigenvalues and boundedness conditions do not match those of Candidate 2, the two answers are not equivalent.

2. Pulses received during outgoing leg:  
 • Candidate 1: t₁ √[(1 − β)/(1 + β)]  
 • Candidate 2: t₁ / (1 + β)  
 These two expressions are not equal for general β (√[(1−β)/(1+β)] ≠ 1/(1+β)).

• Candidate 1 gives  
  – a magnitude formula \(v'\) and  
  – an angle formula \(\tan\varphi' = v\sin\varphi\sqrt{1-u^{2}/c^{2}}\) (which lacks the necessary denominator and is therefore incomplete or incorrect).

• Candidate 2 provides velocity components that imply a different magnitude formula and states  
  \(\tan\varphi' = \dfrac{v\sin\varphi}{\gamma\,(v\cos\varphi - u)}\) with \(\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-u^{2}/c^{2}}\).

The two expressions for \(\tan\varphi'\) are clearly not the same, so the overall answers differ.

The question has four sub-parts and therefore requires agreement on four distinct answers:  

1. Impact velocity \(V_0\)  
2. Time of fall \(t\)  
3. Velocity-versus-depth expression and numerical depth when \(V=V_0/10\)  
4. Depth-versus-time expression \(x(t)\)

Comparison:

(a) Impact velocity  
• Candidate 1: 14 m/s  
• Candidate 2: 14.01 m/s  
To six significant digits these are 14.0000 and 14.0100, which are different.  
Time value (1.43 s) matches, but both quantities for this sub-part must agree; they do not.

(b) Velocity-depth formula: both give \(V=V_0 e^{-(b/m)x}\) (match).

(c) Depth for \(V=V_0/10\): both give 5.76 m (match).

(d) Depth-time relation: both give \(x=\frac{m}{b}\ln\!\left(1+\frac{bV_0}{m}t\right)\) (match).

Because the answers disagree on the required value of \(V_0\) in part (a), Rule 2 dictates the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

This has the dimension of 1/time (each square-root term is an angular frequency).

Candidate 2 gives  
ωₚ = 4 A R³ / (G M m)

The combination 4 A R³ / (G M m) is dimensionless because
A has units M T⁻², R³ has L³, and G M m has L³ M T⁻², so everything cancels.

Expressed with six significant digits these are 1.45000 ×10² MeV and 1.44700 ×10² MeV, which differ in the third significant digit. Hence they are not equal by Rule 4.

With six significant digits these become 6.78700 ×10¹⁰ GeV and 6.79000 ×10¹⁰ GeV—also different in the third significant digit, so they do not match either.

Part (c) The qualitative comments are not identical: Candidate 1 predicts depletion of protons above the threshold, whereas Candidate 2 says the interaction is rare and does not strongly affect the spectrum.

The only difference is that Candidate 1 writes an explicit “c²” factor while Candidate 2 omits it, implicitly using natural units (c = 1) that the problem statement already employs (it writes m_t = 2 m_W with no c²). Thus the two expressions represent the same energy.

The question also asks whether the situation is kinematically possible. Candidate 2 explicitly says “Yes,” while Candidate 1 implicitly affirms this by supplying the required energy value (which would only be relevant if the answer were “Yes”). Because both answers convey the same substantive information—“Yes, and E = 5/4 m_t”—they are considered equivalent.

The question asks for a single quantity: “the minimum number of times the rope must wind around the pole.”  
• Candidate 2 gives that single quantity:  α / (2π μ).  
• Candidate 1 states an inequality: n_wind ≥ α / (2π μ).  This describes a whole set of acceptable values (anything at or above the threshold) rather than specifying the minimum itself.

Because “≥” is strictly weaker than “=” in this context, the two answers are not mathematically identical—the first allows larger values, the second fixes the exact minimum. Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same critical expression, α / (2 π μ).  
Candidate 1 phrases it as an inequality “n ≥ α/(2πμ)”, while Candidate 2 just states the value. Since the minimum number of windings is exactly that value—and saying “n must be at least this value” communicates the same requirement—the two answers are effectively the same.

The question has two sub-parts.  
Both candidates answer both (a) and (b).

Part (a):  
• C1 gives D = (1/3) v λ.  
• C2 gives D ≈ v λ.  
These differ by a factor of 3; whether that is acceptable is unclear, but we still must check part (b).

Part (b): numeric value of D:  
• C1: 3.1 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s  
• C2: 3.0 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s  

Per Rule 4, numerical answers must match to 6 significant digits.  
3.10000 × 10⁻⁵ ≠ 3.00000 × 10⁻⁵.

Because at least one required sub-answer (the numeric value) differs, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 supplies answers for both sub-parts (a) and (b), whereas Candidate 2 gives only the entropy formula for part (b) and says nothing about part (a).  
Because the original question requires answers to both sub-problems, and Candidate 2 omits one of them, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2), even though their entropy formulas in part (b) are algebraically the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

Both candidates supply answers for each requested sub-problem:

(a) 
• maximum non-equilibrium energy per atom  = ε  
• maximum equilibrium energy per atom       = ε/2  
The two candidates give identical values.

(b)  
Let y = E/(Nε).  

Candidate 1:  S/N = k [ y ln(1/y) + (1–y) ln(1/(1–y)) ]  
              = –k [ y ln y + (1–y) ln(1–y) ]

Candidate 2:  S/N = k [ ln(ε / (ε–E/N)) + (E/N)/ε · ln((ε–E/N)/(E/N)) ]  
              = –k [ y ln y + (1–y) ln(1–y) ]

Thus the entropy formulas are algebraically the same.  
All parts match exactly; no omissions or unit issues arise.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

Candidate 1 explicitly writes the requested formula for ΔS.

Candidate 2 merely says “The change in entropy of the bar is given by the provided expression…”, without actually writing that expression.  Thus Candidate 2 does not present the explicit result; it gives only a descriptive reference.  Under Rule 6, an answer that does not explicitly state the required quantity is not a conclusive answer.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: p₁(t) = p₀ e^{−Avt/(4V)}

Apart from t = 0, the expressions differ (e.g., for any positive t, (1/2)(1+e^{−k}) ≠ e^{−k/2} in general). Thus the candidates give inequivalent answers.

The question has three sub-parts (a), (b), (c).  
For equivalence, each corresponding sub-answer must convey essentially the same information.

(a) Both candidates say the temperature rise is due to ozone absorbing ultraviolet radiation → equivalent.

(b) Candidate 1: “Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation and carbon dioxide emits infrared radiation, maintaining an energy equilibrium.”  
Candidate 2: “Absorbed UV continuously heats it, and the temperature inversion suppresses vertical mixing, preventing heat from escaping.”  
These explanations are different. Candidate 1 stresses radiative balance (ozone + CO₂) and does not mention the dynamical stability/inhibition of mixing; Candidate 2’s key point is the suppression of vertical mixing by the temperature inversion and does not mention CO₂. Thus the sub-answers are not the same.

(c) Both describe a temperature inversion acting as a waveguide that traps sound so intensity falls ~1/R → equivalent.

Because sub-answer (b) is not equivalent, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different numerical results for every part except the heat capacities, and for part (b) they even use different units (rad s⁻¹ vs m s⁻¹).

Reasoning:

The problem requests several separate items:
1. Boltzmann’s statistical definition of entropy (S = k ln Ω) with brief meaning.
2. ΔS of the two-level system.
3. ΔS of the reservoir.
4. The resulting ratio n₁/n₂.

Candidate 1 gives only items 2–4; it omits the required definition/meaning in item 1.  
Candidate 2 supplies all requested items, including the definition/meaning (item 1).

Because Candidate 1 fails to answer one of the required sub-questions, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question has three sub-parts requiring three answers.

Comparison of the sub-answers:

(a) Chemical-potential expressions  
 • Candidate 1 gives density formulas containing specific mass factors and an exponential with +E_d/kT.  
 • Candidate 2 gives μ = kT ln(n/n_Q)+μ₀ and states that excited states can be ignored.  
 → Forms and even the sign of the binding-energy term differ; not obviously identical.

(b) Equilibrium [e] expression  
 • Candidate 1:  [e] = √[H] (2πm_e kT/h²)^{3/2} exp(−E_d/2kT)  
 • Candidate 2:  [e] = √{[H] (n_Q_p n_Q_e / n_Q_H)} exp(−13.6 eV/kT)  
 → Different prefactors and exponent (full E_d vs E_d/2); not equivalent.

(c) Half-ionization density  
 • Candidate 1: n = 3.3 × 10¹⁶ m⁻³  
 • Candidate 2: n = 1.2 × 10¹⁰ m⁻³  
 → Values differ by six orders of magnitude.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two numerical results: the change in temperature and the change in pressure when the volume is reduced by 1 %. 

• Candidate 1 provides the final temperature (302 K) and final pressure (2.0 × 10⁵ N m⁻²), not the changes.  
  – Interpreting those finals relative to the given initial state (300 K, ≈1.87 × 10⁵ N m⁻²) would imply ΔT ≈ +2 K and ΔP ≈ +1.3 × 10⁴ Pa ≈ +0.13 atm.

• Candidate 2 explicitly gives ΔT = 1.40 K and ΔP = 0.0273 atm.

These changes differ significantly (≈2 K vs 1.40 K for temperature; ≈0.13 atm vs 0.027 atm for pressure). Therefore the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

Sub-answer (a):

Candidate 1’s main formula for C_vib is incomplete (missing the denominator (e^{θ/T}−1)^2). Candidate 2 gives the full expression k(θ/T)^2 e^{θ/T}/(e^{θ/T}−1)^2. Even ignoring the missing denominator, Candidate 1 uses R (molar units) while Candidate 2 uses k (per-molecule units), so the two answers are not the same. Hence the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the “general-T” formula as 

 C_v = R (θ/T)² e^{θ/T}

with no denominator.  
Candidate 2 gives 

 C_v = k θ² /[4 T² sinh²(θ/(2T))].

The two formulas are not the same (even after accounting for the molar vs molecular constant R = N_A k). Candidate 1’s expression is missing the crucial (e^{θ/T} − 1)² or equivalent sinh² denominator, so it is not mathematically equivalent to Candidate 2’s complete expression. Their high-T limits also differ by a factor of N_A (R vs k).

Therefore the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for two separate expressions (isothermal case and adiabatic case).  
Both candidates supply two expressions.

Using the ideal-gas relation \(p = \rho R T / M\):

• Candidate 2’s isothermal result  
 \(C = \sqrt{p/\rho} = \sqrt{(ρRT/M)/ρ} = \sqrt{RT/M}\),  
 which is exactly Candidate 1’s isothermal result.

• Candidate 2’s adiabatic result  
 \(C = \sqrt{\gamma p/\rho} = \sqrt{\gamma (ρRT/M)/ρ} = \sqrt{\gamma RT/M}\),  
 which is exactly Candidate 1’s adiabatic result.

Thus each corresponding pair of answers is mathematically identical, so the two candidates’ predictions are equivalent.

• Candidate 2 = 3.51456 × 10⁴ J = 35 145.6 J

Comparing digit-by-digit, they already differ in the third significant digit (0 vs 1).

The two candidates give numerical answers that can be compared after converting to the same unit.

• Candidate 1: 3.5 × 10⁴ J = 35 000 J

• Candidate 2: 8 420 cal  
 In joules: 8 420 cal × 4.184 J/cal ≈ 35 229 J.

The two values differ by about 229 J (≈0.65 %) or about 55 cal.  
According to Rule 4, they must match to 6 significant digits to be considered equivalent; 35 000 and 35 229 do not match at that precision.

Hence, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both sub-problems require explicit answers.

1.  For part (1)  
    • Candidate 1 supplies a piece-wise formula for B(M) (no λ in the first branch, units questionable).  
    • Candidate 2 supplies a single linear piece-wise-implicit formula for M(B) that contains λ.  
    The two expressions are clearly different objects (one is B(M), the other M(B)) and are not algebraic inverses of each other; they cannot both be true simultaneously.

2.  For part (2)  
    • Candidate 1 gives only some derivatives and an unexplained inequality; it never explicitly states the required convexity principle and does not discuss what would go wrong if the principle fails.  
    • Candidate 2 explicitly supplies (a) the principle, (b) checks the second derivative, and (c) discusses the consequences.

Because the answers disagree on part (1) and candidate 1 is incomplete for part (2), the two candidate outputs are not equivalent under Rule 2 (different or missing required answers).

Both parts must be compared.

Part (a):
• Candidate 1: v² = (∂p/∂ρ)_S  
• Candidate 2: v = √(∂p/∂ρ)_S  

These are the same physical relation; Candidate 1 gives the square of the speed, Candidate 2 gives the positive square root. They lead to the identical value for v.

Part (b):
Rewrite Candidate 1 with n = N/V and h = 2πħ:

v₁ = (1/√3)(h/m)(3n/8π)^{1/3}
    = (1/√3)(2πħ/m)(3n/8π)^{1/3}
    = (ħ/m)π^{2/3}3^{-1/6} n^{1/3}

Candidate 2: v₂ = (ħ/m)π^{2/3}3^{-1/6} n^{1/3}

Thus the two formulas are exactly the same.

Both sub-answers are therefore equivalent.

For T_R and T_V the numbers match exactly (75 K and 6250 K).

For the specific-heat values, however, Candidate 1 supplies rounded decimal numbers while Candidate 2 gives exact multiples of R.  Converting Candidate 2’s values to decimals (with R ≈ 8.314 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹) yields:

• T₄: 9/2 R ≈ 37.413 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹, whereas Candidate 1 lists 37.4 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹  

When compared to six significant digits as required by Rule 4, 12.4710 ≠ 12.5000 and 37.4130 ≠ 37.4000.  Because at least one pair of corresponding numbers differs at this precision, the two answer sets are not identical.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem requests four numerical answers.  
Comparing each sub-answer:

1. Heat at constant pressure:  
   Candidate 1 = 30 000 cal  
   Candidate 2 = 30 000 cal → identical.

2. Increase in internal energy:  
   Candidate 1 = 21 000 cal  
   Candidate 2 = 150 000/7 cal ≈ 21 428.6 cal.  
   The two numbers differ (2.10000 ×10⁴ vs 2.14286 ×10⁴); they do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4).

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 supplies explicit integral formulas, predicting for the massive Bose gas an energy density proportional to T^{5/2} and a heat-capacity proportional to T^{3/2}, and for the photon gas an energy ∝ T^{4}.  

Candidate 2 merely states that at very low temperature the energy is dominated by the ground state so the heat capacity vanishes, and that for photons the energy is ∝ T^{4}. It neither matches the T^{5/2} and T^{3/2} dependences nor provides the requested integral expressions.

Because the two sets of answers disagree on the temperature dependence and completeness of the required results, the candidates are not equivalent.

The problem asks for three distinct numerical answers.  
Both candidates provide three answers, but:

1. Energy expelled to the room  
   • Candidate 1: 1.78 × 10³ J/s = 1780 W  
   • Candidate 2: 1776 W  
   Difference ≈ 4 W; they do not match to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

2. Electrical power supplied  
   • Candidate 1: 0.18 kW = 180 W  
   • Candidate 2: 0.176 kW = 176 W  
   Values differ.

3. Coefficient of performance  
   • Candidate 1: 9.1  
   • Candidate 2: 10.1  
   Values differ.

Since at least one (in fact, all three) sub-answers disagree, the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).
The question asks for three numeric answers.  
Compare each pair from the two candidates:

1. Rate of energy expelled:  
   • C1: 1.78 × 10³ J/s = 1780 W  
   • C2: 1776 W  
   1780 W expressed to six significant digits is 1.78000 × 10³.  
   1776 W is 1.77600 × 10³.  
   They differ already in the third significant digit; therefore they are not equal to six-digit precision.

2. Electrical power required:  
   • C1: 0.18 kW = 180 W  
   • C2: 0.176 kW = 176 W  
   180 W vs 176 W likewise differ beyond the sixth significant digit comparison.

3. Coefficient of performance:  
   • C1: 9.1  
   • C2: 10.105  
   Clearly different.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, according to Rule 2 the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts; both candidates attempt to answer all three.  
Compare each sub-answer:

(a)  Candidate 1 supplies only “Δp ∝ 1/V²”, while Candidate 2 gives a full qualitative explanation.  The contents are clearly different.

(b)  Candidate 1:  ΔF = −kT ln[(V₂−b)/(V₁−b)] + a(1/V₁ − 1/V₂)  
     Candidate 2:  ΔF =  +RT ln[(V₂−b)/(V₁−b)] + a(1/V₂ − 1/V₁)

     Signs of both terms are opposite, and kT versus RT introduces an N_A factor.  The formulas are not the same.

(c)  Both give ΔU = a(1/V₁ − 1/V₂), but because (a) and (b) differ, the overall sets of answers are not identical.

Under Rule 2, since at least one sub-answer differs, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two formulas differ in their numerical factors and in whether the permittivity ε₀ appears explicitly. Even after accounting for unit-system conventions (e.g., ε₀ = 1 in Gaussian units), the factors do not match: one gives φ²/(4π r²) while the other gives ε₀ φ²/(2 r²). Consequently, the two candidates are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives: Δp = φ² / (4 π r²)

Candidate 2 gives: Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)

Taking the ratio of the two expressions (assuming the same units for φ):

(ε₀ φ² / 2 r²) ÷ (φ² / 4 π r²) = (ε₀ / 2) · (4 π) = 2 π ε₀ ≈ 5.6 × 10⁻¹¹ ≠ 1.

Thus, with the same system of units the two formulas are numerically different.  
Although one formula contains ε₀ and the other contains 4 π, they are not equivalent unless further unit-conversion factors for the potential are introduced; the problem statement does not indicate such a change of units. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives  
 Δp = φ² / (4π r²)

Candidate 2 gives  
 Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)

In SI units ε₀ ≈ 8.85 × 10⁻¹² F m⁻¹; therefore ε₀/2 ≈ 4.43 × 10⁻¹², whereas 1/(4π) ≈ 7.96 × 10⁻². The numerical factors (and included constants) are totally different, so the two expressions are not equivalent.

The two formulas are not mathematically identical in general:

• Candidate 1:  R₁ = x [2 + (α₁ + α₂) ΔT] / [4 (α₂ − α₁) ΔT]  
• Candidate 2:  R₂ = x / [2 (α₂ − α₁) ΔT]

Taking the ratio,

R₁ / R₂ = (2 + (α₁ + α₂) ΔT) / 2.

For the two expressions to be equal, we would need (2 + (α₁ + α₂) ΔT) / 2 = 1 ⇒ (α₁ + α₂) ΔT = 0, which is not satisfied for a non-zero temperature change. Hence the candidates give different radii of curvature.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not mathematically the same:

Candidate 1: R₁ = (x/4)·[2 + (α₁ + α₂)ΔT] / [(α₂ − α₁)ΔT]

Candidate 2: R₂ = x / [(α₂ − α₁)ΔT]

The ratio R₁ / R₂ = ¼ · [2 + (α₁ + α₂)ΔT].  
This equals 1 only if 2 + (α₁ + α₂)ΔT = 4, which is not generally true. Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different algebraic expressions for R:  

Candidate 1: R = (x/4)·[2 + (α₁ + α₂) ΔT] / [(α₂ − α₁) ΔT]  
Candidate 2: R = x / [(α₂ − α₁) ΔT]

For the two to be identical we would need (x/4)[2 + (α₁ + α₂)ΔT] = x, which would require 2 + (α₁ + α₂)ΔT = 4, a condition that is not generally true. Thus the formulas are not the same.

The problem asks for two separate answers.  
Both candidates give an answer for (a) and (b), so we must compare each sub-answer.

(a) Spectral energy density

• Candidate 1:  (ħ / π² c³) ω³ dω / [e^{ħω / (2π kT)} – 1]  
• Candidate 2:  (8π h / c³) ω³ / [e^{hω / kT} – 1]

To see if they can be the same, note h = 2πħ.

– Exponential factor:  
  Candidate 1 exponent = ħω / (2πkT) = hω / (4π²kT).  
  Candidate 2 exponent = hω / (kT).  
  These differ by a factor 4π² in the denominator; hence not the same.

– Prefactor:  
  Candidate 1: h/(2π³c³).  
  Candidate 2: 8πh/c³.  
  The ratio of the two prefactors is 16π⁴, so they are clearly different.

Thus the two expressions in (a) are not equivalent.

(b) Total energy density ∝ T⁴  
Both candidates give the same qualitative dependence, but because part (a) already disagrees and the question requires both parts to be answered, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem requires two answers, (a) and (b).  
• For part (b) both candidates give the same temperature dependence, T⁴.  
• For part (a) the formulae differ:

Candidate 1:  (ħ / π²c³) ω³ dω / [exp(ħω / 2πkT) − 1]  
Candidate 2:  (8πħ ω³ / c³) / [exp(ħω / kT) − 1]

These expressions are not the same:
– The exponential arguments differ by a factor of 2π.  
– The overall prefactors differ (ħ/π² vs 8πħ).  

Since one of the required sub-answers is different, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The problem asks for several specific numerical quantities (heat of vaporization, enthalpy of water, Gibbs functions for water and for steam) plus a proof statement.

1. Part (a):  
   • Candidate 1: 540 cal/g  
   • Candidate 2: 540.85 cal/g  
   To six significant digits these are 5.40000 × 10² and 5.40850 × 10² – they differ.

2. Part (b):  
   • Candidate 1: 100 cal/g  
   • Candidate 2: 99.15 cal/g  
   These are different.

3. Part (c): both candidates give numerical values for G of water and steam; they differ as well.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs between the candidates (indeed several do), the two overall predictions are not equivalent under Rule 2 (all sub-answers must match) and Rule 4 (numerical equality to six significant digits).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 must be compared for every requested sub-answer (a)–(d).

Sub-answer (a):  
• C1: 540 cal/g  
• C2: 541.07 cal/g  
Values differ by ~1 cal/g and are not identical to 6 significant digits ⇒ not equivalent.

Sub-answer (b): 100 cal/g vs 99 cal/g ⇒ different.

Sub-answer (c):  
• Water: –16 cal/g vs –16.68 cal/g ⇒ different.  
• Steam: –16 cal/g vs –16.74 cal/g ⇒ different.

Sub-answer (d): C1 gives no proof, C2 supplies a proof ⇒ C1 is incomplete.

Because at least one required answer differs and C1 omits part (d), the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 4).

   • C2: 2.3 × 10⁸⁷  
   Same units (count). 2.50000 vs 2.30000 differ in the first digit → not equal to 6 significant digits.

2. Photon energy content  
   • C1: 2.6 × 10⁷² erg  
   • C2: 2.6 × 10⁶⁵ J → 2.6 × 10⁶⁵ J × 10⁷ erg/J = 2.6 × 10⁷² erg  
   These are identical.

3. Electron Fermi momentum  
   • C1: 2 × 10⁻²⁶ g cm/s → 2 × 10⁻²⁶ × 10⁻⁵ = 2 × 10⁻³¹ kg m/s  
   • C2: 9.4 × 10⁻³⁴ kg m/s  
   2 × 10⁻³¹ vs 9.4 × 10⁻³⁴ differ by ~2 × 10²→ not equal.

The problem has two sub-parts, and each candidate supplies an answer for both.

Sub-part (a) – analytic expression  
• Candidate 1: n = (1/π²)(kBT/ħc)³ I  
→ rewriting with h (ħ = h/2π) gives n = (8π I)(kBT)³/(h³c³).  

• Candidate 2: n = (16π)(kBT)³/(h³c³) ∫₀^∞ x²/(e^x−1) dx.  

If Candidate 1’s I is the same integral that Candidate 2 writes explicitly, Candidate 1’s coefficient is 8π whereas Candidate 2’s coefficient is 16π – a factor-of-2 discrepancy. Nothing in Candidate 1’s answer indicates I is defined to absorb that extra factor, so the two analytic formulas are different.

Sub-part (b) – numerical estimate  
1000 cm⁻³ (Candidate 1) = 1 × 10⁹ m⁻³, which is essentially the same as 1.1 × 10⁹ m⁻³ (Candidate 2).  
This part matches.

Because the responses for sub-part (a) are not the same, the overall answers are not equivalent under Rule 2.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each give two required limits (high-T and low-T).  

High-T limit: both give C ≈ N k_B → identical.  

Low-T limit:  
• Candidate 1: C ≈ (π²/3) N k_B T / Θ_D  
• Candidate 2: C ≈ (π²/6) N k_B² T / ω  

These differ in numerical coefficient (π²/3 vs π²/6), in the presence of an extra factor k_B, and in replacing Θ_D by ω (also missing ħ). Hence the low-T expressions are not the same. Because at least one of the required sub-answers differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for several distinct items:  

(a) the “low-temperature” condition,  
(b) the average energy E(T),  
(c) the specific-heat expression/behaviour.  

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give:

a) Low-T condition  
 • Cand 1: T_c ≈ 10 ε/[k ln N]  
 • Cand 2: T ≪ 9 ε/k  
 These are plainly different statements; no simple unit conversion reconciles them.

b) Average energy  
 Both provide exactly the same formula.

c) Specific heat  
 • Cand 1 supplies an explicit formula plus two asymptotic expressions.  
 • Cand 2 gives only a qualitative description of two peaks; no explicit formula.  
 The answers are therefore not identical.

Because at least one required sub-answer (the low-temperature criterion) differs, and the Cv parts are not the same, the two candidates are not equivalent under Rule 2 (all sub-answers must match).

The problem has three sub-parts, so each candidate must provide three corresponding answers.  
Comparing the two candidates:

(a) Candidate 1 gives only the mathematical occupation-number formulas; Candidate 2 gives only a qualitative description (antisymmetry, Pauli principle, etc.).  The two answers are clearly not identical in content.

(b) Candidate 1’s “high-temperature” condition is T ≫ n^{2/3} h²/(2π m k).  Candidate 2 uses kT ≫ E_F or λ ≪ d.  Although physically related, they are expressed differently and are not identical.

(c) Candidate 1 states the quantum-statistics range as T ≲ 10^{−2} K (≈0.01 K).  
Candidate 2 gives “much lower than ~0.03 K.”  Numerically these differ by a factor of about 3, and per Rule 4 they are not the same to six significant digits.

Since at least one sub-answer in each part differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers for the two requested items.

Part (a):  
• C1 gives ⟨r′|ρ|r⟩ and ⟨p′|ρ|p⟩.  
• C2 gives ρ(x1,x2)=⟨x1|ρ|x2⟩ and φ(p1,p2)=⟨p1|ρ|p2⟩.  
These are the same definitions (different letters only).

Part (b):  
Both candidates state that ρ(x,x) ‒ the diagonal element in position space ‒ is a constant independent of x.  
• C1 writes ρ(r,r)= (1/V) Σp f(p).  
• C2 writes ρ(x,x)= (1/(2π)^2) ∫dp f(p).

These two expressions are the customary discrete-sum and continuum-integral versions of the same result; using the standard relation Σp … = (V/(2π)^d)∫dp … converts one to the other. Hence they are mathematically equivalent and both satisfy the requirement (“constant”).

Therefore, the two candidates give equivalent answers to every sub-question.

The question has two sub-parts.  
• Part (a) requires (i) the number of states as a function of Mₛ and (ii) the value of Mₛ giving the maximum.  
• Part (b) requires a definition of absolute zero, an explanation of negative absolute temperature, and an example.

Candidate 1 supplies only “Mₛ = 0,” covering only one item (ii) of part (a) and omitting the required formula for the number of states and all of part (b).  
Candidate 2 supplies the required formula, the same maximal value Mₛ = 0, and answers part (b).

Because Candidate 1 is incomplete whereas Candidate 2 is complete, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question requires explicit answers to seven separate quantities (a, b, c-i, c-ii, c-iii, c-iv, c-v).  

Comparison of the two candidates:

1. Part (a) (two-level contribution): Both give the same algebraic expression (apart from the absence/presence of the Boltzmann constant k, which they both omit in this part). So they match here.

2. Part (b) (translational contribution):  
   • Candidate 1: \(C_{V,\text{trans}}=\frac{3}{2}N\) (no k).  
   • Candidate 2: \(C_{V,\text{trans}}=\frac{3}{2}Nk\).  
   These differ by a factor of k; no unit conversion or convention stated resolves the mismatch. They are inequivalent.

3. Parts (c-i) through (c-v):  
   • Candidate 1 gives either incorrect formulas (e.g., \(\mu=\tau\log(n_QZ_{\text{int}})\)) or text that is cut off/incomplete for F, S, etc.  
   • Candidate 2 supplies complete, explicit expressions for all required thermodynamic quantities.

Because at least one sub-answer differs (and several of Candidate 1’s answers are incomplete or wrong), the two sets of predictions are not identical.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates provide values for all five items, but the numerical figures must match to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Comparison of each corresponding value:

1. Heat loss  
   • Candidate 1: 114 → 114.000 (assumed)  
   • Candidate 2: 114.4 → 114.400  
   The values differ at the third decimal place; not identical to 6 significant digits.

Because at least one required answer differs, the two submissions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same partition-function expression.

For the large-ε/τ limit of the average number of open links:

• Candidate 1: ⟨n⟩ ≈ 1/(e^{ε/τ} – 1)
• Candidate 2: ⟨n⟩ ≈ e^{–ε/τ}

In the limit ε ≫ τ, 1/(e^{ε/τ} – 1) → e^{–ε/τ}; thus Candidate 1’s form and Candidate 2’s form coincide in that limit.  
Since the question explicitly asks for the behavior in this limit, the two answers are effectively the same.

The two expressions for the final temperature are not the same:

• Candidate 1 effectively gives  
 τ_f = ( τ_i^3 − (5 / 8 π²) (N_s/N_p) μ² B² τ_D³ / τ_i² )^{1/3}.

• Candidate 2 gives  
 τ_f = ( τ^3 − (5 / 8 π⁴) (N_s/N_p) μ² B² τ_D³ / τ² )^{1/3}.

The coefficients differ by a factor of π² (π² vs π⁴), so the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give:

1. Equation of state  
   • Candidate 1: P = NkT / V  →  PV = NkT  
   • Candidate 2: PV = NkT  
   (mathematically the same relation)

2. Internal energy  
   • Candidate 1: U = 3 NkT  
   • Candidate 2: U = 3 NkT  
   (identical)

3. Comparison with an ordinary monatomic ideal gas  
   • Both note the same equation of state and a larger internal energy than the usual 3/2 NkT; Candidate 1 even states the ordinary value explicitly. There is no conflict.

Thus every required sub-answer is present in both candidates, and the quantitative results match. Extra detail in Candidate 1 does not introduce any disagreement.

The question has three sub-parts, each requiring specific formulas or statements.

1. Density of states in momentum space  
   • Candidate 1: \(D(p)=\frac{2\,V}{(4\pi\hbar^{2})^{d/2}\Gamma(d/2)}\,p^{d-1}\)  
   • Candidate 2: \(g(p)=\frac{L^{d}\,2\pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(d/2)(2\pi\hbar)^{d}}\,p^{d-1}\)

   These differ by powers of \(2\pi\), by a factor of \(\hbar\), and overall normalization, so they are not the same.

2. Density of states in energy space  
   Different overall constants and missing \(\hbar\) factors → not equivalent.

3. Critical temperature \(T_{c}\) for a box  
   • Candidate 1: \(T_{c}=\frac{2\pi\hbar^{2}}{m k_B}\bigl[\frac{N}{\zeta(d/2)V}\bigr]^{2/d}\)  
   • Candidate 2: \(T_{c}=\frac{1}{m k_B}\Bigl[\frac{n(2\pi)^{d/2}}{\Gamma(d/2)\zeta(d/2)}\Bigr]^{2/d}\)

   Extra \((2\pi)^{d/2}/\Gamma(d/2)\) factor in Candidate 2 → not the same.

4. Harmonic trap: qualitative statement and new \(T_{c}\)  
   • Candidate 1 gives only \(T_{c}=\hbar\omega\,(N/\zeta(d))^{1/d}\) (no comment).  
   • Candidate 2 gives \(T_{c}=\frac{\hbar\omega}{k_B}(N/\Gamma(d)\zeta(d))^{1/d}\) and says it “facilitates”.

   Formulas differ by \(\Gamma(d)\) and Candidate 1 omits the required qualitative comment.

Because at least one required answer in every sub-part differs (Rule 2) and units/constants do not match (Rule 1), the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers to all three sub-parts (a), (b), and (c).  
For every sub-answer the two candidates give the same mathematical expression, the only difference being the symbol in the Boltzmann factor of part (a): Candidate 1 writes e^{-ε_s/τ} while Candidate 2 writes e^{-c_s/τ}.  In the problem statement the factor is also shown as e^{-c_s/τ}; it is clear that c_s here denotes the same energy ε_s of state s. This is merely a notational variation, not a substantive difference.  

Hence every corresponding sub-answer is mathematically identical, so the two sets of answers are equivalent.

The problem requires three distinct pieces of information:

1. A general formula ( v² = dp/dρ ).
2. An isothermal speed-of-sound expression and an adiabatic one.
3. A statement of which of the two is the better approximation for air.

Candidate 1 supplies:

• v² = ∂p/∂ρ  
• isothermal: v² = RT/m  ⇒ v = √(RT/m) ≈ 280 m s⁻¹  
• adiabatic:  v² = γRT/m  ⇒ v = √(γRT/m) ≈ 331 m s⁻¹  
• “better” result: adiabatic (implicit from the 331 m s⁻¹ value)

Candidate 2 supplies:

• v² = dp/dρ  
• isothermal: v = √(RT)  
• adiabatic:  v = √(γRT)  
• “better” result: adiabatic

If R in Candidate 2 is interpreted as the specific gas constant (R_specific = R_universal / m), then √(RT) and √(γRT) are numerically identical to Candidate 1’s √(RT/m) and √(γRT/m). Thus both candidates give the same functional results for parts (b) and (c), and they both state the same general formula in part (a).

No sub-answer required by the question is missing from either candidate (Candidate 2 merely omits a redundant v² form and numerical values, which the problem does not explicitly demand).

Hence the two sets of predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas:

Candidate 1:  I = –(4 π e A m τ² / h³) (1 + V/τ) exp[ –(V – μ)/τ ]

Candidate 2:  I = (e n A /4) √(8 k τ / π m) exp[ –(V – μ)/(k τ) ]

After expressing both in the same conventions (taking k τ = τ in Candidate 1 and writing the non-degenerate density n in Candidate 2), Candidate 2 reduces to

I = (4 π e A m τ² / h³) exp[ (2μ – V)/τ ] ,

whereas Candidate 1 is

I = –(4 π e A m τ² / h³) (1 + V/τ) exp[ (μ – V)/τ ] .

They differ in:

1. An overall sign.
2. The exponential factor (exp(2μ – V) vs exp(μ – V)).
3. An extra multiplicative factor (1 + V/τ) present only in Candidate 1.

Hence the two expressions cannot be converted into each other; they predict different magnitudes (and even opposite sign) for the current.

According to the rules, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers give completely different expressions:

Candidate 1: I = −(4 π e A m τ² / h³) (1 + V/τ) exp[−(V − μ)/τ]

Candidate 2: I = A e n √(k τ / m) exp[−(V − μ)/(k τ)]

Key discrepancies

1. Different basic factors  
   • Candidate 1 contains the factor 4 π m τ² / h³ and an extra (1 + V/τ) term.  
   • Candidate 2 contains n √(k τ/m); no 4 π, no τ², no Planck constant h, and no (1 + V/τ) term.

2. Different temperature scaling and Boltzmann constant  
   • Candidate 1 puts the temperature τ directly in the exponential denominator.  
   • Candidate 2 puts k τ in the denominator (so the exponent differs by the factor k).  

3. Different sign (Candidate 1 has an overall minus sign).

4. Candidate 1 expresses the result in terms of fundamental constants and τ, while Candidate 2 keeps the number density n explicit. The two forms cannot be converted into each other without additional relations, and even then the structural differences (extra (1 + V/τ) term, different powers of τ, etc.) make them inequivalent.

Because the formulas are not the same up to any straightforward unit or constant conversion, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  

P₂¹ = 2 p₀ p (1 + e^{-ε₀/(2 τ)})  / [ p₀ + p(1 + e^{-ε₀/τ}) ]²

Candidate 2 gives  

P₂¹ = P(a + b) / [ (P + a)(P + b) ]  (after simplification),  
with a = kT e^{-ε₀/kT}, b = kT e^{-ε₀/(2kT)}.

Even if one identifies p ≡ P, p₀ ≡ kT, and τ ≡ kT, the two formulas are still different:

• Numerators:  
 C1 ∝ 2p₀(1 + e^{-ε₀/(2τ)})  
 C2 ∝ p₀(e^{-ε₀/τ} + e^{-ε₀/(2τ)})

These are not the same unless ε₀ = 0.

• Denominators:  
 C1: [ p₀ + P(1 + e^{-ε₀/τ}) ]²  
 C2: ( P + p₀e^{-ε₀/τ} )( P + p₀e^{-ε₀/(2τ)} )

Since both the numerator and denominator differ, the two candidates are not mathematically equivalent.

The two expressions are not the same.

1. Exponent signs  
  • Candidate 1 contains exp(−ε₀/τ) and exp(−ε₀/2τ).  
  • Candidate 2 contains exp(+ε₀/kT) and exp(+ε₀/2kT).  
   The temperature factors therefore enter with opposite signs.

2. Overall numerical factors  
  Even after redefining a dimensionless pressure variable (e.g. P ≔ p/p₀), Candidate 1 carries an overall factor 2 in the numerator that cannot be reproduced by Candidate 2.

3. Denominator structure  
  • Candidate 1 has a perfect square: [1 + y(1+e^{−ε₀/kT})]².  
  • Candidate 2 has the product (1 + P e^{ε₀/kT})(1 + P e^{ε₀/2kT}), which is not a square of a single bracket unless ε₀ = 0 (trivial case).  

Because of these mismatches, no consistent identification of symbols can make the two formulas identical for general ε₀, p, T.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 present different functional forms:

1. Exponential factors  
   • Candidate 1: 1 + e^{−ε₀ / (2τ)}  
   • Candidate 2: e^{+ε₀ / (k_B T)} + e^{+ε₀ / (2k_B T)}

   The signs in the exponents are opposite, and Candidate 1 is missing the e^{+ε₀ / (k_B T)} term.

2. Denominator constants  
   • Candidate 1 uses “p₀ + …”  
   • Candidate 2 uses “1 + …”

Because of these clear algebraic differences, the two expressions cannot be the same function of pressure and temperature (no simple unit rescaling can make them identical).

Candidate 1 uses a multiplicative (product) expression with alternating exponents,

Candidate 2 uses an additive (sum) expression with alternating signs,  

 EC(G,M) = Σ_{i=0}^{d-1} (−1)^i EC(Γ, H_i(Γ,M)).

A product and a sum are generally not the same object; there is no implicit conversion that would make these two formulas equivalent. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem asks for a single quantity, \operatorname{aw}([n],3), with two cases:

Candidate 1 supplies a piecewise expression in terms of \(m\):
 \(\operatorname{aw}([n],3)=m+2\) (if \(n=3^m\)),
 \(\operatorname{aw}([n],3)=m+3\) (otherwise).

Candidate 2 gives two completely different formulas:
 “answer 1” \(= \frac{3^{m}(3^{m}-1)(3^{m}-2)}{6}\),
 “answer 2” \(= \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6}\).

These outputs are of different algebraic forms and sizes (Candidate 1 is linear in \(m\), Candidate 2 is cubic in \(n\) or \(3^{m}\)). They clearly cannot coincide in general. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas.

Let k = min(m, n).

Candidate 1: γ = min(m − 1, n).  
Candidate 2: γ = 2 ⌈k / 2⌉.

Take the case m ≤ n (so k = m ≥ 3).  
• If m is even, Candidate 1 gives m − 1, while Candidate 2 gives m.  
• If m is odd, Candidate 1 gives m − 1, while Candidate 2 gives m + 1.

Since the values differ, the formulas are not identical. Similar discrepancies occur when n ≤ m and n is odd.

Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions.  
Candidate 1 depends on both m and n (min{m − 1, n}), whereas Candidate 2 depends only on m (m + (m mod 2)).  
For instance, with m = 3 and n = 3: Candidate 1 yields 2, Candidate 2 yields 4.  
Hence the predictions are not the same.

Candidate 1 contains a constant term (δ₀²), an inverse matrix (δ₀² HHᵀ + G)⁻¹, and multiplies by H P Hᵀ.  
Candidate 2 has none of those features; it simply traces H G P Gᵀ Hᵀ multiplied by δ₀².

The problem asks for two specific piecewise values of dmg(G; s).  
Each candidate supplies both parts, so we compare them term-by-term.

Part (i) (2 ≤ s ≤ ℓ):  
• Candidate 1:  (Σ k_i) − 1  
• Candidate 2:  1 + Σ k_i  
These differ by 2, hence not equal.

Part (ii) (s > ℓ):  
• Candidate 1:  n − 2  
• Candidate 2:  n  
Again they differ by 2, hence not equal.

Since at least one sub-answer in each part disagrees, Rule 2 implies the overall answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 expresses S(q) as a quotient of many different q-Pochhammer symbols, which, when written out as infinite products, gives (in terms of exponents of each factor (1 − qⁿ))

• exponent −3 on n ≡ 1,3,5 (mod 6)  
• exponent −1 on n ≡ 0 (mod 6)  
• exponent 0 on n ≡ 2,4 (mod 6).

Candidate 2, on the other hand, is  
 ∏_{n=1}^∞ (1 − q^{3n})² = (q³;q³)_∞²,

which has

• exponent +2 on all multiples of 3 (n ≡ 0,3 (mod 6))  
• exponent 0 on the other residue classes.

Since the distributions (and even the signs) of these exponents differ, the two expressions cannot be the same infinite product. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different closed-form expressions.

Candidate 2:  
S(q) = ∏_{n=1}^{∞}  1/(q;q)_n²

These are not the same object: Candidate 1 involves only a finite collection of ordinary infinite q-Pochhammer symbols, while Candidate 2 is a doubly-infinite product (an infinite product of finite products). The factors and exponents do not match, so the two expressions cannot be equivalent.

             {(q,q,q^3,q^3,q^5,q^5;q^6)_\infty}

         {(q;q)_\infty\,(q;q^6)_\infty^{2}\,(q^3;q^6)_\infty^{2}\,(q^5;q^6)_\infty^{2}}.

After expressing both answers in terms of modulus 6 Pochhammer products, they differ by the factors  
    (q^2;q^6)_\infty\,(q^4;q^6)_\infty / [ (q;q)_\infty\,(q^3;q^6)_\infty^{2} ].

Since this extra factor is not identically 1, the two results are inequivalent.

The question requires five specific outputs: θ₁, θ₂, β₁, β₂, and the optimal objective value.  

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give:

• θ₂: C1 = arcsin γ, C2 = (1/2) arcsin γ → different

These coincide only in a very limited situation (e.g., (m₁, m₂) = (1,2) gives 3 in both), but differ for most other permissible values (e.g., (1,3) → 3 vs. 4, (2,2) → 3 vs. 4, etc.). Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The task is to list every non-trivial primitive integer solution \((\alpha ,x,y,z)\) for \(\alpha =1,2,3,4\).

Candidate 1 supplies exactly four basic solution patterns, each explicitly giving both signs for \(z\):
• (1, −1, 1, ±1)  
• (2, 2, 1, ±6)  
• (3, 1, 1, ±3)  
• (4, 2, −1, ±4)

Candidate 2 supplies ten concrete tuples, all with positive \(z\):
(1, 1, 0, 1), (1, −1, 1, 1), (2, 0, 1, 2), (2, 1, 0, 1), (2, 2, 1, 6), (3, 1, 0, 1), (3, 1, 1, 3), (4, 0, 1, 4), (4, 1, 0, 1), (4, 2, −1, 4).

Comparison:

1. Candidate 2 lists six additional tuples containing a zero coordinate, which would be excluded by the “non-trivial primitive” condition but are nonetheless presented as solutions. Hence the two answer sets differ.

2. Candidate 2 omits the negative-\(z\) counterparts that Candidate 1 includes; therefore the two sets are not identical on that point either.

Because the lists are not identical—Candidate 2 both adds extra tuples and omits some sign variants—the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give exactly the same formula except that Candidate 1 explicitly writes the principal branch \(W_0\), whereas Candidate 2 writes \(W\) without a subscript. By standard convention, writing \(W(z)\) without a branch index refers to the principal branch \(W_0(z)\). Therefore both expressions denote the same quantity

\[
-\frac{e}{p}\, W_0\!\left(-\frac{p}{e}\right).
\]

Hence the answers are equivalent.
Both candidates give the same formula: 
  −(e/p)·W(−p/e) 

Candidate 1 explicitly names the principal branch W₀, while Candidate 2 writes W without a subscript. For the real argument −p/e with p∈[0,1], the default W is the principal branch, so both expressions represent the same quantity. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Unless (2m – 1)=1 (which never happens for even m≥2), multiplying Candidate 2 by (2m – 1) does not reproduce Candidate 1’s numerator. Therefore the two expressions cannot coincide.

The infinite-product parts differ: Candidate 1 has (1+q^{k−½}) and (1−q^{k})^{-2}, while Candidate 2 has only (1−q^{k})^{-1}. No finite polynomial factor can turn one into the other. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

m = q^{e}
n = q^{e}

None of these expressions coincide (for e ≥ 2), so the answers are not the same.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different expressions for all six parameters.  
They are not the same for any allowable e ≥ 2, and the functional dependence on e present in Candidate 1 is absent from Candidate 2.  
Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates state a single numerical present value in dollars.

Candidate 1: 78.3526  
Candidate 2: 78.35261665 $

Expressed to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 78.3526  
• Candidate 2: 78.35261665 → 78.3526 (first six significant digits)

The two values match to six significant digits, and both are in the same unit (dollars). Therefore, according to Rule 4, the answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 78.3526  
Candidate 2: 78.35 → expressed with 6 significant digits = 78.3500

Comparing the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 78.3526  
• Candidate 2: 78.3500  

They differ in the 5th and 6th significant digits (…26 vs …00). Therefore, the two predictions are not exactly the same to 6 significant digits.

The two candidates give different numerical results.

Candidate 1: 1.57  → 1.57000 (to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: π/2 ≈ 1.570796 … → 1.57080 (to 6 significant digits)

Since 1.57000 ≠ 1.57080 at the 6-significant-digit level, the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 1.57.  
Candidate 2 gives the exact value π/2, which equals 1.570796…  

Expressing both answers to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1 → 1.57000  
• Candidate 2 → 1.57080  

Since these differ beginning at the 5th–6th significant digits, the two answers are not identical to six significant digits. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates provide the single numerical answer “60,” which matches exactly in value and unit (a simple count) for the single quantity requested by the question. Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The two answers are numerical values in bits, so we compare them directly.

• Candidate 1: 3.7  → interpreted as 3.700000 to 6 significant digits  
• Candidate 2: log₂(13) ≈ 3.700439718 → 3.70044 to 6 significant digits  

The 6-digit sequences 3.70000 and 3.70044 are not identical.  
Hence, by Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 3.7.  
Candidate 2 gives the expression log₂13, whose numerical value is approximately 3.70044.

Comparing to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 3.700000  
• Candidate 2: 3.700440

They differ beginning at the 5th significant digit, so the two answers are not equal to the required precision.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers are numerical.  
Candidate 1 gives 3.7 (bits).  
Candidate 2 gives log₂(26) − 1 ≈ 3.70243 (bits).

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1: 3.70000  
• Candidate 2: 3.70243  

They differ at the third decimal place, so the answers are not the same.

The question asks for an angle.  
Candidate 2 explicitly gives the angle as “60°” (degrees).  
Candidate 1 gives “60.0” with no unit specified.

Because angles may reasonably be expressed in either degrees or radians, omitting the unit introduces ambiguity. According to Rule 1, when the omission of a unit can lead to confusion, the two answers are not considered equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 66.0.  
The question specifies that the answer should be in °C; candidate 2 explicitly includes the unit, while candidate 1 omits it. Because the problem clearly states “Unit: °C,” any reasonable reader would interpret an unlabeled temperature answer as being in °C. Thus the omission does not create real ambiguity.

Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

Expressed to six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 → 3.67000 0  
• Candidate 2 → 3.66666 7  

They differ already at the third decimal place, so they are not equal to six significant digits. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
Both answers represent the same numerical value:

Candidate 1: 0.75 → 0.750000 (to six significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 3/4 = 0.75 → 0.750000 (to six significant digits)

Both candidates provide the same numerical value (1).  
Expressed to six significant digits (per Rule 4):  

• Candidate 1: 1 → 1.00000  
• Candidate 2: 1.000 → 1.00000  

The two values match exactly, and there is no difference in units or in the required number of answers. Hence, the predictions are equivalent.

The problem requires an angular speed, whose common units could be rad/s, rev/s, rpm, etc.  

Candidate 2 explicitly states “0.40 rad/s.”  
Candidate 1 gives only “0.4” with no unit.

Because:

• A variety of units are reasonably possible for angular speed,  
• Candidate 1 omits the unit, introducing ambiguity,

Rule 1 states the answers are considered inequivalent when such ambiguity exists.

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two answers are both real numbers, so compare them to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Candidate 1: 65.333  
→ written to 6 significant digits: 65.3330

Candidate 2: 196/3 ≈ 65.333333…  
→ first 6 significant digits: 65.3333

Since 65.3330 ≠ 65.3333, the two results differ at the 6-significant-digit level.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 65.333 (five significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives the exact fraction 196/3, which equals 65.333333…

Express both answers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 65.3330  
• Candidate 2: 65.3333

The sixth significant digit differs (0 vs 3), so the two answers do not match to 6 significant digits.

Candidate 1 gives 3650.0 J (≈ 3.65000 × 10³ J when written with 6 significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives 3654.003 J (≈ 3.65400 × 10³ J when rounded to 6 significant digits).

Comparing the numbers digit-by-digit to 6 significant digits shows a difference (…365000 vs …365400), so they are not identical according to Rule 4.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question expects a single numerical answer in joules.

Candidate 1: 3650.0  (unit not explicitly written, but implied J)
Candidate 2: 3654.003 J

Convert/express both in the same form (J).

Compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1 = 3650.0 J → 3650.00 when written with 6 significant digits.
• Candidate 2 = 3654.003 J → 3654.00 (rounded to 6 significant digits).

The two values differ (3650.00 ≠ 3654.00).  
Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives “81600.0” with no unit.  
Candidate 2 gives “7.05 eV”.

The question explicitly asks for an answer “in eV”.  
81600 is of the order of the Fermi temperature in kelvin, not in eV; if interpreted as eV it would be wildly off-scale. The omission of a unit therefore makes Candidate 1 ambiguous and, in any reasonable interpretation, not equal to 7.05 eV.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same number, 937.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same numerical value: 5.93.  

The question explicitly requests the answer in Mebibytes (MiB), so the only acceptable unit is MiB.  
Candidate 2 states the unit explicitly (“MiB”), while Candidate 1 omits it. Since the context dictates a single unambiguous unit (MiB), Candidate 1’s omission does not create confusion; it is naturally interpreted as 5.93 MiB.

Hence, the two answers are equivalent.

  → equals 7.0095 %

• Candidate 2: 7.01 %  
  → equals 0.0701 in decimal form

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.0700950  
• Candidate 2: 0.0701000

The digits differ beginning at the fifth significant digit (…0950 vs …1000). Under Rule 4, two real-number answers must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent. They do not match, so the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: 4.65000 × 10⁻³⁴ m

The question explicitly asks for the wavelength “in meters.” Candidate 2 explicitly writes “m,” while Candidate 1 omits the unit, but meters are the only reasonable unit in this context; the omission therefore does not create ambiguity.  

Hence, the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 0.16667.  
Candidate 2 gives the exact fraction 1/6 = 0.166666…

Expressing both to six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 → 0.166670  
• Candidate 2 → 0.166666  

The two values differ at the 6-th significant digit, so per Rule 4 they are not considered the same.
First, rewrite both numeric answers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

Candidate 1: 0.16667  →  0.166670  
Candidate 2: 1/6 = 0.166666…  →  0.166667

Comparing 0.166670 vs 0.166667 shows a difference in the 5th significant digit; they do not match to 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question explicitly states that the answer should be expressed “in πHz.”  

• Candidate 1 gives “500” with no unit. It could be understood as 500 πHz (since the required unit is πHz).  
• Candidate 2 gives “500 Hz,” which is in plain hertz, not πHz. 1 πHz = π Hz, so 500 πHz ≈ 1570.796 Hz, which is not the same as 500 Hz.  

Because the units differ and the numerical meanings are therefore different, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 1).

Candidate 1 gives “10.0” with no unit, while Candidate 2 gives “10 bits.”  
Because the unit “bits” is explicitly stated in Candidate 2 but omitted in Candidate 1, and capacity could reasonably be expressed in different information units (bits, nats, etc.), the omission introduces ambiguity under Rule 1. Therefore, the two answers are not considered equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical answer for the P/E ratio.

Candidate 1: 15.0  
Candidate 2: 15

Treating both as real numbers (Rule 4), we compare them to 6 significant digits:

15.0 → 15.0000  
15   → 15.0000

They match exactly, and there is no unit or multi-part ambiguity. Hence the predictions are equivalent.

The question expects one numerical answer in m/s.  
• Candidate 1 gives 1750.0 (implicitly m/s).  
• Candidate 2 gives 1769 m/s.  

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits (Rule 4):  
1750.0 → 1 750.00 (extend to six sig. digits)  
1769 → 1 769.00  

They differ already in the third significant digit (5 vs 6). Hence the numerical values are not identical to six significant digits, so the answers are not equivalent.

The numeric value of Candidate 2 evaluates to approximately 2.84329.

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 2.843000  
• Candidate 2 → 2.843290  

Since these differ at the 5th–6th significant digits, the two answers are not identical to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Therefore, they are not equivalent.
The problem asks for one numerical area value.

Candidate 1 gives a single decimal number: 2.843  
Candidate 2 gives an exact radical/log expression.

To check equivalence, evaluate Candidate 2 numerically:

(π/2)·[√5 – √2/2 + ½ ln((2+√5)/(1+√2))]
 = (π/2)·1.8100915695…  
 ≈ 2.843285 … 

Express both answers to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 2.84300  
• Candidate 2 → 2.84328

They differ beginning with the 5-th significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not the same result.

Candidate 1: −64.62  
Candidate 2: −12√29 ≈ −64.621978  

Expressing both to 6 significant digits:  
• Candidate 1: −64.620000  
• Candidate 2: −64.621978 → six significant digits: −64.621979 (after rounding the 7th digit)

Since −64.620000 ≠ −64.621979 at the 5th significant digit, the two values are not equal to 6 significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers represent real numbers.

Convert candidate 2 to a decimal:
    −12 √29 ≈ −12 × 5.385164807 … = −64.62197768 …

Express each to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1: −64.6200  
• Candidate 2: −64.6220  (rounded from −64.621977…)

Since −64.6200 ≠ −64.6220 at 6 significant digits, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value (3.10000 when written to six significant digits).  
The omitted unit in Candidate 1 does not create ambiguity because the question explicitly asks for the energy “in eV,” so only one unit is reasonable.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

Both answers give the same numerical value: 3.1 vs 3.10.

Therefore, according to Rule 1 (unit consistency) and Rule 4 (numeric comparison to six significant digits), the two predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 lists the pair “[2, 3]”, which naturally reads as requiring A’s eigenvalues to be exactly 2 and 3 (both of them).

Candidate 2 states that “A must have 2 or 3 as an eigenvalue,” which only requires at least one of the two numbers to appear as an eigenvalue (it allows matrices whose eigenvalues are, for example, {2, 2} or {3, 5}).

Because Candidate 1 demands both eigenvalues while Candidate 2 demands at least one, the conditions describe different sets of matrices.

Both candidates give the same numerical value:

• Candidate 2: $3,448.10 → numerical part 3448.10.

They match to at least 6 significant digits (3448.100000 vs 3448.100000). The presence of the dollar sign in Candidate 2 and its absence in Candidate 1 does not create ambiguity, since the problem clearly asks for a monetary amount and Candidate 1’s figure can naturally be taken in dollars.

Hence, the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same single numerical answer for the annuity’s future value:

Both candidates give the same numerical value 1.18 for the gauge pressure.  

• The problem statement specifies the unit “10^5 Pa.”  
   – Candidate 1: “1.18” (implicitly 1.18 × 10^5 Pa because the unit is fixed by the question).  
   – Candidate 2: “1.18 × 10^5 Pa” (explicitly includes the unit).  

Thus, after accounting for the stated unit, both answers represent 1.18 × 10^5 Pa and are equivalent.
Both answers correspond to the same physical quantity:

• Candidate 1 gives 1.18 in the prescribed unit “10⁵ Pa,” i.e. 1.18 × 10⁵ Pa.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly writes 1.18 × 10⁵ Pa.

After putting them in the same unit (Pa), both equal 1.18 × 10⁵ Pa, identical to at least six significant digits. Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The two answers differ numerically:

• Candidate 1: 36983.35  
• Candidate 2: 36,983.00

Expressed to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 36983.4  
• Candidate 2 → 36983.0  

Since 36983.4 ≠ 36983.0, the answers do not match to 6 significant digits, so they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 13.609.  
Candidate 2 gives the numerical value 871/64 = 13.609375.

To compare per Rule 4, write each to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 13.6090  
• Candidate 2: 13.6094  (13.609375 rounded to six significant digits)

They differ at the sixth significant digit (0 vs 4), so the two answers are not the same.

The question expects a single list of “target keys” for node N1.  

• Candidate 1 gives the list [2, 3, 5, 9, 17, 33].  
• Candidate 2 gives a different list: N11, N15, N23, N31, N40, N45, N51, N60, N63.

These lists are clearly different in both content and length (numbers vs. node IDs). Hence they are not equivalent according to Rule 3 (list comparison) and Rule 6 (type mismatch).

The two candidates give different numerical results.

Candidate 1: 19.095  
Candidate 2: (17 π⁶)/128 + (π³)/8 – (π²)/8 ≈ 130.327

Since 19.095 ≠ 130.327 (they differ well before 6 significant digits), the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 19.095.

Candidate 2 gives 
 (5 π⁴)/32 + (π³)/8 – (π²)/8  
≈ 17.86225450833981.

Comparing the two real numbers to 6 significant digits:

19.095000 vs. 17.862255  → not equal.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two separate “yes/no”-type answers, returned as a list in order:
1. Does the sequence converge in probability?
2. Does it converge almost surely?

Candidate 1 replies with the list [1, 0].
Candidate 2 replies with the list [True, False].

Interpreting 1 → “True/Yes” and 0 → “False/No”, the two candidates give exactly the same pair of answers:
• First component: 1 ≡ True  
• Second component: 0 ≡ False  

The order and multiplicity match, and there is no ambiguity about units or additional required components. Therefore the two candidates’ predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for “possible values” of g(2023), i.e., two numerical answers.  
Both candidates supply two numbers with the same signs, so we compare the numerical values.

True value of 2/3 = 0.666666… (and −2/3 = −0.666666…).  
Candidate 1 gives 0.6667 and −0.6667.  
Candidate 2 gives 2/3 and −2/3 (0.666666…, −0.666666…).

Using Rule 4, we must match to 6 significant digits:

• 0.6667 written to 6 significant digits is 0.666700  
• 2/3 written to 6 significant digits is 0.666667  

They differ at the 5-th and 6-th significant digits (700 vs 667). The same mismatch occurs for the negative values.

Therefore the two candidates’ numerical answers are not identical to 6 significant digits, so the predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the two possible values as the decimals 0.6667 and –0.6667.  
Candidate 2 gives them as the exact fractions 2/3 (= 0.666666…) and –2/3 (= –0.666666…).

Applying Rule 4: we must compare the numbers to 6 significant digits.

• 2/3 expressed to 6 significant digits is 0.666667.  
• 0.6667, padded to 6 significant digits, is 0.666700.

Because 0.666700 ≠ 0.666667 at the 6-significant-digit level (and similarly for the negative values), the corresponding numbers do not match under the rule’s strict criterion.

Therefore the two candidate answers are not considered equivalent.

The two numerical answers must match to 6 significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 30.15928896 → 6‐significant‐digit form: 30.1593  
• Candidate 2: 30.159 → 6‐significant‐digit form: 30.1590  

Since 30.1593 ≠ 30.1590, the answers are not equivalent.

Expressing each value to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 2: 0.170513

Because these 6-digit numbers differ, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both answers give the same numerical value, 39.4.  
The question explicitly asks for the energy “in TeV,” so candidate 1’s unit-less “39.4” is naturally interpreted as 39.4 TeV. Because only one unit is appropriate in context, the omission of “TeV” does not create ambiguity. Candidate 2 explicitly states “39.4 TeV.” Hence the two responses are equivalent.

The question specifically requests the object distance “in terms of meter,” so meters are the only reasonable unit.  

Candidate 1: “9.05”  
Candidate 2: “9.05 m”

Both give the same numerical value, and the omission of “m” in Candidate 1 does not introduce ambiguity, because meters are implied by the problem statement. Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The two candidates present numeric answers.

Candidate 1: −2.47160136  
Candidate 2: −2.471

Rule 4 requires comparison to 6 significant digits.  
• Candidate 1 (rounded/truncated to 6 sig. figs) → −2.47160  
• Candidate 2 supplies only 4 significant digits (−2.471xx); the remaining digits are unknown.

Since the numbers do not match to 6 significant digits, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a numeric approximation 2.301 (interpretable as 2.30100 to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives the exact expression e^{5/6}, whose numerical value is approximately 2.300976 ≈ 2.30098 to six significant digits.  

Comparing 2.30100 and 2.30098 digit-by-digit, they already disagree at the fourth significant digit, so they do NOT match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
