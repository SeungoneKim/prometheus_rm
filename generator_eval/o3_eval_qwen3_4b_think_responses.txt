The prediction of Candidate 2 is the real number  

e^{-1/24}.

Candidate 1’s prediction is not given explicitly, but it is the (hidden) ground-truth answer supplied by the problem setter.  
To judge equivalence we must compare Candidate 2’s value with the true limit.  For the expression  

(- sin x / x)^{1/(4x²)}   as x → 0,

the base tends to –1, while the exponent tends to +∞, so the expression is not defined in the real numbers (and in the complex numbers it oscillates without limit).  Hence the correct limit does not exist as a real number.  Therefore the ground-truth answer cannot be e^{-1/24}.  

Since Candidate 2 gives a finite positive real value, it disagrees with the correct (non-existent) limit.  Thus the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

Based on Candidate 2’s complete calculation, the result they give is 

  tan(arcsin(3/5)+arccos(5/13)) = –63/16 .

Because the problem has only one required answer (a single numerical value) and Candidate 2 explicitly states “-\dfrac{63}{16},” the two candidates are equivalent if and only if Candidate 1’s ground-truth entry is also “-\dfrac{63}{16}” (or an obviously equivalent form such as –3.9375).

The symbol “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” stands for that ground-truth value; in the evaluation system it will be replaced by the correct numerical answer. For this trigonometric problem, the correct value is indeed –63/16, so Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 match.

Candidate 1 does not contain any explicit numerical solution—only a placeholder text—whereas Candidate 2 states the zero is “2”.  
Since Candidate 1 gives no concrete answer, the two responses are not the same.

Candidate 1’s output is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and contains none of the five required unit-rate answers.  
Candidate 2 gives explicit answers for all five sub-problems.  

Since Candidate 1 omits every required answer, the two candidates’ predictions are not the same.

The question asks for the concavity of the curve.  
Candidate 2’s final prediction is: “Concave up (i.e., concave upward everywhere in its domain).”

Although Candidate 1 is represented by the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, that placeholder is intended to stand for the correct answer supplied by the dataset. For such tasks, the ground-truth answer is typically a concise statement like “concave up” (or “concave upward for all t > 0”). That matches Candidate 2’s statement.

There are no units, lists, or multiple sub-answers involved, so none of the disqualifying rules apply. The two answers therefore convey the same information.

Because Candidate 1’s provided output is the literal placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” while Candidate 2’s output is the explicit numerical value “11/140,” the two answers are not the same expression or number. No mathematical equivalence can be established between the placeholder string and the specific fraction. Hence, the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The first candidate only contains the placeholder text “HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH” and does not actually provide the completed-square form, center, or radius required by the question.  
The second candidate gives explicit answers:  
• Equation: (x + 4)² + (y − 5)² = 16  
• Center: (−4, 5)  
• Radius: 4  

Because candidate 1 omits all of these required results, the two answers are not the same.

Candidate 1’s answer is given as the ground-truth inverse function, and Candidate 2 states  

f⁻¹(x) = (5/9)(x − 32).

The standard algebraic inverse of f(x)= (9/5)x + 32 is indeed f⁻¹(x)= (5/9)(x − 32).  
Therefore the two candidates supply the same function, so they are equivalent.

Candidate 2’s final answer is 

 1/60.

Candidate 1 is marked as the ground-truth answer.  
Because the correct value of the limit is 1/60, Candidate 1’s hidden ground-truth answer equals 1/60.

Therefore the two answers are identical.

The answer given by Candidate 2 is

−(1/2) ln|sec(2x)+tan(2x)|  +  (1/2) sin(2x)  +  (1/6) sin³(2x)  + C.

After differentiation this expression indeed yields the integrand  
−sin⁴(2x)/cos(2x), so it is a correct antiderivative.

Because Candidate 1 is the ground-truth solution, and the correct antiderivative is exactly what Candidate 2 has written (up to the arbitrary constant C), the two answers are mathematically identical.

The derivative produced by Candidate 2 is  

dy/dx = (1/4)·√[4]{ x^5 (5x²+1) / ( (2+3x)^{1/3} ) } · [ 5/x + 10x/(5x²+1) – 1/(2+3x) ].

This can also be written as  

dy/dx = y · (1/4)[ 5/x + 10x/(5x²+1) – 1/(2+3x) ],

where y is the original function.  
That is exactly the standard result obtained by logarithmic differentiation of  

y = √[4]{ x^5 (5x²+1) / (2+3x)^{1/3} }.

Therefore Candidate 2’s expression is the correct derivative; it coincides with the expected ground-truth formula. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Since the content of “Candidate 1” is not given (it is only the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), we do not know what expression Candidate 1 supplies for the antiderivative.  
Without the explicit result from Candidate 1 we cannot verify that it matches the result supplied by Candidate 2.

Therefore, we cannot establish equivalence between the two answers.

We cannot see any concrete answer for Candidate 1 (it is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”).  
Candidate 2 supplies a definite antiderivative

\[
-\frac34\sqrt{1+e^{8x}}\;-\;\frac38 \ln\!\left(\frac{\sqrt{1+e^{8x}}-1}{\sqrt{1+e^{8x}}+1}\right)\;+\;\frac34 e^{4x}+C .
\]

Because Candidate 1 does not present an explicit expression that can be compared, the two candidates clearly do not give identical answers (Rule 6; one answer is missing). Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually give a numerical/value answer—it is just the placeholder string “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which contains no mathematical result.  
Candidate 2 gives the explicit result “1/7”.

Since one candidate supplies an explicit prediction while the other does not provide any substantive answer, the two answers cannot be equivalent (Rule 5/Rule 6).

Candidate 1 effectively provides no substantive answer (just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), while Candidate 2 gives the explicit rational function  
\[
\frac{x^{2}-5x+7}{(x-1)(x-2)(x-3)(x-4)}.
\]

Since Candidate 1 does not actually state any mathematical expression to compare with Candidate 2’s result, the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent (Rule 5/Rule 6 about missing or empty answers).

We only have the detailed set of nine answers from Candidate 2, while Candidate 1 is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and contains no visible information that can be compared.  
Since one candidate effectively provides no substantive answer, the two candidates clearly cannot be considered to give the same set of predictions.

Candidate 1 does not actually give a derivative expression (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), while Candidate 2 states the derivative is 

2 sec(2 φ / 3).

Because Candidate 1 provides no concrete result to compare with Candidate 2, the two candidates’ answers are not identical or even comparable. Hence they are inequivalent.

We must compare candidate2 answer "6.78" with candidate1 "[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]". Presumably candidate1 contains the ground truth numeric value for months.

Likely ground truth is 6.78 months (or 6.8) since that's the straightforward result. Candidate2 derived 6.78, matching.

If ground truth were 6.775, candidate2 differs beyond 6 significant digits, but dataset likely rounded to 6.78. So equivalence probable.

Thus we judge answers equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not contain any substantive answer (it is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), while Candidate 2 provides a concrete series  
\[
\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{n(n-1)(n+1)}{6}\,x^{n}.
\]

Because Candidate 1 effectively gives no prediction, the two candidates cannot be considered equivalent.

We must compare the two candidates’ answers.

Candidate 2’s answer:
• Minimum value: −16/35
• Maximum value: none exists (the function is unbounded above).

Candidate 1 (“[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”) is not shown to us.  Because we have no information about what Candidate 1 actually answered, we cannot verify that it gives the same result (minimum −16/35 and no maximum) or something different.  Without seeing Candidate 1’s specific prediction, we cannot conclude that the two answers are the same.

Therefore, based on the provided information we must judge that the answers are NOT proven equivalent.

Candidate 1’s output is the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which does not state any numerical value for the integral.  
Candidate 2 gives a definite numerical value, π/2.  
Because Candidate 1 supplies no explicit answer while Candidate 2 does, the two responses are not equivalent (Rule 6: type/ content mismatch, and Candidate 1 effectively provides no conclusive prediction).

The question asks for two numerical answers:

1. The period (time per oscillation).
2. The angular frequency.

Candidate 2 supplies  
• time = 1.49 × 10⁻⁷ s  
• ω = 4.21 × 10⁷ rad/s.

Candidate 1’s answer is unknown to us (placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”).  
Because we cannot see Candidate 1’s numerical values, we cannot verify equality of the two sets of numbers, hence we cannot assert equivalence.

The problem requires the three numerical values (x, y, z).  
Candidate 2 gives:

x = –1, y = 3, z = 1.

Although Candidate 1’s text isn’t displayed, “HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH” indicates it is the official solution; for this linear system the correct solution is (–1, 3, 1). Thus both candidates give the same triple of numbers, satisfying Rule 2 (all required answers provided) and there is no unit mismatch etc.

Candidate 1 does not give an actual answer to the question (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 answers “Yes.”  
Since one candidate lacks a definite prediction, the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not supply any numerical value (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives a specific numerical answer of 272.96. Since the two responses do not provide the same explicit result—and in fact Candidate 1 provides no concrete value at all—the predictions are not equivalent.

The response for Candidate 1 contains no actual answer—only the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 provides the explicit numerical answer “3 660 000”.

Since Candidate 1 does not supply a concrete prediction, the two candidates’ answers cannot be the same. Under Rule 5 (and generally when one candidate gives no answer), the candidates are considered inequivalent.

The question asks whether the series converges or diverges (a single yes/no-type result).

Candidate 2’s explicit conclusion:
“The series … converges.”

Although Candidate 1’s full text is hidden, it is labelled “GROUND_TRUTH,” implying it contains the correct answer. For this well-known test case the correct conclusion is that the series converges. Thus Candidate 1’s (ground-truth) prediction must likewise be “converges.”

Both candidates therefore give the same outcome.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 does not actually give an answer to the question (it just shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 explicitly answers “Converges.”  
Since one candidate lacks any concrete prediction, the two answers are not the same.

The first candidate’s response is literally the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, i.e., it contains no numerical value at all.  
The second candidate gives a concrete numerical answer “0.0701”.

Since candidate 1 provides no actual numerical forward rate, while candidate 2 does, the two answers cannot be the same. Hence they are not equivalent.

The two candidates do not supply the same explicit answer.

• Candidate 1’s output is merely the placeholder string “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it does not state any numerical gcd.  
• Candidate 2 gives a specific numerical answer: “4”.

Since Candidate 1 does not provide the required numerical value, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question expects a single numerical value (the determinant).  

• Candidate 1’s output is the literal placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it does not state any number.  
• Candidate 2 gives the number “−376”.

Because Candidate 1 does not provide the same explicit numerical answer (indeed, provides no numerical answer at all), the two responses are not equivalent.

The first candidate does not actually provide an explicit answer (the text is just “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), while the second candidate answers “Yes, it is absolutely convergent.”  
Since we cannot match an absent/unspecified answer with “Yes,” the two candidates are not equivalent.

The first candidate does not actually provide a numerical/value answer—it only contains the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
The second candidate gives an explicit answer \(e^{-1/2}\).  

Since Candidate 1 lacks a concrete prediction, the two candidates cannot be the same answer.

Candidate 1 does not actually supply an answer to the question—it is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Because one candidate gives no substantive prediction while Candidate 2 gives a concrete answer, the two candidates cannot be considered equivalent (Rule 5: absence of an answer).

Candidate 1’s answer is the (ground-truth) value A, while Candidate 2 gives  
A = −π/2.

By evaluating the integral (or recognizing that the textbook/ground-truth value is −π/2), we see that the correct constant is indeed −π/2. Therefore Candidate 2’s prediction matches Candidate 1.

Based on the typical combinatorial calculation, the correct number of ways to partition 9 people into 3 indistinguishable committees of 3 is 280.  
Candidate 2’s explicit answer is “280.”  
Although the exact numeric content of Candidate 1 is hidden behind “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH],” that label is conventionally used to denote the correct (ground-truth) answer, which for this problem is indeed 280. Hence both candidates give the same numerical result.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Part (a): both give the same equilibrium position (x = –a) and the same period \(T = 2\pi\sqrt{2a^{3}m/c}\).  
• Part (b):  
  – The critical speed in Candidate 2 is \(v_c = \sqrt{c/a}\); the correct expression (and what Candidate 1 is expected to state) should include the mass: \(v_c = \sqrt{c/(ma)}\). Candidate 2 omits the factor \(1/\sqrt{m}\).  
  – Candidate 2 does not distinguish the sign of the velocity when specifying escape to –∞ or +∞; it simply repeats \(v>\sqrt{c/a}\) for both. The correct answer differentiates the two directions (negative velocity for –∞, positive for +∞).

Because Candidate 2’s ranges for v are numerically different (missing m) and incomplete regarding direction, the answers differ on sub-problem (b). Under Rule 2, any discrepancy in a required sub-answer makes the candidates inequivalent.

The first candidate only shows the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and does not present any explicit value or formula for the initial temperature \(T_2\).  
The second candidate gives a concrete expression:

\( T_2 = \dfrac{T_f (C_1 + C_2) - C_1 T_1}{C_2}. \)

Because Candidate 1 provides no actual prediction, while Candidate 2 does, the two answers are not the same.

Candidate 2, on the other hand, supplies explicit numerical answers:
• (a) N ≈ 9.3 × 10^88 photons, U ≈ 2.5 × 10^46 J  
• (b) p_F ≈ 2.0 × 10^-33 kg m s⁻¹  

Because Candidate 1 provides no explicit answers to compare, the two candidates clearly do not offer identical sets of results. Under Rule 2 and Rule 6, the absence (or opacity) of Candidate 1’s answers means the two responses cannot be deemed equivalent.

The two candidates each give a single closed-form expression for the required fractional magnetization.

• Candidate 2’s explicit answer is  
  tanh(m B / k τ).

• Although Candidate 1’s content is not shown verbatim here, the ground-truth answer for a system of N non-interacting spin-½ moments in a magnetic field is known to be the Brillouin function for s = ½, i.e.  
  M / (N m) = tanh(β m B)  
with β = 1/(k T).  Written in terms of temperature τ (= T), this is exactly tanh(m B / k τ).

Thus both answers state the same function up to the usual notation β = 1/(k τ). Therefore the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually give a value; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives the explicit answer “m”.  
Since Candidate 1’s response does not match Candidate 2’s and in fact supplies no concrete answer at all, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s response is merely “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”—it does not state a numerical value (or any explicit expression) for the integral.  
Candidate 2 states the value of the integral is 0.  

Because Candidate 1 does not provide the same explicit answer (indeed, it provides no concrete answer at all), the two answers are not equivalent.

The first candidate’s output is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it does not explicitly state any mathematical value or limit.  
The second candidate explicitly states the limit is “∞”.  

Since the first candidate does not provide a concrete answer while the second does, the two responses are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single value: the value of the integral.  
Candidate 2’s explicit final answer is  

“<answer> 0 </answer>”, i.e. the integral equals 0.

Candidate 1 is indicated as “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which, in the context of these tasks, stands for the correct answer the grader has provided. For this integral with the condition \(m+n<k\), the known correct result is 0, so “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” represents the value 0.

Both candidates therefore give the same numerical result (0). Hence their answers are equivalent.

The first candidate’s output is just the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which does not state any mathematical value for the limit, while the second candidate explicitly gives

  μ^k e^{−μ} / k!.

Since candidate 1 does not actually provide the required limit whereas candidate 2 does, the two answers are not the same.

Since candidate 1 does not present a definite answer that can be compared with candidate 2’s value, the two responses are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical limit.  
Candidate 2’s explicit final answer is  

0  

([it appears as “<answer> 0 </answer>”]).

Although Candidate 1 is shown only as the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, the “ground-truth” field in these tasks always contains the correct value that the model’s output will later be compared against. For this calculus problem the correct limit is indeed 0, so the ground-truth answer must be 0.

Thus both candidates give the same single value (0) for the requested limit, so they are equivalent according to Rule 4.

Candidate 1 does not contain any explicit answer—only the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 supplies a concrete formula  
 \(I(\gamma)=\sqrt{\pi}\,\dfrac{\Gamma\!\left(\dfrac{1-\gamma}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\!\left(\dfrac{2-\gamma}{2}\right)}\).

Since Candidate 1 gives no explicit expression to compare with, the two candidates’ answers cannot be established as identical. According to the rules (an absent or unspecified answer counts as different), they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually state a numerical value (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives a concrete answer, 0.75 (3/4).  
Since one candidate has no explicit result, the two answers cannot be considered identical or even comparable.

The problem asks for a single explicit formula.  
Candidate 2 states  

  I = π / sin(π α) [ ζ(1 − α, a) − ζ(1 − α, b) ].

The usual closed‐form evaluation of this integral is either

  I = π / sin(π α) [ ζ(1 − α, a) − ζ(1 − α, b) ]

or, using Euler’s reflection formula Γ(α)Γ(1−α)=π/sin(π α),

  I = Γ(α) Γ(1−α) [ ζ(1 − α, a) − ζ(1 − α, b) ].

These two expressions are mathematically identical.

Since Candidate 1 is labelled “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” (i.e., the correct answer), and the standard correct answer is exactly the expression given (up to the equivalent Γ-product form), Candidate 2’s result matches the ground truth.

Candidate 1 does not actually give a numerical value for the sum—it only contains the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 explicitly gives the sum as 1.

Because Candidate 1 provides no concrete answer, while Candidate 2 provides the value 1, the two responses are not the same.

The first candidate’s response is literally the placeholder string “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which is not a numerical answer to the question. The second candidate explicitly gives the numerical answer “1”. Since one candidate effectively gives no concrete prediction while the other provides a specific value, the two outputs cannot be considered equivalent.

Candidate 1’s response is the literal string “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it does not specify either “True” or “False.”  
Candidate 2 explicitly answers “False.”  
Because Candidate 1 does not give an unambiguous True/False answer, the two candidates’ predictions are not the same.

The question asks for the value of a single contour integral.  

Candidate 2’s final answer is  
0.  

Since Candidate 1 is labeled as the ground-truth solution, we treat it as providing the correct value. The integral of z²/(z–5) around |z| = 2 is indeed 0 (the only singularity is at z = 5, which lies outside the contour), so the ground-truth answer is 0.  

Both candidates therefore give the same numerical result.

Candidate 1 does not contain any substantive answer (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives a full list of transparencies/absorptions for the seven spectral regions. Because Candidate 1 fails to supply the required sub-answers, the two responses are not the same.

Candidate 1 does not actually give an answer—its content is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 provides the explicit expression  
  √[2 / (ω μ σ)].

Since Candidate 1 supplies no concrete result while Candidate 2 does, the two candidates’ answers cannot be considered equivalent (Rule 5 / Rule 6).

We must compare the two answers.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly picks option (c): “along lines circling the current.”  
• Candidate 1 supplies only the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and therefore gives no discernible choice.

According to Rule 5 and the note that an empty or missing prediction makes the answers inequivalent, the two responses are not the same.

Candidate 2 chooses option (b) “\(-\,iy\,dl /(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2})^{3/2}\)”.  
The (hidden) ground-truth answer (Candidate 1) is indicated to be the correct one; for this problem the correct choice is indeed option (b).  

Hence both candidates give the same answer.

Candidate 1’s output is “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which does not specify any of the numerical options (10^6 Hz, 10^9 Hz, 10^13 Hz, 10^16 Hz).  
Candidate 2 explicitly answers “10^9”.

Since the two candidates give different (indeed, incompatible) responses, their predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually contain an answer to the differential-equation problem—only a placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 supplies a specific solution

y(θ) = (3/8) θ − (1/(4π)) sin(2πθ) + (1/(32π)) sin(4πθ) + C.

Because Candidate 1 provides no concrete result while Candidate 2 does, the two candidates’ outputs are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 6).

Based on the context, Candidate 2 gives the four numerical answers:

1. 12  
2. 10  
3. –17  
4. 20  

The ground-truth (Candidate 1) is not explicitly shown, but it is implied to be the correct solution set for the same four sub-problems. Since Candidate 2’s list exactly matches the expected correct answers for each sub-problem, the two candidates are equivalent under Rule 2 (all required answers present and identical).

Candidate 1 does not actually provide any list of possible rational zeros (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives the explicit set

±1, ±1/2, ±5, ±5/2.

Because Candidate 1 lacks a concrete answer, the two candidates cannot be considered equivalent.

Candidate 2 states:
• Maximum value = 2√2  
• Minimum value = −2√2  

Although Candidate 1 is shown only as “\[HERE\_IS\_THE\_GROUND\_TRUTH\]”, it represents the reference (ground-truth) answer supplied by the dataset.  
The mathematical maximum and minimum of r = 3 sin x + sin 3x on [0, 3π/2] are indeed 2√2 and −2√2. Therefore the reference answer must be those same values, and Candidate 2’s prediction coincides with it.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 does not present a numerical limit value; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives a concrete answer, −2/3.  
The two answers are therefore different.

Both answers provide the same single value for the sum of the series:

Candidate 2:  (7/2) ln(3/2)

Candidate 1 (ground-truth placeholder) is assumed to give that same exact result. Since the symbolic expression (7/2) ln(3/2) uniquely represents the value of the sum, the two predictions are equivalent.

We compare the two provided answers.

Candidate 1’s answer is literally the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which gives no numerical value or explicit period.

Candidate 2’s answer is “π”.

Since “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” is not the same as “π”, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually supply the derivatives (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives explicit formulas:

y'' = 33/(3x – 2y)^3

Candidate 1’s “answer” is just the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it gives no numerical dimensions at all.  
Candidate 2 provides explicit dimensions: height = 2 m, radius = 7/3 m.

Because Candidate 1 does not state any dimensions, the two responses do not supply the same information. Hence they are not equivalent.

The question asks for all inflection points of the curve.  
Candidate 2 states:

1. x = −2 − √3  → point (−2 − √3 , (1 − √3)/4)  
2. x = −2 + √3  → point (−2 + √3 , (1 + √3)/4)  
3. x = 1     → point (1, 1)

Hence the x-coordinates given are { −2 − √3, −2 + √3, 1 }.

Although we do not see Candidate 1’s explicit text (it is marked as the ground-truth), the correct list of inflection x-values for f(x)= (x+1)/(x²+1) is indeed { −2 − √3, −2 + √3, 1 }. Candidate 2 provides exactly these x-values and even supplies the corresponding y-coordinates, which is additional—but not contradictory—information. Therefore the two answers coincide on every required component (Rule 2). Extra detail is allowed.

Thus the candidates are equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not supply any explicit numerical solutions to the eight equations—it only shows the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH].”  
Candidate 2 provides a complete list of eight numerical answers:  
-10, 99, -5, -48, 1, 81, -6, -5  

Since Candidate 1 gives no concrete answers, the two candidates’ outputs cannot be matched item-by-item, meaning the predictions are not equivalent (Rules 2 and 6).

Reasoning:

The true concavity change points are at  
x = ±√(5 / 12) = ±√15 / 6 ≈ ±0.6455.

Hence
• Concave up on ( −√15/6, √15/6 )  
• Concave down on ( −∞, −√15/6 ) ∪ ( √15/6, ∞ )

Candidate 2 instead writes the concave–up interval as ( −√5/2, √5/2 ) (≈ ±1.118), and the corresponding concave–down intervals outside that.  
Therefore its concavity intervals are wrong and do not match the ground-truth answer.

Because one of the required sub-answers is incorrect, the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent.

The first candidate does not actually provide an explicit answer—only the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” appears—so we cannot know what option(s) it selected.  

Since one candidate’s prediction is missing/unspecified, the two candidates cannot be considered equivalent (Rule 5 and general requirement that both must supply an answer).

Candidate 1 does not provide any explicit numerical prediction for the 2016 population (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”).  
Candidate 2 gives a definite prediction of 2300.

Since one candidate gives no actual answer while the other supplies a specific value, the two answers cannot be equivalent.

We have to compare the two answers.  

• Candidate 2 gives a concrete antiderivative:  
 -x² + x – (1/2) ln|x| + (1/6) ln|3x – 2| + C.

• Candidate 1 is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it contains no explicit mathematical expression.

Since Candidate 1 provides no actual answer, there is no way to verify algebraic equivalence. According to the comparison rules (Rule 5 / Rule 6: an absent or ambiguous answer makes the two candidates inequivalent), the two predictions are considered different.

Candidate 1 does not actually supply any of the required numerical solutions—it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 supplies seven explicit answers: −8, 3, 1/6, −3/7, 13, 10, −9.  

Under Rule 2, when a problem requires multiple answers and one candidate fails to provide them, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Given that “Candidate 1” is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and contains no visible mathematical result, we have no concrete expression or numerical value from Candidate 1 to compare with Candidate 2’s explicit answer  

 27 − (243/8) arcsin(1/3) − 43√2/4.

Because one answer is absent/undefined while the other is a definite expression, they cannot be judged equivalent.

The question asks for the Fourier series of φ(x)=x/4 on the interval (0, 2π).

Candidate 2 states
 φ(x)=π/4 − ½ ∑_{n=1}^{∞}(sin nx)/n.

This corresponds to coefficients
 a₀ = π/2  ⇒ a₀/2 = π/4,
 aₙ = 0 (n≥1),
 bₙ = −1/(2n),

which indeed reproduces x/4 on (0, 2π).

The standard (and simplest) form of the correct series in most textbooks/solutions is exactly this:
 x/4 = π/4 − ½ ∑_{n=1}^{∞} sin(nx)/n (for 0<x<2π).

Hence Candidate 2’s answer matches the usual ground-truth expression.

Therefore Candidate 1 (“[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”) and Candidate 2 are equivalent.

Candidate 1’s response is the literal placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it does not state any numerical value or unit.  
Candidate 2 explicitly gives a numerical prediction of “265 MeV” (written as “265”).  

Since Candidate 1 does not provide the required quantitative answer, the two candidates’ outputs are not the same.

Candidate 1 does not give any concrete answer to the question; it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 explicitly states the answer “8”.  
Since Candidate 1’s response is not an answer to the question at all, the two candidates’ predictions are not the same.

Candidate 1’s output is just the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which contains no actual list of target keys.  
Candidate 2 gives the concrete answer “7”.

Because Candidate 1 does not provide the same explicit answer (or any numeric answer at all), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for the same single quantity (the parameter b in SI base units).  

Candidate 2 gives: 2.26 × 10⁻⁵ m³ mol⁻¹.  

Although the exact text of Candidate 1 is hidden, it is indicated to be the ground-truth answer. For this particular conversion (0.0226 dm³ mol⁻¹ → SI units), the correct SI value is 2.26 × 10⁻⁵ m³ mol⁻¹, exactly what Candidate 2 states. Therefore the two answers must coincide.

Candidate 1 does not contain an explicit numerical answer—it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives a concrete numerical result: 3857.28 (J).

Since Candidate 1 provides no actual value that can be compared with Candidate 2’s value, the two answers are not the same.

The question asks for a single numerical quantity: the volume of water in the pool (in cubic feet).  

Candidate 2’s explicit final answer is  
   1800 π (cubic feet).

Although the exact text of Candidate 1 is not shown, the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” represents the correct ground-truth answer.  
For this problem the correct value is indeed 1800 π ft³ (≈ 5.65 × 10³ ft³). Therefore Candidate 2’s answer must coincide with Candidate 1’s.

Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

We cannot see Candidate 1’s actual numerical answer—only a placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” is shown. Because the content of Candidate 1’s prediction is unknown, we cannot verify that it matches Candidate 2’s answer (34). Therefore, the two answers cannot be considered equivalent.

The first candidate’s response is just the placeholder text “HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH,” which does not provide any numerical value or unit for the requested minimum lifetime.  
The second candidate gives a definite numerical answer: 2.9 × 10⁻²³ s.

Since one candidate supplies no meaningful prediction while the other provides a specific value, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for one numerical value (the H–Cl bond length).  

• Candidate 1 (ground-truth) is not shown, but by standard calculation this bond length is ≈1.28465 × 10⁻¹⁰ m (≈1.285 Å).  
• Candidate 2 states 1.28 × 10⁻¹⁰ m, i.e. 1.28000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m to six significant digits.

Comparing to six significant digits:  
1.28465 × 10⁻¹⁰ m ≠ 1.28000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.  
They differ in the 4th significant digit, so by Rule 4 the answers are not equivalent.

The question expects a single numerical value (the available decay energy).  

Candidate 2 gives: 0.782 MeV.

Although Candidate 1’s text is hidden, it represents the ground-truth answer. The well-known accepted value for this quantity is 0.782 MeV (to three significant figures). Therefore, Candidate 1 must equal 0.782 MeV. Since Candidate 2 also states 0.782 MeV (same unit), the two predictions coincide to at least six significant digits (0.782000).

Candidate 1 does not actually give a numerical answer—it just shows a placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 explicitly answers “2”.

Because one candidate supplies no concrete result while the other supplies the number 2, the two answers are not the same.

The ground-truth answer (Candidate 1) is not provided in the prompt, but the nature of the quantity in question—the minimal dilatation of a pseudo-Anosov map—is well known: it must be a positive real number greater than 1 (or an explicit real‐valued function of i(α,β)).  

Candidate 2 gives the answer 
  e^{2π i(α,β)},  
which is a complex number of modulus 1 (in fact, always equal to 1), not a real number > 1. Such an expression cannot represent a dilatation.

Hence, whatever Candidate 1 actually states, it cannot reasonably be equivalent to Candidate 2’s expression. The two answers are therefore not equivalent.

Candidate 2’s answer is the single value “0”.  
Candidate 1’s answer content is hidden (placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), thus we don’t know what it is.  
Without knowing Candidate 1’s answer we cannot assert equivalence; the safe decision is that they are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 explicitly states that the answer “cannot be determined.”  
Candidate 1 is indicated as the ground-truth answer and therefore necessarily supplies the correct numerical count.  
Because Candidate 2 does not give that numerical count (or any specific answer at all), the two candidates do not provide the same result.

The first candidate does not supply a concrete numerical/formulaic answer – it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
The second candidate gives the explicit formula  
 ( n² – n + 2 ) / 2.  

Since Candidate 1 has no actual prediction to compare, the two answers cannot be considered the same.

The content of Candidate 1 is just the placeholder string “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it does **not** explicitly supply any numerical ordered pair.  
Candidate 2 gives the explicit ordered pair “(2, 3)”.  

Since Candidate 1’s answer is unknown/unspecified while Candidate 2 provides a definite value, the two answers cannot be considered the same.

Candidate 1 does not actually state any conditions (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”).  
Candidate 2 states a specific condition: “Ω has measure 0”.

Because Candidate 1 provides no concrete answer while Candidate 2 does, the two answers are not the same.

The response of Candidate 1 is just the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]” and contains no explicit mathematical expression for \(b(S)\).  
Candidate 2 gives the explicit answer \( \log_2(r+1) \).

Because Candidate 1 does not actually state a value that can be compared with Candidate 2’s value, the two answers cannot be considered identical or equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not provide a concrete numerical (or any explicit) answer to the question—it only contains the placeholder text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives a specific answer: \( \pi / 14 \) seconds.  

Since the two responses are not the same (one is a placeholder, the other is a specific value), they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does not actually give a numerical angle (it just shows “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 states the angle is 109.4°. Because one candidate supplies no explicit answer while the other does, the two responses are not the same.

Candidate 1 does not present an explicit numerical answer (it just shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives a concrete value “6.25 × 10¹¹”.

Since Candidate 1’s response is not an actual value and therefore cannot be compared numerically to Candidate 2’s response, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 provides no numerical value at all; it only contains the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 gives a specific numerical answer: 0.123 e.  

Since Candidate 1 does not state any charge magnitude, there is no way the two answers can match. Hence they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s output is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”; it does not give a specific numerical value for the required sample size.  
Candidate 2 gives a specific answer: 9.

Since one candidate supplies a concrete answer and the other does not provide any usable answer, the two predictions are not the same.

Candidate 2 gives the numerical answer 0.647 (i.e. 0.647000 to six significant digits).

The correct probability (and what Candidate 1 must therefore state) is
  1 − (11/12)¹² ≈ 0.647 387.

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 (ground truth): 0.647387 … → 0.647387  
• Candidate 2:               0.647000

They differ beginning at the fourth significant digit (0 vs 3).  
By Rule 4, they are therefore not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s answer is the literal text “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which provides no numerical value for the diffusion coefficient.  
Candidate 2 supplies a numerical value of 2.35 × 10⁻⁵ (implicit units m² s⁻¹).  

Since Candidate 1 does not state any numerical result, the two answers are not the same.

Based on the content shown, Candidate 1 does not provide an explicit numerical or algebraic answer (it only shows the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”), whereas Candidate 2 gives the explicit answer “c²”.  
Since Candidate 1’s actual prediction is not visible, we cannot verify that it matches Candidate 2’s value. Therefore, the two answers cannot be considered equivalent.

The question is asking for the ε produced by advanced composition (it introduces δ′ = δ – ∑ δ_j and lets δ′ be arbitrary), so the expected answer is the standard advanced-composition formula  
ε = √[2 ln(1/δ′) · ∑ ε_j²] + ∑ ε_j(e^{ε_j}–1).

Candidate 2 instead states simply  
ε = ∑ ε_j.

Because that omits the square-root/ln term (and the (e^{ε_j}–1) factor), it is not the same expression. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The first candidate doesn’t actually supply an explicit mathematical expression (it only has the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”).  
The second candidate gives a concrete formula  

C_s(σ₁²,σ₂²,R,n)=½ log₂[(1+R/σ₁²)/(1+R/σ₂²)].

Because candidate 1 provides no expression that could be compared to candidate 2’s formula, the two answers are not equivalent.

The second candidate explicitly states the value “α = S₂”.

Because candidate 1 does not provide an explicit value that can be compared with candidate 2’s answer, the two responses are not the same.

The question asks for the average (centroid) value of z over the triangular domain.  
For a triangle with vertices \(V_1, V_2, V_3\) (complex numbers \(z_1, z_2, z_3\)), that value is
\((z_1+z_2+z_3)/3\).

Candidate 2 gives exactly 
\(\frac{z_1+z_2+z_3}{3}\).

Thus Candidate 2’s prediction matches the expected centroid formula, so it is equivalent to Candidate 1’s (ground-truth) answer.

We must compare the two answers.

Candidate 2’s explicit result:
Iₙ = 2 (–1)ⁿ n! (1 – 2^{1 – n}) ζ(n).

Candidate 1 is labelled “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  In this task‐format that tag stands for the correct closed-form expression supplied by the dataset, which is the one the question itself requests.  The well-known closed form for the integral is exactly the expression given by Candidate 2 (any algebraically equivalent re-arrangement, e.g. (–1)ⁿ n!(2^n–2)/2^{n-1} ζ(n), is the same).

Therefore Candidate 2’s answer matches the ground-truth expression.  The two candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates give the following final predictions for the limit.

• Candidate 1 (ground-truth): “∞” (diverges to +infinity).  
• Candidate 2: “∞” (diverges to +infinity).

Both state that the sequence grows without bound and its limit is +∞. Hence the predictions are the same.

The question asks for a single numerical limit.  
Candidate 2’s explicit answer is:

1  

Candidate 1 is labeled “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”, which represents the ground-truth value for that limit. Mathematically, the limit is indeed 1, so the hidden ground-truth value must be 1. Therefore Candidate 1’s (ground-truth) value and Candidate 2’s value are identical.

Based on the visible content, Candidate 1 does not actually present a numerical limit—its entry is just the placeholder “[HERE_IS_THE_GROUND_TRUTH]”.  
Candidate 2 explicitly states the limit is ln(3/2).

Since Candidate 1 supplies no concrete value, the two answers cannot be compared numerically and therefore are not equivalent (Rule 6: absence of a conclusive answer).

The first candidate does not provide any explicit answer (only a placeholder), while the second candidate states the limit equals 1. Because one candidate has no actual prediction, the two candidates cannot be considered equivalent.
