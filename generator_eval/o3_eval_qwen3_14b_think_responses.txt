The question asks for a single element of the Grothendieck-Witt ring \(\GW(\mathbb{F}_q)\).

• Candidate 1 gives \(\dfrac12\binom{2j}{j}\,(1+u)\).

• Candidate 2 gives just \(j\).

Interpreting both inside \(\GW(\mathbb{F}_q)=\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}/2\):
 – Candidate 1 has rank \(\binom{2j}{j}\) (since \((1+u)\) has rank 2) and a non-trivial \(u\)-component.
 – Candidate 2 has rank \(j\) and no \(u\)-component.

Unless \(j=0\) (in which case the question degenerates to the trivial situation), these two elements are different in both rank and discriminant component. The problem statement treats \(j\) as an arbitrary non-negative integer, so the answers must agree for all \(j\). They do not.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
Both candidates agree on the density for the case γ ∈ (0,1].

For γ > 1 they differ:

• Candidate 1: puts weight 1 − 1/γ at 0 and uses the density f_{1/γ}(x) (i.e. the Marčenko–Pastur density with parameter 1/γ).  
  → Support becomes [(1 − 1/√γ)², (1 + 1/√γ)²], which is not the true support for parameter γ.

• Candidate 2: puts weight 1 − 1/γ at 0 and says the “same density” as before, i.e. f_γ(x) with support [(√γ − 1)², (√γ + 1)²].  
  → This is the correct description.

Thus the two answers give different continuous parts (different support and different formula) when γ > 1, so the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas for the same single quantity.

• Candidate 1: explicit closed‐form formula ⌊n²/4⌋ + 1.  
• Candidate 2: recurrence a(n)=a(n−1)+a(n−2)+a(n−3) with a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=3.

Evaluating both at n=4:  
– Candidate 1 ⇒ ⌊16/4⌋+1 = 4+1 = 5.  
– Candidate 2 ⇒ 3+2+1 = 6.

Since they yield different values, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the closed-form formula ⌊n²/4⌋ + 1.  
Candidate 2 claims the answer follows the Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …) or a similar sequence, explicitly stating uncertainty and giving early terms 1, 2, 3, 6,… .

These two proposed sequences/formulas are clearly different and cannot be converted into each other. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give closed-form counts, but their formulas are different.

• Candidate 1’s denominator is the product of factorials of the numbers of vertices of each out-degree:  d₀! d₁! d₂! …

• Candidate 2’s denominator is the product of factorials of the out-degrees themselves, each raised to the power dᵢ:  ∏_{i≥0}(i!)^{dᵢ}.

These two denominators are not generally equal.  
For a valid tree with d₀ = 1, d₁ = 2 (a path of length 3, so n = 3),

 Candidate 1 gives (3 − 1)! / (1! · 2!) = 2/2 = 1,  
 Candidate 2 gives (3 − 1)! / [(0!)¹(1!)²] = 2/1 = 2.

Hence the two candidates yield different counts, so they are not equivalent.

The question requests three separate formulas for q, each expressed in terms of n, i, k (and in part 3, distinguishing odd versus even k).

Candidate 1 supplies:

1. q = k^{n+2-i}  
2. q = k^{n+1-i}  
3. q = k^{n+2-i} (odd k) or ½ k^{n+2-i} (even k)

Candidate 2 supplies:

1. q = k  
2. q = k^{i}  
3. q = k^{i} (odd k) or 0 (even k)

The two sets of formulas are plainly different for every case (different powers of k, different dependence on n and i, different even/odd cases). Therefore, per Rule 2 (all sub-answers must agree) and Rule 6 (mathematical mismatch), the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give fundamentally different sets of palindromes.

• Candidate 1 supplies a finite explicit list: {1, 2, 3, 22, 212, 232, 12321, 32123}.  
• Candidate 2 claims the complete set consists of all palindromes made entirely of 1’s except for a single central 2, of length 2ⁿ − 1 (n ≥ 1); this is an infinite family and, for example, includes “121” but never “22”, “3”, “232”, etc.

Because the two answers describe different collections (they disagree on which palindromes can appear), they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the value 4 / (3 π) ≈ 0.424413  
Candidate 2 gives the value 7 / 15 ≈ 0.466667  

Comparing to six significant digits:  
0.424413 ≠ 0.466667

  (essentially an expression growing like n·2^{n})

• Candidate 2: |DPCₙ| = Catalanₙ = (1/(n+1))·C(2n,n)  
  (grows asymptotically like 4^{n}/n^{3/2})

These have entirely different functional forms and cannot be algebraically equivalent. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a single piece-wise formula  
aw = 4 when (n is even AND diameter is odd),  
aw = 3 otherwise.

Candidate 2 lists two different, mutually inconsistent formulas:
• “answer 1”: aw = 2 if n even, 3 if n odd.  
• “answer 2”: aw = 2 if diameter even, 3 if diameter odd.

Thus Candidate 2 does not match Candidate 1 for any general setting; even for the case (n even & diameter odd) Candidate 1 says 4 while Candidate 2’s two lines would give 2 and 3 respectively. The answers are clearly different, and Candidate 2 even contains conflicting statements within itself.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different formulae for both parts of the representation.

• Homogeneous part  
  – C1: Σ_{j=0}^{n₀−1} e_j v_j(t) (upper index n₀−1).  
  – C2: Σ_{j=0}^{m} c_j v_j(t) (upper index m).  
  Because n₀ (depending on Re β₀) need not equal m (number of σ_i), the sums are generally over different numbers of canonical solutions.

• Particular part  
  – C1: an explicit Neumann-series-type expression: V_h(t)=Σ_{k=0}^{∞} (-1)^k I_{α,β₀,ω}^{θ₀} ( Σ_{i=1}^{m} σ_i(t) I_{α,β₀−β_i,ω}^{θ₀−θ_i} )^{k} g(t).  
  – C2: a simple single-operator form V_h(t)= I_{α,β,ω}^{θ} h(t).  
  These are not the same operator expression.

Since both the homogeneous and the particular parts differ, the two answers are not equivalent under the rules.

The question requires one piecewise expression with two cases:  
1) when a = d and b = c,  
2) otherwise.

Candidate 1 provides exactly that, giving  
• a non-zero formula (involving (–1)^b and factorials) for the first case,  
• 0 for the second case.

Candidate 2 lists “*answer 1: 0” and “*answer 2: (2π²/(2a+2b+1))((a+b)!/(a! b!))²”, but never states which answer corresponds to which condition, nor does it match Candidate 1’s non-zero formula (it contains π² and no (–1)^b factor). The two expressions differ structurally and numerically.

Hence the two candidates are not giving the same results for any of the cases.

The two candidates give the same quantity.

Candidate 1:
[z^{n}](φ(z))^{k} = (k/n) [z^{n-1}]( z^{k-1} R(z)^{n} ).

Because z^{k-1} is just a monomial factor,  
[z^{n-1}]( z^{k-1} R(z)^{n} ) = [z^{\,n-1-(k-1)}] R(z)^{n} = [z^{\,n-k}] R(z)^{n}.

Candidate 2 already writes the result as (k/n) [w^{n-k}] R(w)^{n}.

Thus both candidates give (k/n) · coefficient of z^{n-k} in R(z)^{n}. They are equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions for the derivative:

\[
\frac{n-\mathbf{p}+1}{q}\int_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} h_L^{\,q}(\xi)\,h_K^{\,1-q}(\xi)\,d\mu_K(\xi).
\]

• Candidate 2:  
\[
\int_{\partial K} h_L^{\,q}\,h_K^{\,\mathbf{p}-1}\,d\mu_K.
\]

Differences:

1. Prefactor: Candidate 1 has \((n-\mathbf{p}+1)/q\); Candidate 2 has none.
2. Power of \(h_K\): Candidate 1 uses \(h_K^{\,1-q}\); Candidate 2 uses \(h_K^{\,\mathbf{p}-1}\).
3. Domain of integration: sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\) vs boundary \(\partial K\).
4. Possible mismatch of the measure’s definition in each integral.

Because the integrals and factors do not match, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different groups in several sub-cases.

• For case (ii) with even d, Candidate 1 gives S_{(d/2+1)} wr ℤ₂ (order 2·((d/2+1)!)²), whereas Candidate 2 gives the dihedral group D_{d+2} (order 2(d+2)). These are not isomorphic for general d.

• For case (ii) with odd d, Candidate 1 gives S_{⌈n/2⌉} × S_{⌊n/2⌋}, while Candidate 2 says the group is trivial.

• For case (iii) with odd d, Candidate 1 gives ℤ₂ × ℤ₂, while Candidate 2 again says the group is trivial.

Since there are discrepancies in multiple required sub-cases, the two predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: “f(x,y) = 0”.  
• Candidate 2: “0” (implicitly the same statement that the function equals zero).

There is only one required answer, and both give the same value with no unit or type discrepancy. Hence the answers are equivalent.

Both answers supply values for all six requested parameters (v, k, λ₁, λ₂, m, n), so we compare each component.  
The expressions in Candidate 1 (fractions and high-degree polynomials in q) are completely different from the much simpler monomials given in Candidate 2. None of the corresponding components match algebraically or numerically. Therefore the two sets of parameters are not the same.

The two expressions are plainly different mathematical objects.

• Candidate 1 is a q-Pochhammer symbol
 (−q^r ; ε q^{r+t+s})_∞ = ∏_{k=0}^{∞} (1 + ε^{k} q^{r + k(r+t+s)}).

• Candidate 2 is the infinite product
 ∏_{n=1}^{∞} (1 − q^{n} + ε q^{s+n}).

Even for particular choices of the parameters (e.g. r = 1, t = 0, s = 0, ε = 1) they give completely different results (Candidate 1 becomes ∏_{k=0}^{∞}(1+q^{1+k}), whereas Candidate 2 collapses to 1). Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give explicit but entirely different formulas for both \(\gamma^{all}_{0,\min}\) and \(\gamma^{all}_{0,\max}\).

• Candidate 1:
\[
\gamma^{all}_{0,\min}=\frac{k+s}{(s+1)k}+\frac{s^{2}(k+r)}{(r-1)(s+1)k},\qquad
\gamma^{all}_{0,\max}=\gamma^{all}_{0,\min}+\frac{r-1}{4k(k+r)(s+1)}.
\]

• Candidate 2:
\[
\gamma^{all}_{0,\min}=\frac{k-s+1}{k},\qquad
\gamma^{all}_{0,\max}=\frac{k+r-s+1}{k}.
\]

The expressions differ in structure, denominators, and dependence on the parameters \(s\) and \(r\). They cannot be algebraically equal for all \(k,s,r\). Hence, under Rule 2/Rule 8 the answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: c² / (σ₁² + σ₂²)

A logarithmic function and a rational algebraic function are not generally equal; there is no algebraic identity that makes these two expressions coincide for arbitrary σ₁², σ₂², and c (except possibly in special limiting cases, which is not sufficient for overall equivalence).

Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

 ⇒ value = a^{4}.

• Candidate 2:  
(1/(1+1))·(a^{3}+a^{4}) = (a^{3}+a^{4})/2.

Because a^{4} ≠ (a^{3}+a^{4})/2 for general a, the two expressions are unequal (except in degenerate cases such as t = 0). Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two formulas are structurally very different.

Candidate 1  
 ∑_{i=1}^{m-1} (1 − ρ_i(g)) / (1 − μ̂(ρ_i))

• excludes the trivial character (i = 0);  
• numerator is (1 − ρ_i(g));  
• no overall factor of 1/m.

Candidate 2  
 (1/m) ∑_{i=0}^{m-1} ρ_i(g) / (1 − μ̂(ρ_i))

• includes the i = 0 term (where the denominator 1 − μ̂(ρ_0)=0, making the term undefined);  
• numerator is ρ_i(g) (no “1 −”);  
• multiplies by an overall factor 1/m.

Because of these differences the two expressions cannot coincide in general (indeed the i=0 term in Candidate 2 is singular). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not equivalent.

Reasoning:
• Candidate 1’s formula depends only on q and r: ½ · C(2q, r).
• Candidate 2’s formula depends on K as well as q and r: C(K, r) – C(K – q, r).

Since the value of Candidate 2 changes when K changes (for fixed q and r) while Candidate 1 is completely independent of K, the two cannot be identical for arbitrary K. An identity that is independent of K on one side and dependent on K on the other side cannot hold for all possible K. Therefore the predictions are different.

The question asks for a single numerical‐valued expression (in terms of \(q\)-binomial coefficients) giving the maximum cardinality.  
• Candidate 1 gives a sum over many \(q\)-binomial terms indexed by \(\ell\) satisfying a congruence condition.  
• Candidate 2 gives the single \(q\)-binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{t}_{q}\).

These two expressions are clearly different functions of \(n\), \(t\), and \(q\) (e.g., for \(t=1\) they evaluate to \(\sum_{k}\binom{n}{2k}_{q}\) versus \(\binom{n}{1}_{q}\)), so they cannot be equivalent answers to the same question.

The two answers give different algebraic expressions:

Candidate 1: C₁ = (1 − 1/N)  / (1 − 1/N^{K/D})

Candidate 2: C₂ = K / (N D) = (K/D)/N

In general, these are not the same function of N, K, D. For example, taking K = 2D (so K/D = 2) and any N ≥ 2,

C₁ = (N − 1)/(1 − N^{−2}) = N²/(N+1) while C₂ = 2/N.

Since N²/(N+1) ≠ 2/N (e.g., for N = 2: 4/3 ≠ 1), the two expressions are not equal. Therefore the predictions are inequivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions give different numerical values in general.  
Example: for n = 1  
• Candidate 1: ⌈2√1⌉ = ⌈2⌉ = 2  
• Candidate 2: ⌈(1+√(1+12·1))/2⌉ = ⌈(1+√13)/2⌉ ≈ ⌈2.30278⌉ = 3  

Because the ceilings differ already at n = 1, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

Candidate 1: ⌈2√n⌉  
Candidate 2: ⌈1 + 2√n⌉ = ⌈2√n⌉ + 1  (since adding an integer inside the ceiling shifts the ceiling up by exactly 1)

Hence Candidate 2 is always exactly one larger than Candidate 1 for every positive integer n.  
They are therefore not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: \(k = \bigl\lceil\log_{p}(1/\xi)\bigr\rceil\).

These functions of \(\xi\) and \(p\) are plainly not algebraically equal (Candidate 1 grows astronomically faster than Candidate 2). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates describe the same object.

• Candidate 1 gives the standard minimax formula  
  val(ini) = sup_σ inf_τ E^{σ,τ}_ini = inf_τ sup_σ E^{σ,τ}_ini,  
which is exactly the expected payoff when each player uses an optimal strategy.

• Candidate 2 states in words that val(ini) is “the expected payoff when both players employ their optimal strategies, starting from the initial distribution ini.”

The verbal description in Candidate 2 conveys the same concept as the formal minimax expression in Candidate 1. No additional distinct pieces of information are required, and there is no contradiction between the two.

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same closed-form expression

for p≠0.  

Candidate 2 additionally states the limiting value at p=0,
 I(0)= –π²/12,  
which is exactly the limit of Candidate 1’s formula as p→0.  
Thus Candidate 1’s answer (interpreted with that limit, as the problem requests) and Candidate 2’s answer describe the same function.

• Candidate 2: Γ(s) G_{1,2}^{1,1}\!\left(a\;\Big|\begin{smallmatrix}1\\0,\,1-s\end{smallmatrix}\right)

They have different orders of the Meijer G function, different parameter lists, different arguments (a versus a²/4), and different prefactors (1/4π^{3/2} versus Γ(s)). There is no evident transformation that makes these expressions identical.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

4. An overall prefactor 1/(4 π^{3/2}) present only in Candidate 1.

Such markedly different Meijer-G forms (with different parameters and scaling) cannot be identical without additional identities, and none are indicated. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single real‐number result for the double integral.

Candidate 1: π ≈ 3.14159 …

Candidate 2: π [erf(eᵉ)]².  
For x = eᵉ ≈ 15.1543, erf(x)=1−O(e^{−x²}).  Since e^{−(eᵉ)²}=e^{−229.65…}≈1.9 × 10^{−100},  
erf(eᵉ)=0.99999 … 9 (the first 99 decimal places are 9’s).  
Thus [erf(eᵉ)]² differs from 1 only at the ~10^{−100} level, so

π [erf(eᵉ)]² = π (1 ± 10^{−100}) = 3.14159 … with agreement to far more than 6 significant digits.

According to Rule 4, two numerical answers are considered the same if they coincide to 6 significant digits.  
π and π [erf(eᵉ)]² coincide to many more than 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates set their left‐hand side equal to π/2; the only possible difference is in how the left‐hand side is written.

Recall the trigonometric identity  
sin(arccos θ) = √(1 – θ²).

Take θ = 1 – c.

Then  
sin(arccos(1 – c)) = √(1 – (1 – c)²) = √(1 – (1 – 2c + c²)) = √(2c – c²).

Candidate 1 left side:  
(1 – c)(π – arccos(1 – c)) + sin(arccos(1 – c))

⇨ (1 – c)(π – arccos(1 – c)) + √(2c – c²),

which is exactly Candidate 2 left side:  
√(2c – c²) + (π – arccos(1 – c))(1 – c).

Thus the two equations are algebraically identical.

Both answers state that the limit is the (single) real number that satisfies the fixed-point equation cos(z) = z. Candidate 1 calls it α and also supplies an approximate decimal value; Candidate 2 calls it c and omits the approximation. Because both refer to the exact same uniquely defined real constant, the two predictions are mathematically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates both state that the limit equals the unique fixed‐point of the cosine function.

• Candidate 1: “α is the unique real solution of cos α = α (approximately 0.739085).”  
• Candidate 2: “0.7390851332151607”.

Comparing their numerical values to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
– Candidate 1: 0.739085  
– Candidate 2: 0.7390851332151607 → 0.739085 (first 6 significant digits).

They match. Candidate 1’s additional descriptive wording does not change the result. Hence the answers are equivalent.

• ln(2 + √3) ≈ ln(3.7320508) ≈ 1.316957  
  ⇒ Candidate 1 ≈ π × 1.316957 / 6 ≈ 3.141593 × 1.316957 / 6 ≈ 0.689040

• ln 2 ≈ 0.693147  
  ⇒ Candidate 2 ≈ π × 0.693147 / 4 ≈ 3.141593 × 0.693147 / 4 ≈ 0.544395

0.689040 ≠ 0.544395 (they differ already in the first three significant figures), so the two answers are numerically different. By Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1:  (ln² a − ln² b) / [2 (a − b)]
  = [(ln a − ln b)(ln a + ln b)] / [2 (a − b)]
  = [ln(a/b) · ln(ab)] / [2 (a − b)].

Candidate 2:  ln(b/a) / (a − b)
  = −ln(a/b) / (a − b).

Thus
 Candidate 1 = (−½ ln (ab)) · Candidate 2.

Since −½ ln (ab) is generally not the constant 1 (it depends on a and b), the two answers differ for almost all positive distinct a, b. Hence they are not equivalent.

Both expressions can be rewritten to show they match:

Candidate 1  
V = (16 π / 3)(1 − 1/√2)  
  = (16 π / 3) · (√2 − 1)/√2  
  = (16/√2)(π/3)(√2 − 1)  
  = (8√2)(π/3)(√2 − 1)  
  = (8π / 3)(2 − √2).

Candidate 2 is already (8 π / 3)(2 − √2).

Since they are exactly the same algebraic expression (and thus the same numerical value and unit), the two candidates are equivalent.

The problem has two sub-questions (one value for the integral and one for the double sum).  
• Candidate 1 supplies only a single number “\( \tfrac{5\pi^{2}}{12} \)”, giving just one answer.  
• Candidate 2 supplies two answers, explicitly labeling them “answer 1” and “answer 2”, each equal to \( \tfrac{5\pi^{2}}{12} \).

Since Candidate 1 gives fewer answers than required, while Candidate 2 gives two answers, the responses are not equivalent according to Rule 2.

The two candidates give different functional forms:

• Candidate 1: \(e^{-az}\,H_0^{(1)}(z)=e^{-az}\,[J_0(z)+iY_0(z)]\)

• Candidate 2: \(\pi\,e^{az}\,J_0(z)\)

They differ in

1. An overall factor ( \(e^{-az}\) vs \( \pi e^{az}\) ).
2. Presence of the Neumann–Bessel part \(iY_0(z)\) in Candidate 1, absent in Candidate 2.

Since these expressions are not the same (even up to a constant factor) for general positive \(a,z\), the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give

1. e^{-az} H₀^{(1)}(z)

2. π e^{-az} J₀(z)

After the common factor e^{-az} is factored out, they differ by the special-function factor:

• H₀^{(1)}(z) = J₀(z) + i Y₀(z)  (Hankel function of the first kind)

• π J₀(z) is simply π times the Bessel J function and has no Y₀ component.

Because H₀^{(1)}(z) is not equal to π J₀(z) (it contains the additional imaginary Bessel Y part and no constant π factor), the two expressions are not the same.

Hence the two candidate answers are inequivalent.

Both expressions represent the same numerical value:

• Starting with Candidate 2:  

 sin(π/5) = sin 36° = √[(5 – √5)/8]  
 ⇒ 1/sin(π/5) = √[8/(5 – √5)]

 So Candidate 2 = 5π · √[8/(5 – √5)] = 10√2 π / √(5 – √5).

• Candidate 1 is π·√[10(√5 + 5)] = π √10 √(√5 + 5).

Square both sides (without π):

 L² = 10(√5 + 5)  
 R² = (10√2 / √(5 – √5))² = 200/(5 – √5)

But (√5 + 5)(5 – √5) = 20, so  

 10(√5 + 5)(5 – √5) = 10·20 = 200 ⇒ L² = R².

Hence the two candidates are exactly equal.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different closed-form expressions:

 (depends on m through the Gamma arguments and is non-zero for general m)

• Candidate 2:  K(z,m)=2^{z} √π  Γ(z+½)/Γ(½−z) · 2π δ_{m,0}  
 (non-zero only when m=0 because of the δ_{m,0} factor and has a completely different Gamma structure)

The two formulas differ in their dependence on m, in their overall multiplicative factors, and they do not agree even for m=0 (numeric check shows different values). Hence they are not equivalent.

The two candidates both give the value  
ln 3 − ¼ (Candidate 2 writes it explicitly, Candidate 1 writes log 3 − ¼, where “log” in pure-mathematics notation ordinarily denotes the natural logarithm).  
Since both expressions represent the same real number, the answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same algebraic expression except for the logarithm notation:

• Candidate 1:  log(3) − 1/4  
• Candidate 2:  ln(3) − 1/4  

In standard mathematical usage (especially in calculus and analysis, the context of this problem), “log” without an explicit base denotes the natural logarithm, the same function written as “ln.” Hence log(3) = ln(3).

Since the subtraction term −1/4 is identical in both answers, the two candidates represent the identical numerical value.

Candidate 2 gives the result  
 Γ(z) i^{\,z}.

Using the principal branch of the complex logarithm, i = e^{iπ/2}, so  
 i^{\,z} = e^{z ln i} = e^{z (iπ/2)} = e^{+iπz/2}.

Hence Γ(z) i^{\,z} = Γ(z) e^{+iπz/2}, which differs from Γ(z) e^{-iπz/2} by complex conjugation (the sign in the exponent is opposite). These expressions are not the same for general z (they coincide only for very special values of z), so the two candidates are inequivalent.

Both candidates provide a single expression for \(B(t)\).  
Candidate 1: \(B(t)=\exp\!\bigl(\int_{0}^{t} r_s\,ds\bigr)\)  
Candidate 2: \(B(t)=\exp\!\bigl(\int_{0}^{t} r_\tau\,d\tau\bigr)\)

The integration variable \(s\) versus \(\tau\) is a dummy variable, so the two formulas are mathematically identical. Hence the answers are equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

• Candidate 1: π / [α sin(π α)]

• Candidate 2: π / [α sin(π α)] − 1/α²

The second expression subtracts an extra term, 1/α², which is non-zero for every α in the interval (0, 1). Therefore the two answers cannot be the same.

The two candidates give different formulas.

1. Overall sign: Candidate 1 has an overall factor “− c”, whereas Candidate 2 has “+ c”.
2. Argument of J₀:  
   • Candidate 1:  kc √[ τ² − (R/c)² ] (square root present)  
   • Candidate 2:  kc [ τ² − (R/c)² ]  (no square root)

Because the arguments of the Bessel function differ (presence vs. absence of a square root) and the overall signs differ, the two expressions are not mathematically equivalent.

The two expressions differ only in the power of \((-1)\):

Candidate 1: \((-1)^{\,n-1}\dfrac{2}{2n-1}\)

Candidate 2: \((-1)^{\,n+1}\dfrac{2}{2n-1}\)

Since
\[
(-1)^{\,n+1}=(-1)^{\,n-1}\,(-1)^{\,2}=(-1)^{\,n-1}\times 1 = (-1)^{\,n-1},
\]
the two candidates give exactly the same value for every integer \(n\).

The value of cos⁻¹(2/3) ≈ 0.8410686736 radians.  
Converting this to degrees: 0.8410686736 rad × (180 / π) ≈ 48.189685°.

Candidate 1 gives 48.189685°, which matches the degree equivalent of Candidate 2’s expression.  
After unit conversion, the two answers are identical to at least six significant digits.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 1.4907.  
Candidate 2 gives the exact expression \(\dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}\).

Numerically,
\(\dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{3} \approx 1.490712\).

Expressing both answers to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 1.490700  
• Candidate 2: 1.490712  

They differ at the 6th significant digit (…700 vs …712).  
According to Rule 4, the two answers must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent; they do not.

The two candidates give the same numerical information, just expressed through the reciprocal quantities “period” and “frequency.”

• Candidate 1: 0.7854 s  → frequency = 1 / 0.7854 s ≈ 1.273236 Hz  
• Candidate 2: 4/π Hz ≈ 1.273240 Hz  

After converting one to the same physical quantity as the other (using f = 1/T), the two values agree to at least six significant digits (1.27323 Hz). Hence the predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical times:

• Candidate 1: 0.2244 s → 0.224400 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: π/14 s ≈ 0.224399 s → 0.224399 (to six significant digits)

Comparing the six significant digits, 0.224400 differs from 0.224399 at the 4th–6th digits. Therefore they do not match to six significant digits and are not equivalent.

The answers are numerical dollar amounts.

Candidate 1: 3930 $  
Candidate 2: 3929.68 $

Expressing both with six significant digits and the same exponent:

Candidate 1 → 3.93000 × 10³  
Candidate 2 → 3.92968 × 10³

They differ at the third significant digit (3.93000 vs 3.92968), so they do NOT match to six significant digits.

Both candidates give a single time value, but in different units.

• Convert Candidate 1 to minutes:
7.136 h × 60 min/h = 428.160 min.

• Candidate 2 already states 428.13 min.

Compare the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

428.160 vs 428.130 → they differ in the 5th significant digit (…160 vs …130).

Since the values are not identical to 6 significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reasoning:
1. Numerical comparison to 6 significant digits:
   • Candidate 1: 0.0408000  
   • Candidate 2: 0.0408163  
    
   They differ beginning at the 5th significant digit, so they are not the same value.

2. Units:
   • Candidate 1 gives no unit.  
   • Candidate 2 specifies “kg/m”.  

   The mismatch/omission of units adds further inequivalence.

Hence the answers are different.

The two candidates give the acceleration in different units:  

• Candidate 1: 83.81 m/s²  
• Candidate 2: 5.44 g  

Convert Candidate 2 to m/s²: 5.44 g ≈ 5.44 × 9.8 m/s² ≈ 53.3 m/s².  

Compare to Candidate 1’s 83.81 m/s²: the values differ significantly (83.81 ≠ 53.3).  
Or, in g-units, Candidate 1 corresponds to 83.81 / 9.8 ≈ 8.55 g, whereas Candidate 2 is 5.44 g.

Since the numerical answers are not equal, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 1.4 × 10³ kg m⁻³  = 1400 kg m⁻³.  
Candidate 2 gives 1444.444… kg m⁻³.

Comparing the numerical values to six significant digits:
• 1400 kg m⁻³  → 1.40000 × 10³  
• 1444.444 kg m⁻³ → 1.44444 × 10³  

Since 1.40000 ≠ 1.44444, the two answers are not the same.

• Candidate 2: “4.16 × 10⁴²”.

Interpreting Candidate 1 as 4.16 × 10^{42}, both answers are identical to at least six significant digits with the same exponent, giving the same dimensionless ratio.

The two answers are numerical values that should be compared to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

• Candidate 1: 3.07 × 10²¹

• Candidate 2: 3.09 × 10²¹  
  → expressed to 6 sig. digits: 3.09000 × 10²¹

Since 3.07000 × 10²¹ ≠ 3.09000 × 10²¹ at 6 significant digits, the two predictions are not the same.  
(The omitted unit in Candidate 2 does not rescue equivalence, because even after assuming the same unit, the numerical values differ.)

The two candidates differ in their treatment of units.

• Candidate 1 gives “2.7 10^6” with no unit specified.  
• Candidate 2 gives “2.7 × 10⁶ m/s,” explicitly stating the unit.

Because the question asks for a speed and speed can reasonably be expressed in various units (m/s, cm/s, km/s, etc.), omitting the unit introduces ambiguity under Rule 1. Therefore the two answers are not considered equivalent.

The question asks for “the $x$ coordinate of particle 3.”  
It requires a single numerical location (one answer).

Candidate 1 supplies one value:
• 2.72 L

Candidate 2 supplies two distinct values:
• (5 + √10)/3 L  ≈ 2.72076 L  
• (5 – √10)/3 L  ≈ 0.61257 L

Thus Candidate 2 gives an extra position that Candidate 1 does not, and the two sets of answers are not identical.  
Because the number of answers differs and at least one of Candidate 2’s values (≈0.613 L) is not present in Candidate 1, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 supplies a single location: 2.72 L.

Candidate 2 supplies two distinct locations: (5 − √10)/3 L ≈ 0.613 L and (5 + √10)/3 L ≈ 2.721 L.

Thus Candidate 2 lists an additional coordinate that Candidate 1 does not give.  
Under Rule 2, if the problem requires more than one answer and a candidate gives fewer, the answers are not equivalent; likewise, giving extra distinct answers when only one is required also makes the two responses inequivalent. Therefore the two candidates’ predictions are not the same set of answers.

• Candidate 2: “8.99 × 10^9 N”.

Interpreting the space in Candidate 1 as the usual multiplication symbol in scientific notation, both correspond to 8.99000 × 10^9 N to six significant digits. Hence they are equivalent per Rule 4 (same value) and Rule 1 (same unit).

The minor formatting difference (missing explicit “×” in Candidate 1) does not introduce ambiguity in this context; it is clearly meant as scientific notation.

The two answers are numerical values in the same unit (newtons).

Convert to the same form with 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 8.87 × 10⁻¹⁵ N → 8.87000 × 10⁻¹⁵ N  
• Candidate 2: 8.88 × 10⁻¹⁵ N → 8.88000 × 10⁻¹⁵ N  

The mantissas (8.87000 vs 8.88000) differ at the 3rd significant digit, so they are not equal to 6 significant digits.

Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

• 6.25000 × 10¹¹

The question asks for a single numerical count (number of excess electrons).

Candidate 1: “2.00 10^{10} electrons;”  
Candidate 2: “2.00 × 10¹⁰”

Interpretation:
• Candidate 1 clearly intends scientific notation; the space is a typographical omission of the “×”.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly writes the scientific-notation “×”.

Both represent 2.00 × 10¹⁰, and both refer to the same unit (a count of electrons; Candidate 2’s unit is implicit from the question and unambiguous).

Thus the two answers are numerically identical and meet the same requirement of the problem.

The two answers are expressed in the same physical units after conversion:

• Candidate 1: 12 kJ = 12 000 J  
• Candidate 2: 13 480 J

Comparing to six significant digits gives 1.20000 × 10⁴ J vs. 1.34800 × 10⁴ J, which are different. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers give values for the same physical quantity (a length) but in different units.  

• Candidate 1: 0.42 pm  = 0.42 × 10⁻¹² m = 4.20000 × 10⁻¹³ m  
• Candidate 2: 4.1998 × 10⁻¹³ m  

Expressed with six significant digits, these are 4.20000 × 10⁻¹³ m and 4.19980 × 10⁻¹³ m.  
They differ already at the second significant digit (2 vs. 1), so they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give single numerical answers for the same quantity, but in different units.

−6420 J mol⁻¹ and −1770 J mol⁻¹ differ greatly (they do not match to six significant digits). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers express the melting point in different units, but after conversion they can be compared directly:

• Candidate 1: 272.8 K → 272.800 K  
  In °C: 272.8 K − 273.15 = −0.350 °C

• Candidate 2: −0.36 °C → −0.360 °C  
  In K: −0.36 °C + 273.15 = 272.790 K

Comparing either in Celsius (−0.350000 °C vs −0.360000 °C) or Kelvin (272.800000 K vs 272.790000 K), the values differ at the fifth significant digit; therefore they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

  226 pm = 226 × 10⁻¹² m = 2.26 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

• Candidate 2: 2.26 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

After conversion, both are 2.26 × 10⁻¹⁰ m, matching to at least six significant digits. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.

The two candidates give the same physical unit after conversion (wavenumber), but:

• Candidate 1: 82 258 cm⁻¹  = 8.2258 × 10⁶ m⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 8.23 × 10⁶ m⁻¹  (which is 8.23000 × 10⁶ m⁻¹ to six significant digits)

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

8.22580 ≠ 8.23000

Since the values do not match exactly to six significant digits, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers are both given as wavenumbers, but in different units:

• Candidate 1: 82258 cm⁻¹  
 → 82258 cm⁻¹ × (100 m⁻¹ per cm⁻¹) = 8.2258 × 10⁶ m⁻¹

• Candidate 2: 8.23 × 10⁶ m⁻¹

Expressed with six significant digits:
 Candidate 1: 8.22580 × 10⁶ m⁻¹  
 Candidate 2: 8.23000 × 10⁶ m⁻¹

Rule 4 requires the numbers to match to six significant digits.  
8.22580 ≠ 8.23000, so they do not match.

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both answers give the energy in different units, so we converted:

27 kcal mol⁻¹ → J per molecule  
27 kcal mol⁻¹ = 112 968 J mol⁻¹  
112 968 J mol⁻¹ ÷ (6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹) ≈ 1.8759 × 10⁻¹⁹ J molecule⁻¹

Candidate 2 supplies 1.874445 × 10⁻¹⁹ J.

Compare to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 in J per molecule: 1.87590×10⁻¹⁹  
• Candidate 2:               1.87445×10⁻¹⁹

Digits differ in the 4th–6th significant places, so they do NOT match to six significant digits.  
Equivalent comparison in kcal mol⁻¹ gives 27.0000 vs 26.9958—also a mismatch at the 4th significant digit.

Hence, despite being numerically very close, the candidates are not strictly equivalent under the rules.
The numeric value in Candidate 1 is “27 kcal /mol”.

Convert to joules:
27 kcal /mol × 4184 J /kcal = 1.13 × 10^5 J /mol.

For Candidate 2 we must decide whether the figure “1.874445 × 10^-19 J” is meant per molecule or per mole.  
• If we interpret it per mole, it is 1.9 × 10^-19 J /mol, which is 17 orders of magnitude smaller than Candidate 1.  
• If we interpret it per molecule and convert to per mole (multiply by Avogadro’s number), we obtain  

1.874445 × 10^-19 J × 6.022 × 10^23 mol^-1 = 1.13 × 10^5 J /mol  
→ 26.98 kcal /mol.

Thus, after conversion, Candidate 2 gives ≈ 26.98 kcal /mol, whereas Candidate 1 gives 27.000 kcal /mol.  
Comparing to six significant digits: 26.9800 vs 27.0000 differ at the third decimal place, so Rule 4 says they are not identical.

Moreover, Candidate 2 does not state “per molecule” or “per mole”, leaving the unit basis ambiguous (Rule 1).

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same dimensionless number:

• Candidate 1: “3 10^{26}” is standard shorthand for 3 × 10²⁶.  
• Candidate 2: “3.0 × 10²⁶” explicitly states 3 × 10²⁶ (with one extra significant figure, which does not alter the value to six significant digits: 3.00000 × 10²⁶).

Since they represent the identical numerical value and no units are involved, the two answers are equivalent.

0.030000 and 0.0295545 differ at the third significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different kinds of answers:

• Candidate 1 supplies a numerical probability: 0.3359 (which, padded to six significant digits, is 0.335900).

• Candidate 2 supplies a symbolic sum  
  ∑_{k=27}^{50} C(50,k)(½)^{50}.

That sum equals P{Bin(50,½) ≥ 27}.  Computing this exactly gives

 P = 0.335905…  (≈ 0.335906 to six significant digits).

Comparing the six-significant-digit forms:

 Candidate 1: 0.335900  
 Candidate 2: 0.335906

They differ in the 6th significant digit, so by Rule 4 the answers are not the same. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
0.3359 (Candidate 1) is a numerical probability, whereas Candidate 2 gives the exact binomial sum  
\[
\sum_{k=27}^{50}\binom{50}{k}\left(\frac12\right)^{50}.
\]

Evaluating that sum exactly equals  

\[
P=\frac{1-\bigl[\binom{50}{24}+\binom{50}{25}+\binom{50}{26}\bigr]2^{-50}}{2}
\approx 0.335905.
\]

Expressed to six significant digits this is 0.335905.  
Candidate 1’s value, with the implied six-digit representation 0.335900, differs in the 6th significant digit (0 vs 5).

According to Rule 4, answers that do not match to six significant digits are not equivalent.

The question either expects four separate probabilities (for Y = 0, 1, 2, 3) or the single cumulative probability P(Y ≤ 3).  
Regardless of that interpretation:

• Both candidates give only one numerical value, so if four separate answers are required, both are incomplete; however, we still compare the values they actually give.  
• Treating the responses as single numerical predictions, compare them using Rule 4 (six-significant-digit equality):

 Candidate 1: 0.998400  
 Candidate 2: 0.998200  

These differ (0.998400 ≠ 0.998200).

Express each to six significant digits:

Evaluate Candidate 2: 
1 – 1/e ≈ 1 – 0.367 879 441 171… = 0.632 120 558 829…

Candidate 1 gives 0.6321205588, which matches 1 – 1/e to at least the first 6 significant digits (0.632120).

Thus, by Rule 4, the two candidates are equivalent.

Based on Rule 4, we must compare the numerical answers to six significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 4152 K → 4.15200 × 10³ (digits: 4 1 5 2 0 0)  
• Candidate 2: 4151 K → 4.15100 × 10³ (digits: 4 1 5 1 0 0)

The fourth significant digit differs (2 vs 1), so the two answers are not identical to six significant digits.

The question expects a single numerical value for ΔS°, which should carry the unit J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.

Candidate 1: –191.2 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹  
Candidate 2: –198.7 J/K (mol⁻¹ not stated)

1. Units: Candidate 2 omits “per mol,” creating ambiguity (Rule 1).  
2. Numerical value: Even if we assumed the missing “mol⁻¹,” the two values differ (–191.200 vs –198.700; they do not match to 6 significant digits, Rule 4).

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives “5.85 10⁴” with no unit, whereas Candidate 2 specifies “5.85 × 10⁴ K.”  
Because temperature could reasonably be expressed in different units (Kelvin, Celsius, etc.), the omission of a unit in Candidate 1 introduces ambiguity. According to Rule 1, this makes the answers inequivalent.

The units are the same (J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹), so compare the numerical values.

Candidate 1: 146 → 146.000 (to six significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 146.3 → 146.300 (to six significant digits)

146.000 and 146.300 differ in the third decimal place, so they are not the same to six significant digits.

Candidate 2: 15 394 yr (already in years).

Express both in the same units with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 15 400.0 yr (or 4.86000 × 10¹¹ s)  
• Candidate 2 → 15 394.0 yr (or 4.85798 × 10¹¹ s)

The numbers differ beginning at the third significant digit (154000 vs 153940) and therefore do not match to six significant digits.

The two candidates give the age in different units, so first convert Candidate 1’s result to years.

1 year ≈ 3.15576 × 10^7 s  
Candidate 1: 4.86 × 10^11 s  
Age = (4.86 × 10^11 s)/(3.15576 × 10^7 s yr⁻¹) ≈ 1.54004 × 10^4 yr ≈ 15 400 yr

Candidate 2 states the age directly as 15 400 years.

Now compare the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 (in years): 1.54004 × 10^4  
• Candidate 2:            1.54000 × 10^4  

They differ at the 5th significant digit, so they do **not** match to 6 significant digits. Hence, according to the strict comparison rule, the answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 9.6 × 10⁻⁶ m²/s = 0.96 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s

Expressed with the same exponent (10⁻⁵), the numbers are 1.10000 and 0.960000.  
They differ already in the first two significant digits and therefore are not equal to 6 significant figures.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The result that needs to be reported is an entropy change, whose correct unit is J K⁻¹.

• Candidate 1: “24.4  J K⁻¹” – supplies the correct numerical value with the appropriate entropy unit.

• Candidate 2: “24.4  J” – supplies the same numerical value but omits “per kelvin,” giving a unit of energy rather than entropy and introducing ambiguity.

Because the units differ and candidate 2’s answer lacks the required “per kelvin,” the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 1).

Both candidates give the same numerical value and the same unit.

• Candidate 1: “1.51 10⁴ bar” (understood as 1.51 × 10⁴ bar)  
• Candidate 2: “1.51 × 10⁴ bar”

Same unit (bar) and same magnitude (1.51 × 10⁴). Thus the predictions are equivalent.

The task asks for four separate residues modulo 24, each potentially depending on the integers n and α.

• Candidate 1 claims all four expressions are congruent to 0 (mod 24).  
• Candidate 2 gives distinct formulas for the four residues:  
  1) 9 n + 18 α + 4,  
  2) 9 n + 18 α + 7,  
  3) 9 n + 18 α + 13,  
  4) 9 n + 18 α + 16  (all taken mod 24).

These two sets of answers are clearly different: Candidate 2’s residues are generally not equal to 0 (mod 24) for arbitrary n and α, whereas Candidate 1 asserts they always are. Therefore, by Rule 2 (multiple sub-answers must match exactly) and basic arithmetic, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are different.

Candidate 1  
F₁(z,q)=(-zq;q²)₍∞₎ /(zq;q)₍∞₎

Candidate 2  
F₂(z,q)=∏_{n=1}^{∞} 1/(1−zqⁿ)=1/(zq;q)₍∞₎

Since
1/(zq;q)₍∞₎ = F₂(z,q),

we can write candidate 1 as  
F₁(z,q)=(-zq;q²)₍∞₎ · F₂(z,q).

The extra factor  
(-zq;q²)₍∞₎ = ∏_{k=0}^{∞}(1+zq^{1+2k})  
is not identically equal to 1, so F₁ and F₂ are different formal power series.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are different:

• Candidate 1 F_c(z,q) = (-z q; q²)_∞ / (z q; q)_∞  
  = ∏_{k=0}^{∞}(1 + z q^{2k+1}) / ∏_{n=1}^{∞}(1 − z q^{n})

• Candidate 2 F_c(z,q) = ∏_{n=1}^{∞} 1/(1 − z q^{n})  
  = 1 / (z q; q)_∞

Candidate 1 contains the extra factor (−z q; q²)_∞ = ∏_{k=0}^{∞}(1 + z q^{2k+1}), which is not identically 1, so the two expressions are not equal in general.

Candidate 1 gives
• (if e₀ = 0) aw = 2 + Σ_{i≤ℓ} eᵢ + 2 Σ_{i>ℓ} eᵢ  
• (if e₀ ≥ 1) aw = 3 + Σ_{i≤ℓ} eᵢ + 2 Σ_{i>ℓ} eᵢ  

Candidate 2 gives  
 aw = 3 e₀ + 3 Σ_{i≤ℓ} eᵢ + 4 Σ_{i>ℓ} eᵢ.

These formulas are plainly different: in Candidate 1 the coefficients of eᵢ are 1 or 2, while in Candidate 2 they are 3 or 4; Candidate 1 also contains only a constant term 2 or 3, whereas Candidate 2 contains coefficients multiplied by e₀, eᵢ instead of an overall constant. For example, with e₀ = 0, ℓ = 1, s = 1, and e₁ = 2, Candidate 1 gives aw = 4 whereas Candidate 2 gives aw = 6. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are

Candidate 1: 1 / (2^{\(\binom{m}{2}\)} m!)

Candidate 2: (1 / m!) · (1/4)^{\(\binom{m}{2}\)}.

Because  
(1/4)^{\(\binom{m}{2}\)} = (2^{-2})^{\(\binom{m}{2}\)} = 2^{-2\binom{m}{2}},  
while  
1/2^{\(\binom{m}{2}\)} = 2^{-\binom{m}{2}},  

the two candidates differ by a factor of 2^{- \(\binom{m}{2}\)} (except when \(\binom{m}{2}=0\), i.e. m = 0 or 1). For general m ≥ 1 they are not equal.

The two expressions are different elements of GW(𝔽_q).

Candidate 1 expands to
 [ binom(n,j) – binom((n–2)/2 , (j–1)/2) ] · 1 + binom((n–2)/2 , (j–1)/2) · u,

whereas Candidate 2 is
 0 · 1 + binom(n,j) · u.

Since, in general, binom(n,j) ≠ binom((n–2)/2 , (j–1)/2) and the coefficient of 1 is different (non-zero vs. zero), the two elements are not the same in GW(𝔽_q). Thus the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for three separate pieces of information:
1. \([T(R),T(R)]\)
2. \(\dim_{Z(R)} R\)
3. The type of the involution \(*\)

Comparison of the two candidates:

1. \([T(R),T(R)]\): both candidates give \(0\) – they agree.
2. \(\dim_{Z(R)} R\): candidate 1 says \(4\); candidate 2 says \(1\) – they disagree.
3. Type of involution: both state “first kind,” so they agree here.

Because at least one of the required sub-answers differs (the second one), the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both answers describe the ring of integers in a quadratic field.  
For square-free d, the only possible congruence classes mod 4 are 1, 2, 3 (0 is impossible because d square-free cannot be divisible by 4).

• Candidate 1:  
 O_K = Z[√d] if d ≢ 1 (mod 4) → this covers d ≡ 2 or 3.  
 O_K = Z[(1+√d)/2] if d ≡ 1 (mod 4).

• Candidate 2:  
 O_K = Z[√d] if d ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4).  
 O_K = Z[(1+√d)/2] if d ≡ 1 (mod 4).

The two descriptions match exactly for every square-free d. Hence the candidates are equivalent.

The question has four sub-cases (a)–(d), so each candidate must supply four corresponding values.

• Candidate 1 supplies:  
(a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 4.

• Candidate 2 supplies:  
(a) 2, (b) 2, (c) 2, (d) 2.

Comparing sub-case by sub-case, the answers differ in cases (a), (c), and (d). Because at least one sub-answer is different, the two candidate predictions are not identical (Rule 2).

For k = 2, Candidate 1 gives 0.5 while Candidate 2 gives 1; for k = 3, Candidate 1 gives 6/27 ≈ 0.222 while Candidate 2 gives 1. Therefore the two answers are not numerically or algebraically the same. They are inequivalent.

• Candidate 1 includes, for every k ≥ 2, the solutions (1,0,k,1) (with m = 0) and also includes pairs with m = 3 such as (0,3,2,1) and (0,3,2,2).

• Candidate 2 never lists any solution with m = 0 or m = 3; instead it gives families with m = 1 or m = 2, e.g. (1,1,k,x), (0,1,k,x), (3,2,2,2), etc.

Because the two answer sets contain different solutions and omit ones that the other includes, they are not the same. Hence the predictions are inequivalent.

The two expressions are not algebraically identical:

Candidate 1: C₁ =  binom{n-1}{k-1} − binom{n-k-1}{k-1} − binom{n-k-2}{k-2} + 2  
Candidate 2: C₂ =  binom{n-1}{k-1} − 1

Their difference is  
C₁ − C₂ = − binom{n-k-1}{k-1} − binom{n-k-2}{k-2} + 3.

For the two candidates to be equivalent, the right‐hand side would have to be zero for all admissible n and k, i.e.  
binom{n-k-1}{k-1} + binom{n-k-2}{k-2} ≡ 3,  
which is false in general (e.g. for k = 3, n = 7 it already fails).

Hence the two candidate bounds are not the same.

The two expressions differ by the term  

- C(n − k − 2, k − 2) + 1.

Since k ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2k + 1, the binomial coefficient C(n − k − 2, k − 2) is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, so the two bounds cannot be the same in general. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for the complete Steklov-Lamé spectrum (all eigenvalues with their multiplicities).  

Candidate 1 lists five distinct groups of eigenvalues, including the triple zero eigenvalue and two different infinite families, each with stated multiplicities.

Candidate 2 lists only  
• one single eigenvalue \(2(\lambda+\mu)/R\), and  
• one infinite family \(\bigl[n(n+1)\mu+2(\lambda+\mu)\bigr]/R\) (multiplicity 2).  

Candidate 2 omits the zero eigenvalue and the families \(2\mu(n-1)/R\) and \(2(n+1)\mu(\lambda+\mu)/[(\lambda+3\mu)R]\) that appear in Candidate 1, and its second family does not match either of the families in Candidate 1. Hence the two spectra are different.

Candidate 1 gives a detailed piecewise formula involving multinomial coefficients; the values clearly vary with s and d.

Candidate 2 lists two contradictory tiny piecewise possibilities (“answer 1” and “answer 2”) that only give 0 or 1 and does not commit to one of them.  Even ignoring the contradiction, either of those constant answers is completely different from Candidate 1’s non-constant formula.

Thus the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two proposed formulas are clearly different:

• Candidate 1 keeps only those subspace dimensions congruent to ⎣n/2⎦ modulo (t+1), giving roughly (n+1)/(t+1) terms spread across the whole range 0,…,n.

• Candidate 2 sums the last t terms (dimensions n–t+1,…,n).

Since these index sets are generally not the same (e.g. for n = 10, t = 1, candidate 1 sums over all odd ℓ while candidate 2 sums only k = 10), the resulting cardinalities are not equal.

• Candidate 2 coefficient: \((\lambda\beta)^{m} = \beta^{m}\lambda^{m}\)

Unless \(\frac{m!}{\Gamma(m\beta+1)} = \beta^{m}\) for every \(m\) and every \(\beta\) (which is not true in general), the two series are not the same. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Because the factors multiplying S(n,m) differ (candidate 1 has m!/Γ(mβ+1); candidate 2 has β^m), the expressions are not the same.

• Candidate 2:

The two candidates are **not** equivalent.

Reasoning:

• Candidate 1 requires Ω to be (up to measure-zero) a ball centred at an arbitrary point (x₀, ω₀) and f to be any translated-and-modulated Gaussian (c e^{2πi x·ω₀} φ(x−x₀)).  
• Candidate 2 merely says Ω is “a ball” and f “a Gaussian”. It does not state that the ball may be centred anywhere nor that f may be translated/modulated by arbitrary shifts and frequencies.

Thus Candidate 2 gives a strictly more restrictive/ambiguous set of conditions than Candidate 1, so the two answers do not match.
Both candidates agree that  
• Ω must be (essentially) a ball of finite measure.

For the function f, however:  
• Candidate 1 demands f be a translate-and-modulate of a fixed Gaussian,
  f(x)=c e^{2πi x·ω₀} φ(x−x₀).  
• Candidate 2 only says “f is a Gaussian function,” without specifying whether all
translations/modulations (or only the centred, un-modulated Gaussian) are allowed.

Thus Candidate 2 is less specific and could permit or exclude cases that Candidate 1
explicitly requires.  Because the two descriptions of f are not guaranteed to match,
the answers are not fully equivalent.

• Candidate 2 gives  
 (2^{8} − 2^{6} + 2·2^{5}) / 2 = 256 / 2 = 128.  

Since 112 ≠ 128, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for TWO specific pieces of information:  
1) the orientation that f must have, and  
2) the value of its similarity ratio.

• Both candidates give a similarity ratio of 1, so they match on that part.  
• Their statements about orientation, however, are different:

  – Candidate 1: “non-oblique” (i.e. axis-aligned, no rotation).  
  – Candidate 2: “orientation must be preserved” (i.e. determinant > 0, forbids reflections but still allows rotations).

These describe different conditions, so the two answers are not identical for the orientation requirement.

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 contains no parameter \(m\); it is purely in terms of \(n\) and \(\gamma\) (with ordinary Pochhammer symbols and Gamma functions).

Both candidates supply two numerical expressions for the surface-crossing number, namely  

• 6g  
• 6g − 3  

Candidate 1 explicitly ties “6g” to the n ≡ 0 (mod 12) case and “6g − 3” to the n ≡ 6 (mod 12) case.  
Candidate 2 lists the same two expressions as “answer 1” and “answer 2.” Given that the question presents the two residue classes in the order n ≡ 0, then n ≡ 6, the natural reading is that “answer 1” corresponds to the first case and “answer 2” to the second. Thus the mathematical content of the two answers matches exactly.

No units are involved and the required number of sub-answers is satisfied in both cases.

Candidate 1 states that  
γ_P(K_m □ K_{1,n}) = min{ m − 1, n − 1 }.

Candidate 2 states that  
γ_P(K_m □ K_{1,n}) = 1.

For m,n ≥ 3 we have m − 1 ≥ 2 and n − 1 ≥ 2, so Candidate 1’s value is at least 2, whereas Candidate 2’s value is 1. The two answers are therefore different.

The two candidates are NOT equivalent.

Key differences:
1. Dependence on r_\infty:  
 • Candidate 1’s exponent contains “(λ_E – r_∞) n”;  
 • Candidate 2’s exponent contains simply “λ n” with no r_∞ term.  
 Unless one explicitly identifies λ with (λ_E – r_∞), the formulas differ by a term that grows linearly with n.

2. Sign/location of ν:  
 • Candidate 1 puts “+ ν” in the exponent.  
 • Candidate 2 puts “– ν” in the exponent but multiplies by an unspecified constant C.  
 Although an overall constant could absorb a fixed power of p, this does not repair the missing r_∞ dependence.

3. Form of the statement: equality for large n (Candidate 1) versus only an asymptotic relation “∼ C ⋅ …” (Candidate 2).

Because of the missing r_∞ term (and the other discrepancies), the two answers are not the same.

The question asks for **all** integer solutions.  
Candidate 1 lists four solutions:  
• (1, 1, 1)  
• (1, 1, –1)  
• (1, –1, 0)  
• (–1, 1, 0)

Candidate 2 lists only three solutions:  
• (1, 1, 1)  
• (1, –1, 0)  
• (–1, 1, 0)

Candidate 2 omits the valid solution (1, 1, –1) that Candidate 1 includes.  
Because the two answer sets are not identical, the predictions are **not equivalent** (Rule 2).

Candidate 1: n! e^{x+y} / (e^{x}+e^{y}-e^{x+y})^{\,n+1}

Candidate 2: y e^{n x} / (e^{y}-1)

They have distinct functional dependence on x, y, and n (note the presence of n! and the factor y in different places, and the very different denominators). Hence they cannot be algebraically identical.

The candidates give two different explicit formulas for λ:

• Candidate 1: λ = 1 − (2 δ)/[(n − 1) diam²]

• Candidate 2: λ = 1 − δ/(n · diam)

These expressions are not algebraically the same (different powers of diam, different numerical factors, different use of n vs. n − 1). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical expressions:

• Candidate 1:  χ_q = n + 1  
• Candidate 2:  χ_q = 3

These coincide only if n + 1 = 3, i.e. n = 2, but the problem restricts n to values of the form n = 4t − 1 (t ≥ 1), giving n = 3, 7, 11, …; for these n, n + 1 ≠ 3. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give exactly the same rational function.

•  Candidate 1 (already rewritten)  
   (1 – q + q³)/(1 – 2q + 2q³ – q⁴)

•  Candidate 2  
   (q³ – q + 1)/[(1 – q)³(1 + q)]

Expanding the denominator of Candidate 2:  
(1 – q)³(1 + q) = (1 – 3q + 3q² – q³)(1 + q)  
                  = 1 – 2q + 2q³ – q⁴

This matches Candidate 1’s denominator exactly, and the numerators are the same up to ordering of terms.  
Therefore the two expressions are algebraically identical.

The two expressions are structurally different:

• Candidate 1:  inf_{D ∈ 𝒟_n(X)} max { diam D, λ − α(D), diam X − λ }

  – contains λ explicitly;
  – takes an infimum over D;
  – the maximand involves three terms.

• Candidate 2:  max { diam X, diam D + α(D) }

  – λ is absent;
  – there is no infimum over D;
  – the maximand involves only two terms and depends on D in a different way.

Since the expressions involve different variables, different operations (infimum in one, none in the other), and their sets of maximized terms are not the same, they cannot be algebraically or functionally equivalent.

The two answers give different explicit formulas.

• Candidate 1:  (Γ(γ+1) / Γ_m(γ+1)) (1−m)^{−γ}.  
  (Here Γ_m is the q-gamma function with base m.)

• Candidate 2:  Γ(γ+1) / m^{γ+1}.

Setting γ = 0 illustrates the discrepancy:

 Candidate 1 → 1 / Γ_m(1) = 1 (since Γ_m(1)=1),  
 Candidate 2 → 1 / m.

Unless m = 1 (which is excluded because (m;m)_k would vanish), the two results differ. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical/formula answer (the cardinality of the set).  

• Candidate 1 gives the formula  
  C₁ =  \(\displaystyle \binom{\frac{s-2}{2}+\frac{t-1}{2}}{\frac{s-2}{2}}\).

• Candidate 2 gives the formula  
  C₂ =  \(\tau(s)\tau(t)\) (product of the divisor‐count functions of \(s\) and \(t\)).

These two expressions are plainly different algebraic functions of \(s\) and \(t\).  
For instance, with \(s=2,\; t=3\) (which satisfy the given conditions),  
 C₁ = \(\binom{0+1}{0}=1\) whereas  
 C₂ = \(\tau(2)\tau(3)=2\cdot2=4\).  
Since they yield different results, the answers are not equivalent.

Hence, according to Rule 1/Rule 4, the candidates are inequivalent.
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

• Candidate 1:  C = 𝚿((s-2)/2 + (t-1)/2 , (s-2)/2)  (a binomial coefficient)  
• Candidate 2:  C = s + t – 1  (a linear expression)

They clearly are not the same formula, and simple test values (e.g. s = 2, t = 1 or s = 4, t = 3) already give different numerical results. Therefore the predictions are inequivalent.

The two candidates give completely different closed-form formulas.

• Candidate 1 expresses S_D and S_P as finite q-Pochhammer products up to ⌈N/2⌉ and involves the factor (–q^r).

• Candidate 2 expresses its two answers as infinite products ((ab; (ab)^2)_∞ etc.) and uses different parameters; it does not depend on N at all and has no (–q^r) factor.

Since the functional forms, the dependence on N, and several parameters differ, the two sets of answers cannot be the same.

    ≠ x(x^{10}+x^{8}+2x^{6}-4x^{4}+4x^{2}-1),

since, for example, the constant term on the left side is –1 while on the right side it is 0.

Evaluating both at \(c=5\) (which is allowed since \(c\ge 3\)):

 Candidate 1: \(s(5)=\dfrac{(3\cdot5+5)2^{2}+(-1)^5(5-15)}{9}
= \dfrac{20\cdot4+(-1)(-10)}{9}
= \dfrac{80+10}{9}=10.\)

The two candidates give different formulas:

• Candidate 1:  ∑_{ℓ=0, ℓ ≡ ⌊n/2⌋ (mod (t+1))}^n  C(n, ℓ)

• Candidate 2:  2^{\,n − t}

These are plainly not the same expression for general n and t (e.g., for t=1, n=4 the first gives C(4,2)=6, while the second gives 2^{3}=8). Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2:  2^{\,n-t}

These expressions are plainly not the same for general n and t (they scale differently and coincide, if ever, only in special accidental cases). Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
S = k − e^{−k t} ∑_{s=0}^{k−1} (k−s) [ L_s^{(−1)}(k t) ]^2  

Candidate 2 gives  
S = ∑_{s=0}^{∞} L_s^{(−1)}(k t) t^{s}  

These two formulas are structurally different: one is a finite sum with an exponential factor, squared Laguerre polynomials, and coefficient (k − s); the other is an infinite power series with no exponential, no squares, and no (k − s) factor.  There is no algebraic manipulation that turns one into the other given the symbols as stated.  

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give entirely different mathematical expressions for the limit \(S_N(k;t)\):

• Candidate 1: \(k - e^{-kt}\displaystyle\sum_{s=0}^{k-1} (k-s)\bigl(L_s^{(-1)}(kt)\bigr)^2\)

• Candidate 2: \(\displaystyle\sum_{s=0}^{\infty} L_s^{(-1)}(kt)\,t^{s}\)

These expressions have different functional forms, different summation ranges (finite vs. infinite), different extra factors (\(k\) and \(e^{-kt}\) vs. \(t^{s}\)), and thus cannot be algebraically identical for general \(k\) and \(t\). Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

 4 Γ(p) / Γ(p/2)

in front of the integral/‖∇ₕ f‖ₚᵖ.  
For p = 2 this factor is 4, and in general it is not equal to 1.

The question asks for the specific distributions that form the saddle-point.  
Candidate 1 specifies zero-mean Gaussian distributions whose covariance matrices are  
• \(P_X : \tfrac{P}{n}\,I_{n}\) and  
• \(P_Z : \tfrac{N}{n}\,I_{n}\).

Candidate 2 specifies zero-mean Gaussians with (scalar) variances  
• \(P_X : P\) and  
• \(P_Z : N\).

Unless \(n=1\), these choices differ: Candidate 1’s total power equals \(P\) (since each of \(n\) coordinates has variance \(P/n\)), whereas Candidate 2 would have total power \(nP\). The two candidates therefore give different distributions in general, and the answers cannot be regarded as the same.

• Candidate 2: \(N(m,\,n)=\dfrac{1}{m}\binom{m}{n}\binom{m}{\,n-1}\).

The parameters fed to the Narayana number (and therefore the numerical values) differ (\((m+n,n)\) vs \((m,n)\)), and the prefactors \(1/(m+n)\) vs \(1/m\) are not equal in general. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 multiplies \(1/|\operatorname{Aut}_{R_j}(G_j)|\) by an extra Euler-type factor  
\(\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}(1-p^{-i\deg(P_j)})\) for every \(j\).

Candidate 2 includes only the factor \(1/|\operatorname{Aut}_{R_j}(G_j)|\) and omits that infinite product.

Since \(\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}(1-p^{-i\deg(P_j)})\neq 1\) for any positive degree, the two expressions are not equal. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas for both the interpolating function and its norm.

• Candidate 1 supplies a formula that depends on p, with the factor  
  (1 – ‖z₀‖²) raised to 2(n+1)/p in f₍min₎ and (n+1)/p in the norm.

• Candidate 2 writes the interpolant as w₀ K(z,z₀)/‖K(·,z₀)‖ and the norm as |w₀|/‖K(·,z₀)‖.  Interpreting K as the usual Bergman kernel gives powers of (1 – ‖z₀‖²) only with exponent (n+1)/2, independent of p.

Hence, unless p happens to equal 2, the answers disagree, and even for p = 2 the power of (1 – ‖z₀‖²) in f₍min₎ differs ((n+1) versus (n+1)/2).  Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give essentially the same “answer”:  
• Candidate 1 says that χ is the unique function that satisfies the displayed functional equations (on ℕ₀ʳ and by rising-continuation on ℤₚʳ).  
• Candidate 2 likewise says that χ is the unique rising-continuous function determined recursively by the same equations, adding only the observation that one may write it as an infinite series over the base-p digits.

Candidate 2 does not impose any additional, incompatible condition nor provide a different formula; it only elaborates on exactly the same characterization that Candidate 1 uses. Therefore both candidates identify the same object and are equivalent answers.

The two candidates give different expressions when \(\ell_j > 1+\sqrt{\gamma}\).

• Candidate 1: \(\hat{\ell}_j \to \ell_j\!\left(1+\dfrac{\gamma}{\ell_j-1}\right)\), which is strictly larger than both \(\ell_j\) and \((1+\sqrt{\gamma})^{2}\) for \(\gamma>0\).

• Candidate 2: \(\hat{\ell}_j \to \max\bigl(\ell_j,\,(1+\sqrt{\gamma})^{2}\bigr)\).

Thus, for \(\ell_j > (1+\sqrt{\gamma})^{2}\), Candidate 2 yields \(\ell_j\) whereas Candidate 1 yields the larger value above; and for \(1+\sqrt{\gamma} < \ell_j < (1+\sqrt{\gamma})^{2}\), Candidate 2 still gives \((1+\sqrt{\gamma})^{2}\) while Candidate 1 gives a value slightly bigger than that. Hence the predictions are not the same.

Since (q²;q²)_∞ / (q;q)_∞ = ∏_{n=1}^{∞}(1+q^{n}) ≠ 1/(q;q)_∞, the two expressions are not the same.

For Φ:
• Candidate 1: Φ = 1/(q;q)_∞²  
• Candidate 2: Φ = 1/(q;q²)_∞ = 1/∏_{n odd}(1−q^{n})

These are also clearly different.

• Candidate 2 simply sums two ranks for each pair:

Both candidates answer both sub-problems, but they disagree on sub-problem (i):

• Candidate 1: N_\mu(𝔷) = 1 for every 𝔷.  
• Candidate 2: N_\mu(𝔷) = 0 for every 𝔷.

Since at least one requested answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different explicit expressions for both S₁ and S₂:

• For S₁:  
 Candidate 1 → (u;q²)∞  
 Candidate 2 → (u;q²)∞ / (u;q)∞  

These two expressions are only equal if (u;q)∞ = 1, which is not true in general.

• For S₂:  
 Candidate 1 → (u;q)∞  
 Candidate 2 → (u;q²)∞ / (u;q)∞  

Again, the two expressions are not the same for generic u and q.

Since at least one of the sub-answers differs, the sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question asks for a single 5-tuple \((|x|, |y|, \alpha, p, |s^\beta z^3|)\).  
Candidate 1 proposes (2, 1, 1, 7, 125).  
Candidate 2 proposes (3, 1, 0, 5, 16).

These tuples differ in four of the five components (first, third, fourth, and fifth entries). Therefore the answers are not the same.

Candidate 2: F = 1/3 ≈ 0.333333

These differ well beyond 6 significant digits, so they are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not obviously giving the same quantity:

• Candidate 1 states the answer is “\(M_n\)” but does not tell us what \(M_n\) equals.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly gives \(\displaystyle \frac{1}{\,n+1}\binom{2n}{n}\).

Unless one already knows (from outside this exchange) that \(M_n\) is defined to be \(\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}\), there is no way to verify an equivalence. Within the information provided here, \(M_n\) is an undefined symbol, so the two answers are not guaranteed to match.

The question asks for a single numerical/sequential quantity (a function of n).  

• Candidate 1 says the value is “\(M_n\)” (without defining \(M_n\)).  
• Candidate 2 says the value is the Catalan number \(\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}\).

Unless the symbol \(M_n\) is explicitly defined in the problem statement to be the Catalan number, the two assertions are different: \(M_n\) could represent Motzkin numbers (a common usage) or something else entirely. Because the equivalence of \(M_n\) and the Catalan number is not established in either the question or the candidates’ answers, the two predictions cannot be regarded as the same.

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give explicit closed-form formulas.  
Candidate 1: C(2 n − 2 − k, k)  
Candidate 2: (1/n) · C(n, k) · C(n, k+1)

To see whether they coincide, evaluate both for the same (n, k):

Example (n, k) = (4, 1):
 Candidate 1 = C(2·4 – 2 – 1, 1) = C(5, 1) = 5  
 Candidate 2 = (1/4)·C(4, 1)·C(4, 2) = (1/4)·4·6 = 6  

Since 5 ≠ 6, the two expressions are not identical functions; hence the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different closed-form expressions:

Candidate 1:  C₁ = 𝑪(2n − 2 − k, k)

Candidate 2:  C₂ = N(n,k+1) = (1/n) 𝑪(n,k+1) 𝑪(n,k)

Checking concrete values shows they disagree; e.g. for n = 4, k = 1

 C₁ = 𝑪(5,1)=5, C₂ = (1/4)·𝑪(4,2)·𝑪(4,1)=6.

Since the two formulas are not equal, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas.

Candidate 1:  
• \(m_k = q^k\,m_0\)

Candidate 2:  
• \(m_k = (q+1)^k\,m_0\)  
• \(n_k = (q+1)^k\,m_0 + (n_0-m_0) q^k\)

Since \(q^k \neq (q+1)^k\) in general, the expressions for \(m_k\) already differ, making the answers inequivalent. The \(n_k\) expressions also clearly differ.

The two candidates give different algebraic formulas:

• Candidate 1: ⌈[(n−3)(n−4) − 2t]/12⌉  
• Candidate 2: ⌈[(n−2)(t−2)]/4⌉

These simplify to, respectively,

  ⌈(n² − 7n + 12 − 2t)/12⌉ and ⌈((n−2)t − 2n + 4)/4⌉,

which are not the same expression.  
A quick check with n = 6, t = 0 (allowed by the problem) gives:

  Candidate 1 → ⌈(3 − 0)/6⌉ = ⌈0.5⌉ = 1  
  Candidate 2 → ⌈−2⌉ = −2

Since the two results differ, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two formulas give different numerical values in general (e.g.\ for \(n=6,\;t=0\) they yield \(\lceil 0.5\rceil =1\) versus \(\lceil-2\rceil=-2\)), so they are not algebraically or numerically the same.

Both candidates state that the Conley–Zehnder index equals one-half of the signature of the matrix \(S\):

• Candidate 1: \(\conleyzehnder(A)=\tfrac12\signature(S)\)  
• Candidate 2: \(\tfrac12\,\sigma(S)\)  (with \(\sigma\) standing for the signature)

These expressions are identical.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 says  
 conleyzehnder(A) = ½ · signature(S).

Candidate 2 says  
 conleyzehnder(A) = signature(S).

These two expressions differ by a factor of 2 and are therefore not the same answer. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a detailed decomposition of the bipartite divisor graph  
(components such as “ K₂ ⨿ K_{1,3} ⨿ … ”), while Candidate 2 merely states how many conjugacy classes of subgroups there are in each case (“10” for p = 2; “p²+3” for p ≥ 3).  

These are not the same quantities and do not supply the same information required by the question. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 specifies the solution space as

Candidate 2 gives only C^{2, α}(Ω̄) without the integral condition.  
Because Candidate 1 adds an additional requirement that is absent in Candidate 2, the two answers describe different (nested) sets, not the same one.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different algebraic expressions:

Candidate 2:  
  # c𝒮 = C(m+n, m) · C(r+s, k)

The two formulas involve different functional dependencies on the parameters m, n, r, s, k (for example, Candidate 1 depends on m–r, n–s, etc., whereas Candidate 2 depends only on m+n and r+s). Since they are not algebraically identical and cannot coincide for all admissible parameter values, the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 expresses each z as a ratio of products of four lambda lengths (with one of them having a minus sign), and also asserts the equalities z_{01}=z_{23}, z_{02}=z_{13}, z_{03}=z_{12}.  
• Candidate 2 says each shape parameter is simply e^{-\lambda_{ij}}, with no ratios and no cross-edge equalities.

These expressions cannot be algebraically or numerically transformed into one another without introducing additional, unstated relationships (there is no way that a single exponential of one lambda length equals the given rational function of four others in general). Hence, the two candidates are not equivalent.

  – Candidate 2: { 2r − 2 − λ₂, …, 2r − 2 − λₙ, 2r − 2 − r }.

These sets are not the same (λ_i + r − 2 ≠ 2r − 2 − λ_i in general, and the extra eigenvalue −2 with multiplicity m−n is missing/mis-stated in Candidate 2).

• Candidate 2: C(4, 2) · (4 − 1)!! / [ (2 − 1)!! (2 − 1)!! ]

The question asks for the unique absolute value on K expressed via the norm.  

Candidate 1:   | 𝔂 |ₖ = | N_K(𝔂) |ₚ^{1/d}  
Candidate 2:   | x |ₖ = | N_{K/ℚ_p}(x) |ₚ^{1/d}

Both candidates give the same functional rule:
• same exponent 1/d  
• same p-adic absolute value |·|ₚ  
• same norm (N_K is standard shorthand for N_{K/ℚ_p})  
• only a change of dummy variable (𝔂 vs x).

Thus they define identical absolute values on K.

The two expressions are clearly different:

Candidate 1: \((q^{1/2};q)_\infty^2 /(q;q)_\infty\)

Candidate 2: \((1-q^{1/2})(q;q)_\infty^2\)

The infinite-product factors appearing in Candidate 1 involve only half-integer powers of \(q\) (squared) divided by a single copy of \((q;q)_\infty\), whereas Candidate 2 involves a single \((1-q^{1/2})\) factor times \((q;q)_\infty\) squared.  The locations and multiplicities of the factors \((1-q^{n+1/2})\) and \((1-q^{n+1})\) do not match, so the two products cannot be algebraically identical.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two proposed closed-form expressions are  

Candidate 1: ( q^{1/2}; q )_∞² / (q; q)_∞  

Candidate 2: (1 − q^{1/2})(q; q)_∞².

Using the definition (a;q)_∞ = ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−a q^{n}) we have  

(q^{1/2}; q)_∞² = ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−q^{n+1/2})²,  
(q; q)_∞   = ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−q^{n+1}).

Thus  

Candidate 1 = ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−q^{n+1/2})² / ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−q^{n+1}).  

Candidate 2 = (1−q^{1/2}) [∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−q^{n+1})]².

For the two candidates to be equal we would need  

(q^{1/2}; q)_∞² = (1−q^{1/2})(q; q)_∞³,

which is not a known identity and in fact is false.  
A quick series expansion corroborates this:

• Candidate 1 ≈ 1 − 2q^{1/2} + q + …  
• Candidate 2 ≈ 1 − q^{1/2} − 2q + …

The coefficients already differ at order q^{1/2}. Therefore the two expressions are not equivalent.
