The two proposed expressions for \(V_1(0,dy)\) are structurally different.

• Candidate 1:   
\(V_1(0,dy)=
2^{-\alpha}\pi^{-d/2}\dfrac{\Gamma(d/2)}{\Gamma(\alpha/2)^2}\,
|y|^{\alpha-d}\Bigl[\,
\int_{0}^{|y|^{-2}-1} (u+1)^{-d/2}\,u^{\alpha/2-1}\,du\Bigr]\;dy\).

This depends on \(|y|\) not only through a power factor \( |y|^{\alpha-d}\) but also inside the upper limit of the integral, so the overall dependence on \(|y|\) is not a simple power law.

• Candidate 2:   
\(V_1(0,dy)=
\dfrac{\alpha\;\Gamma\!\bigl(\frac{d+\alpha}{2}\bigr)}
     {2^{1-\alpha}\pi^{d/2}\,\Gamma\!\bigl(1-\frac{\alpha}{2}\bigr)}
 |y|^{-d-\alpha}\;dy\).

This is a pure power law in \(|y|\) with exponent \(-d-\alpha\) and contains no further \(|y|\)-dependence.

Because Candidate 1’s integrand yields a non-constant, \(|y|\)-dependent factor that cannot in general collapse to the simple power \( |y|^{-d-\alpha}\), the two expressions are not the same function of \(y\) (and their constant prefactors also differ). Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
 (½)·C·(1 + u) with C = binom{2j}{j}.  

Candidate 2 gives  
 C ⟨1⟩.

Interpreting “u” as the rank-2 hyperbolic plane H = ⟨1⟩ ⊕ ⟨−1⟩, we have

Candidate 1 = (C/2)(⟨1⟩ ⊕ ⟨−1⟩) = (C/2)H.

Candidate 2 = C ⟨1⟩.

Both have rank C, but their classes in the Witt part differ:
• (C/2)H is Witt-trivial (0 in W(Fq)).  
• C ⟨1⟩ is 0 in W(Fq) only when C is even or when ⟨1⟩ itself is trivial; otherwise it is the non-trivial element.

Hence the two expressions coincide only in special cases (e.g. C even and −1 a square), but are not equal in general. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Both candidates give the value 

  (½)·binom(2j, j)  ×  ( <1>  +  <-1> )

because in the usual notation for the Grothendieck-Witt ring over a field of characteristic ≠ 2, the symbol  

  1  represents the one–dimensional form <1>,  
  u  represents the one–dimensional form <-1>,

so 1 + u equals <1> + <-1>.  
Since the prefactor ½·binom(2j, j) is the same in both expressions, the two answers are the same element of GW(𝔽_q).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same answer for the case γ ∈ (0, 1], but for γ > 1 they differ:

• Candidate 2 uses the standard Marčenko–Pastur description: atom of mass 1 – 1/γ at 0 plus the usual density (with parameter γ) on [ (√γ – 1)² , (√γ + 1)² ].

• Candidate 1 instead puts weight 1/γ on a density with parameter 1/γ, whose support is [ (1 – 1/√γ)² , (1 + 1/√γ)² ]. That support (and the density) is not the same as Candidate 2’s and does not match the standard formula.

Thus the two answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates agree for the case γ ∈ (0,1], but they give different descriptions for γ > 1:

• Candidate 1 says the continuous part is (1/γ) f_{1/γ}(x) supported on [(1 − 1/√γ)², (1 + 1/√γ)²].

• Candidate 2 says the continuous part has density f_γ(x) supported on [(√γ − 1)², (√γ + 1)²].

These two supports are not the same for γ > 1 (e.g., for γ = 4 the first gives [0.25, 2.25] while the second gives [1, 9]). Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply expressions for S₁ and S₂, but the two sets of formulas are not the same.  
For example, rewriting Candidate 2’s S₁ with the identity  
(q;q)\_∞ = (q²;q²)\_∞ (q;q²)\_∞ gives  

Candidate 2: S₁ = 1/(q;q)\_∞  

Candidate 1: S₁ = (q²;q²)\_∞ (q⁴;q⁴)\_∞² / (q;q)\_∞²  

These differ by the factor (q⁴;q⁴)\_∞² / (q;q²)\_∞, which is generally not 1. Similar disagreement occurs for S₂. Therefore the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for two closed-product expressions, one for S₁ and one for S₂.  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both supply two expressions, but the expressions are plainly different:

• For S₁  
 Candidate 1: (q²;q²)∞ (q⁴;q⁴)∞² / (q;q)∞²  
 Candidate 2: 1 / (q;q)∞  

These two products are not the same (e.g. numerical check with q = 0.1 already shows a clear mismatch).

• For S₂  
 Candidate 1: (q²;q²)∞⁷ / [ (q;q)∞⁴ (q⁴;q⁴)∞² ]  
 Candidate 2: 2 / (q;q)∞  

Again, the two expressions are obviously different.

Since for each series the two candidates give non-equal answers, the overall sets of answers are inequivalent.

   • Candidate 2: w is even  

2. Statement about the coefficient a  
   • Candidate 1: a ≠ 0  
   • Candidate 2: a = 0  

Since the conditions on w and the conclusions about a do not match, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
N_neg(n, A) = (1/(2n)) ∑_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d}  +  floor( 2^{n-2} + 2^{ceil(n/2 – 2)} – (n+1)/2 ).

Candidate 2 gives  
N_neg(n, A) = (1/n) ∑_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d}.

Candidate 1 contains the extra “floor( … )” term and also multiplies the sum by 1/(2n) instead of 1/n.  
These two formulas coincide only if that floor term always equals the missing half of the sum, which is false in general (e.g. for n = 1 or n = 2 the two expressions give 1 vs 2, and 1.5 vs 3).

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different expressions:

• Candidate 1:
 N₍neg₎(n, A) = 1/(2n) ∑_{d|n} 2^{n/d} φ(d)  +  ⎣2^{n−2}+2^{⌈n/2−2⌉}−(n+1)/2⎦

• Candidate 2:
 N₍neg₎(n, A) = 1/n ∑_{d|n} φ(d) 2^{n/d}

They differ by
  – a factor 1/2 in front of the sum, and  
  – the extra floor-expression term appearing only in Candidate 1.

Plugging e.g. n = 1:

 Candidate 2 ⇒ 2  
 Candidate 1 ⇒ 1/(2)·2 + ⎣0.5+0.5−1⎦ = 1 + 0 = 1

Since the numerical results already disagree for n = 1, the two formulas are not equivalent.  

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives
N_neg(n, A) = [1 / (2n)] · Σ_{d∣n} (2^{n/d} φ(d))  +  ⌊ 2^{n−2} + 2^{⌈n/2−2⌉} − (n+1)/2 ⌋.

Candidate 2 gives
N_neg(n, A) = (1 / n) · Σ_{d∣n} φ(d) 2^{n/d}.

The two formulas differ in two ways:
1. The sum in Candidate 1 is multiplied by 1/(2n), whereas Candidate 2 has 1/n.
2. Candidate 1 includes an additional floor term involving powers of 2 and (n+1)/2 that is absent from Candidate 2.

Because of these discrepancies, the two candidates cannot be identical for general n.

The two candidates give different integrands.

The problem asks for three separate formulas (sub-answers) that depend on n, i, and k (and in part (3) also on the parity of k).

Candidate 1 supplies explicit formulas for all three requested cases.

Candidate 2 gives only a single short statement, “1 when k is odd, k when k is even,” which:
• does not address n or i at all,
• does not provide separate answers for the three listed cases, and
• conflicts numerically with candidate 1 in every instance.

Therefore, by Rule 2 (missing required sub-answers) and the clear numerical mismatch, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: single q-binomial multiplied only by q^{maj(σ)+maj(π)}  
   q^{maj(σ)+maj(π)} · [m+n−r−s choose k−r−s]_q

Candidate 1 gives
λ(θ_{n,0}(E)) = ((p – 1) · ordₚ(Δ_E) / 12) · p^{n–1} + λ(𝒳(E/ℚ_∞)).

Candidate 2 gives
λ(θ_{n,0}(E)) = p^{n–1}(p – 1) – ordₚ(Δ_E) + λ(𝒳(E/ℚ_∞)).

These two formulas are clearly different for general values of p, n, and ordₚ(Δ_E). For instance, if ordₚ(Δ_E)=0, Candidate 1 produces λ = λ(𝒳), whereas Candidate 2 produces λ = p^{n–1}(p–1)+λ(𝒳). Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives  
P₁(x) = (x⁶ + x⁵ + x³ − 2x² + 1)/[(x−1)² (x+1)(1 − 2x² − x⁴)].

Candidate 2 gives  
P₂(x) = x³/(1 − 2x).

The two rational functions have completely different numerators and, more importantly, completely different denominators—P₁’s denominator contains factors (x−1)², (x+1), and (1−2x²−x⁴), none of which is present in P₂. There is no algebraic way for these two expressions to be identical. Hence the answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different rational functions:

Candidate 1:  (x⁶ + x⁵ + x³ − 2x² + 1) / [ (x − 1)² (x + 1)(1 − 2x² − x⁴) ]

Candidate 2:  x³ / (1 − x)²

These expressions are not algebraically the same (the factors (x+1)(1−2x²−x⁴) appear only in Candidate 1, while Candidate 2 lacks them). Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Their numerators and denominators share no common factors that would make them algebraically identical, and their poles occur at distinct points (for example, Candidate 1 has a double pole at x = 1, whereas Candidate 2 does not). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are mathematically identical.

Explanation:
  
Candidate 1 gives  
 [zⁿ](φ(z))ᵏ = (k/n) · [z^{n−1}]( z^{k−1} R(z)ⁿ ).

Because [z^{n−1}]( z^{k−1} R(z)ⁿ ) = [z^{n−1−(k−1)}] R(z)ⁿ = [z^{n−k}] R(z)ⁿ,

Candidate 1 simplifies to  

 (zⁿ)(φ(z))ᵏ = (k/n) · [z^{n−k}] R(z)ⁿ,

which is exactly Candidate 2.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.
The two candidates give, after accounting for the factor z^{k-1} in Candidate 1,

[z^{n-1}](z^{k-1}R(z)^n)= [z^{n-k}]R(z)^n.

Thus Candidate 1’s formula becomes
(k/n)[z^{n-k}]R(z)^n,

which is exactly Candidate 2’s formula (with z renamed to w). Therefore the two answers are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give exactly the same bound:

Since multiplication is commutative, the two formulas are identical.

Candidate 1 gives formulas that grow like 4^{k} (exponential in k).  
Candidate 2 gives formulas 4 ∑_{d|n} χ(d), where the divisor sum of a Dirichlet character is at most on the order of the divisor function—i.e., it grows sub-polynomially, certainly not exponentially.  
Because the growth rates (and hence the actual values) cannot coincide for all k, the two answers cannot represent the same quantity.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 provides two explicit formulas—one for |A_{ℤ[i], 2k+1}| (k ≥ 0) and one for |A_{ℤ[i], 2k}| (k ≥ 1).

Candidate 2 supplies a single expression “4·(d₁(2k) − d₃(2k))” without distinguishing the two required cases. Thus Candidate 2 fails to give both requested answers, and the single formula it does give is structurally different from either of Candidate 1’s formulas.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give plainly different expressions for the same requested cardinalities.  
For instance, at k = 0 (so n = 2k+1 = 1):

• Candidate 1 yields  
|A_{ℤ[i],1}| = 14·4^{1} – 34·2^{1} + 8·0 + 29 = 56 – 68 + 29 = 17.

• Candidate 2 yields  
|A_{ℤ[i],1}| = 4 ∑_{d|1} χ(d) = 4·χ(1) = 4·1 = 4.

Since 17 ≠ 4, the two predictions are not equal, hence the candidates are not equivalent for this (and therefore for the whole problem).

The question effectively asks for a count for each of two different equations.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly supplies “0 for both equations,” i.e., two answers.  
• Candidate 1 gives only a single “0,” which does not explicitly cover both equations—so it supplies fewer answers than requested.

By Rule 2, this makes the two candidates not equivalent.
The question asks for a (possibly separate) count for each of the two equations.  
Candidate 2 explicitly states “0 for each equation,” giving an answer for both equations.  
Candidate 1 gives only a single “0,” which could at best cover one equation and leaves ambiguity for the other.

Because Candidate 1 does not supply an explicit answer for both required parts, the two responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for the (potentially different) number of non-trivial solution triples for each of two separate equations.  
Hence two answers—one for the first equation and one for the second—are required.

• Candidate 1 supplies only a single “0,” leaving it ambiguous (or incomplete) for the second equation.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly states “0 for each equation,” clearly giving two answers.

Because Candidate 1 does not provide an answer for each required part, the two responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates give different results for most values of n (and for τ in candidate 1).  
Candidate 1 states the answer is 2 (or 0 in some τ-cases), while candidate 2 gives 2ⁿ, which equals 2 only when n = 1 and differs otherwise.  
Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions for several of the six required parameters.  
For example, their formulas for v differ:

• Candidate 1: v = q^{2e-1}(q^{2e}-1)/(q-1)  
• Candidate 2: v = q^{4e}

These are not algebraically equal (check e = 2, q = 2 gives 120 vs 256).  
Since at least one parameter disagrees, the entire six-tuple of parameters is not the same.

The problem asks for six parameters (v, k, λ₁, λ₂, m, n).  
Both candidates list six numbers, so Rule 2 applies: every component must match.

Compare the first component v:

• Candidate 1  
 v₁ = q^{2e-1}(q^{2e}-1)/(q-1)

• Candidate 2  
 v₂ = q^{4e}

These expressions are not algebraically equal for general e ≥ 2 and prime-power q.  
(For example, with e = 2 one gets v₁ = q³ + q⁴ + q⁵ + q⁶ ≠ q⁸ = v₂.)

Since the very first required parameter already differs, the entire ordered 6-tuple is different.  
By Rule 2, any discrepancy in one of the sub-answers renders the two candidates inequivalent.

The two expressions are based on different q-Pochhammer products, whose terms do not match.

Candidate 1:
(-q^r ; ε q^{r+t+s})_∞ = ∏_{n≥0} (1 + ε^n q^{r + n(r+t+s)})

Candidate 2:
(-q^r ; q^{r+t})_∞ (-ε q^s ; q^s)_∞
    = ∏_{n≥0} (1 + q^{r + n(r+t)}) · ∏_{n≥0} (1 + ε q^{s + ns})

Since the factors and their exponents (and, when ε = –1, their signs) differ, the products are generally unequal. Thus the candidates are not equivalent.
The two expressions are different products.

Candidate 1 produces factors  
 1 + εⁿ q^{r + n(r+t+s)} for n = 0,1,2,…

Candidate 2 produces two separate factor families  
 1 + q^{r + n(r+t)} for n = 0,1,2,… and  
 1 + ε q^{s(m+1)} for m = 0,1,2,…

These sets of factors (and the ε–dependence) do not match except in special, non-generic parameter choices; in general the products are not the same. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give completely different $q$–products:

Candidate 1 $(-q^{r};\,\varepsilon q^{\,r+t+s})_{\infty}
             =\prod_{n\ge0}\!\bigl(1+\varepsilon^{\,n}q^{\,r+n(r+t+s)}\bigr).$

Candidate 2 $(q^{2s};q^{2s})_{\infty}\,
              (-q^{\,r+t};q^{2r})_{\infty}
             =\Bigl(\prod_{n\ge0}(1-q^{2s(n+1)})\Bigr)
              \Bigl(\prod_{n\ge0}(1+q^{r+t+2rn})\Bigr).$

The first product contains only the factors $1+\varepsilon^{n}q^{r+n(r+t+s)}$, whereas the second one always contains an additional independent factor $1-q^{2s(n+1)}$.  
For generic non-negative integers $r,t,s$ (with $r+t>0$) these two infinite products are clearly not identical (e.g. take $r=1,t=0,s=1,\varepsilon=1$). Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
 f₁(k) = 9·4ᵏ / (2 + 4ᵏ)²  

Candidate 2 gives  
 f₂(k) = (1/4ᵏ)·C(2k,k)

Check at k = 1 (an allowed integer):

• f₁(1) = 9·4 / (2+4)² = 36 / 36 = 1  
• f₂(1) = (1/4)·C(2,1) = (1/4)·2 = 0.5

Since 1 ≠ 0.5, the two expressions are not equal (and they will differ for general k).

The two candidates give different piecewise formulas.

• For even n:  
  – Candidate 1: (n²)/4 + 1

• For odd n ≥ 3:  
  – Candidate 1: 1  
  – Candidate 2: 2^{(n – 3)/2}

These also differ except at n = 3.

Since the formulas disagree on most values of n, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for two explicit closed-form expressions, γ₀,min and γ₀,max.  
Both candidates give formulas for those two quantities, so we must check if the pairs of formulas are identical.

Take one concrete parameter set, e.g. k = 3, s = 2, r = 4.

Candidate 1  
γ₀,min = (k+s)/[(s+1)k] + s²(k+r)/[(r−1)(s+1)k]  
          = 5/(3·3) + 4·7/(3·3·3)  
          = 5/9 + 28/27 ≈ 1.5926

Candidate 2  
γ₀,min = s / [ k + s(r−1) ]  
          = 2 / [3 + 2·3]  
          = 2/9 ≈ 0.2222

These values are clearly different, so the γ₀,min expressions are not the same.  
Because one of the two required sub-answers already differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Hence the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

1/2 · log [ σ₂² (σ₁² + c²) / (σ₁² (σ₂² + c²)) ]  

Candidate 1’s fraction
(1 + c²/σ₁²)/(1 + c²/σ₂²)  
simplifies to  
[(σ₁² + c²)/σ₁²] · [σ₂²/(σ₂² + c²)] = σ₂²(σ₁² + c²)/(σ₁²(σ₂² + c²)),  
which is exactly the argument of the logarithm in Candidate 2.

Therefore the two expressions are mathematically identical.

The two candidates give different explicit values: 

• Candidate 1: ½ log[(1 + c²/σ₁²)/(1 + c²/σ₂²)]

• Candidate 2:  (½) log [ σ₂² (R+σ₁²) / σ₁² (R+σ₂²) ]  (a logarithmic function of R)

Since a quadratic function of R cannot equal, for all allowed parameter values, a logarithm of a rational function of R, the two expressions are not the same. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 
C₁ = (R² / 2)·(1/σ₁² – 1/σ₂²).

Candidate 2 gives 
C₂ = (1/2)·log[ σ₂² (R + σ₁²) / ( σ₁² (R + σ₂²) ) ].

These two expressions have different functional forms: C₁ is a quadratic polynomial in R, whereas C₂ involves a logarithm of R.  
For example, for small positive R,
• C₁ ≈ (R² / 2)(1/σ₁² – 1/σ₂²)  (quadratic in R),  
• C₂ ≈ (R / 2)(1/σ₁² – 1/σ₂²)     (linear in R).  

Since they differ even in the first-order expansion (and hence for generic values of R), the two candidates are not mathematically equivalent.

m_k = 2^k m_0.

For n_k:

Candidate 1: n_k = 2^k n_0 (1 + k m_0 / (2 n_0)) = 2^k n_0 + 2^{k-1} k m_0.

Candidate 2: n_k = 2^{k-1}(2 n_0 + k m_0) = 2^k n_0 + 2^{k-1} k m_0.

These are the same expression. Thus the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give two different formulas:

• The coefficient in front of σ_element²(C,C) is n(n − 2)/(2(n − 3)) in Candidate 1, but simply n in Candidate 2.  
• The correction term in Candidate 1 is −1/[(n − 1)(n − 3)] ∑⟨R_k, Ĉ⟩², whereas in Candidate 2 it is −1/n (∑⟨R_k, Ĉ⟩)².

These expressions are not the same for general n and for arbitrary inner-product values. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates provide completely different formulas:

• Candidate 1 expresses σ_sum² as a linear combination of σ_element² and the sum of squared inner products, with coefficients depending on n.

• Candidate 2 expresses σ_sum² purely as the variance of the inner-product terms, with no appearance of σ_element² and with entirely different coefficients.

Since the algebraic forms differ and there is no straightforward identity that makes them equal for general n, the two answers cannot be the same.

The coefficients multiplying both σ_element^2(C,C) and the sum of inner products are different in the two formulas:

• Candidate 2: σ_sum^2 = n² σ_element^2  −  Σ⟨R_k, Ĉ⟩²

These coefficients are only equal for non-integer values of n (solutions of 2n² − 7n + 2 = 0), so for general integer n they are not the same expression. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The exponential factors differ (e^{-L ζ} vs e^{-ζ/ \tilde N₀}), the power-of-ζ terms differ (mixture of orders vs single ζ^{L-1}), and Candidate 1 contains an extra (1/2)^L sum absent in Candidate 2. Unless very specific, unstated identifications (such as \tilde N₀ = 1/L and collapse of the sum) are made, the two PDFs are not the same.

• Candidate 2: V = 1/(1/0.5 + 1/0.5) = 1/4 = 0.25

The two expressions are not obviously the same.

• Candidate 1 is an explicit finite geometric sum whose last term is fixed by the floor function.

• Candidate 2 is written as (a^ overline{ℓ} – a^{m}) / (1 – a^{-(t+1)}), but the symbol m is never defined, so the lower-limit exponent is ambiguous.  
Without a definition of m, one cannot verify that this numerator equals the last term implied by the floor in Candidate 1, nor even that m is independent of t or of the remainder when (overline{ℓ} – underline{ℓ}) is divided by t+1.

Because Candidate 2 leaves an essential quantity unspecified, the two candidates cannot be declared equivalent.
The two candidates give different closed-form expressions:

Candidate 1:  Σ_{j=0}^{⌊( \overline{ℓ}-\underline{ℓ} )/(t+1)⌋} a^{\,\overline{ℓ}-j(t+1)}

Candidate 2:  a^{\overline{ℓ}}

Unless ⌊( \overline{ℓ}-\underline{ℓ} )/(t+1)⌋ = 0 (so the sum has only one term), Candidate 1’s value exceeds Candidate 2’s. Hence, in general, the two predictions are not equivalent.
The two expressions are not generally equal.

Candidate 1:  Σ_{j=0}^{⌊( \overlineℓ − \underlineℓ )/(t+1)⌋} a^{ \overlineℓ − j(t+1)}

Candidate 2:  a^{ \overlineℓ}

Unless the upper and lower allowed lengths differ by less than t + 1 (so that the floor index is zero), Candidate 1 sums more than one term and therefore exceeds a^{ \overlineℓ}. Hence, except for that special case, the two candidates give different values.

For generic choices of the parameters (a, \underline{ℓ}, \overline{ℓ}, t) the sum in Candidate 1 produces multiple exponential terms, whereas Candidate 2 gives a single exponential term.

Candidate 1: ∑ max(0, |D_i∩𝔽| − r)

Candidate 2: ∑ max(0, |D_i∩𝔽| − r + 1)

For any index where |D_i∩𝔽| = r, the first summand contributes 0 while the second contributes 1. More generally, whenever |D_i∩𝔽| > r, the second summand exceeds the first by exactly 1. Hence the two totals differ in general, so the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different formulas:

• Candidate 1 uses ceilings of fractions of k and produces a piece-wise sum that, for ℓ=1, already yields at least ⌈k/2⌉ ≥ 5 when k ≥ 9.  
• Candidate 2 claims the value is simply 2ℓ (for ℓ≤a_k) or k (for ℓ≥a_k+1).

Candidate 1 fixes the residue class to be ℓ ≡ ⌊n/2⌋ (mod t + 1), so it is one specific sum of q-binomial coefficients.

Candidate 2 gives a sum over all k that satisfy k ≡ r (mod t + 1) where r is left as a free residue class, not tied to ⌊n/2⌋. Unless r is explicitly set to be ⌊n/2⌋ (mod t + 1), the two formulas represent different quantities in general.

Because Candidate 2 does not specify that r equals ⌊n/2⌋ (mod t + 1), the two candidates are not necessarily the same expression.

Candidate 1 fixes a single residue class (ℓ ≡ ⌊n/2⌋ mod (t+1)) and sums the corresponding q-binomials.

Candidate 2 considers every residue class r mod (t+1), computes the same kind of sum for each, and then takes the maximum over r.

Because Candidate 2 may pick a residue class different from ⌊n/2⌋ if that gives a larger sum, the two expressions coincide only in special cases, not in general. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

C = (1 − 1/N) / (1 − 1/N^{K/D})

Candidate 2 gives  
C = (1 − D/N) / (1 − (D/N)^{K/D})

Unless D = 1, the numerators (1 − 1/N) and (1 − D/N) are different, and the denominators likewise differ. Because the problem allows general D (only requiring D | K), the two formulas are not the same in general. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are

       = (1 – 1/N) ⁄ (1 – (1/N)^{K – D + 1})

Aside from the common factor (1 – 1/N) in the numerator, the denominators differ:

• Candidate 1 uses exponent K/D  
• Candidate 2 uses exponent K – D + 1

Since, in general, K/D ≠ K – D + 1 (except for the special case K = D), the two formulas are not the same. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

For any real number x, we have
 ceil(x + 1) = ceil(x) + 1,
because adding 1 shifts the argument of the ceiling function by exactly one unit.  
Therefore, for every integer n ≥ 1,

⌈2 √n + 1⌉ = ⌈2 √n⌉ + 1.

Hence Candidate 2 is always exactly 1 larger than Candidate 1, so the two answers are never equal. They are not equivalent per the rules.

The two formulas are structurally very different.

Candidate 1

k = ⌈ –ln(δ′/2)/(2 ε′²) ⌉, ε′ = ε/(N T), δ′ = δ/(N K).

After substituting ε′ and δ′ (ignoring the outer ceilings for comparison), the leading factor inside the max is approximately
k N K ≈ N³K T² ln(2N K/δ)/(2 ε²),
so the two arguments of the max become of order  
(i) N³K T² ln(2N K/δ)/(2 ε³)  
(ii) N³K T² ln(2N K/δ)/(4 ε⁴) (plus a small additive term).

Multiplying by the outside T gives expressions that scale like T³/ε³ or T³/ε⁴.

Candidate 2  
C = N³K T³ ln(2N K/δ)/(2 ε²).

This scales as T³/ε² and has no max, no ceilings, and no extra subtraction of ln δ in the numerator.

Because the ε-dependence (ε² vs ε³ or ε⁴), the presence/absence of the max, subtraction terms, and the ceiling operators all differ, the two expressions cannot be algebraically the same.

The two candidates give different algebraic expressions:

Unless \(W_A = W_B\) (which is not generally true), the two expressions differ. Even in the special case \(u=1\), the non-zero term is attached to \(W_A\) in Candidate 1 but to \(W_B\) in Candidate 2.

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different formulas for the even-n case.

For n = 2k (even):

• Candidate 1: I₂k = (2k)! · 2^{-(2k+1)} β(2k+1)

• Candidate 2: I₂k = 2 · (2k)! β(2k+1)

These are equal only if 2^{-(2k+1)} = 2, i.e. 2^{2k+1} = 1/2, which is impossible for natural k. A quick check with k = 0 (n = 0) already shows a discrepancy: Candidate 1 gives π/8, Candidate 2 gives π/2.

Thus the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas for the even-n case.

Let n = 2k (k ≥ 0).

• Candidate 1: I_{2k} = (2k)! / 2^{2k+1} · β(2k+1)

• Candidate 2: I_{2k} = 2 · (2k)! · β(2k+1)

Their ratio is

   Candidate 2 / Candidate 1 = [2 · (2k)! · β] / [(2k)! / 2^{2k+1} · β] = 2^{2k+2}

which is not 1 for any k ≥ 0.  
(For example, when n = 0, Candidate 1 gives π/8 while Candidate 2 gives π/2.)

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  

Iₙ = 0 for n odd

Candidate 2 gives  

Iₙ = (1 + (−1)ⁿ) · n! · β(n + 1).

For n odd:  
Candidate 1 ⇒ 0, Candidate 2 ⇒ (1 + (−1)) = 0, so both give 0.

For n even (n = 2k):  
Candidate 1 ⇒ (2k)! / 2^{2k+1} · β(2k+1)  
Candidate 2 ⇒ 2 · (2k)! · β(2k+1).

These differ by the constant factor 2^{2k+2}. Therefore the two formulas are not the same (they even give different values for n = 0).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two answers express the same numerical value.

Because  
arccot(2√2) = arctan(1/(2√2))  
and, using the identity arcsin y = arctan (y / √(1−y²)), we have  
arcsin(1/3) = arctan(1 / √8) = arctan(1/(2√2)).

Thus arccot(2√2) = arcsin(1/3).  Both candidates multiply this common angle by 1/√2, so

(1/√2) arccot(2√2) = (1/√2) arcsin(1/3).

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

Candidate 2: \(\displaystyle \tilde{\vec{f}}(\vec{k}) = +\,4\pi i\,\frac{\vec{k}}{|\vec{k}|^{2}}\times\tilde{\vec{A}}(\vec{k})\)

The two candidates give completely different Meijer-G representations:

• Candidate 2:  a^{-s}\, G^{3,1}_{2,3}\!\left(a\ \Big|\ \begin{array}{c}1,\,1\\[2pt]0,\,0,\,s\end{array}\right)

They differ in
1. the overall prefactor (1/(4π^{3/2}) vs a^{-s}),
2. the argument of the G-function (a^{2}/4 vs a),
3. the orders and parameters of the G-functions themselves.

Since these expressions are not the same (and there is no hidden simple identity that would transform one into the other), the two answers are not equivalent.
The two expressions differ substantially:

1. Different Meijer-G types and arguments  
   • Candidate 1: G₍3,5₎^{5,2}(a²/4)  
   • Candidate 2: G₍3,2₎^{1,3}(1/a)

2. Different parameter lists inside each G function.

3. Different overall prefactors (1/(4 π^{3/2}) versus a^{–s}).

Because no standard Meijer-G identity can simultaneously transform the order, swap the parameters, change the argument from a²/4 to 1/a, and convert the prefactors, the two results cannot be equivalent.

Both candidate answers are real numbers.

• Candidate 1: π  
• Candidate 2: π ( erf(eᵉ) )²

Compute an approximate value for Candidate 2:

eᵉ ≈ 15.1543.  
For such a large argument, erf(15.1543) = 1 − O(10⁻¹⁰¹).  
Hence (erf(eᵉ))² = 1 − O(10⁻¹⁰¹).

Therefore  
π ( erf(eᵉ) )² = π · [1 − O(10⁻¹⁰¹)]  
= π − O(10⁻¹⁰¹).

The difference between the two candidates is on the order of 10⁻¹⁰¹, far smaller than 10⁻⁶ π.  
Thus, up to 6 significant digits,

π = 3.14159 …  
π ( erf(eᵉ) )² = 3.14159 … (identical through at least 6 digits).

By Rule 4, if two numerical answers agree to 6 significant digits, they are regarded as equivalent.

Both candidates propose a single numerical value for the integral.

Candidate 1: π ≈ 3.14159 265…

Candidate 2: π [erf(eᵉ)]²

For eᵉ ≈ 15.1543, erf(eᵉ) = 1 – O(10⁻¹⁰²), so
π [erf(eᵉ)]² = π (1 – O(10⁻¹⁰²)) ≈ 3.14159 265…
The difference from π is on the order of 10⁻¹⁰², far beyond the 6-significant-digit threshold.

According to Rule 4, two numerical answers that agree to 6 significant digits are considered equivalent. Here they agree to far more than 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are regarded as equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different expressions:

• Candidate 1: π  
• Candidate 2: π [erf(eᵉ)]²

Since erf(eᵉ) is less than 1 for any finite argument, [erf(eᵉ)]² ≠ 1, so π [erf(eᵉ)]² ≠ π. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the equation

(1 − c)(π − arccos(1 − c)) + sin(arccos(1 − c)) = π/2,

but in Candidate 2 the term sin(arccos(1 − c)) has been replaced by √(2c − c²).  
Since for θ = arccos(1 − c) (with c ∈ (0, 1)) we have

sin θ = √(1 − cos² θ) = √(1 − (1 − c)²) = √(2c − c²),

the substitution is exact. Therefore the two equations are mathematically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give equations that differ only by multiplying both sides by 2 and by using the identity  
sin(arccos(1 − c)) = √(1 − (1 − c)²) = √(2c − c²).

Applying these observations converts Candidate 1 precisely into Candidate 2 and vice-versa, so they are mathematically the same implicit equation.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the equation

(1 − c)(π − arccos(1 − c)) + √(2c − c²) = π/2,

Candidate 1 gives e^{-a z} H_0^{(1)}(z), while Candidate 2 gives -4 i e^{-a z} K_0(z).  
H_0^{(1)}(z) (Hankel function of the first kind) and K_0(z) (modified Bessel function of the second kind) are different special functions for real positive argument z, and no simple constant factor converts one into the other. The additional multiplicative factor −4 i in Candidate 2 cannot bridge that functional difference. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers give different special-function expressions:

• Candidate 1: e^{-az} H₀^{(1)}(z)  
• Candidate 2: 2 e^{-az} K₀(z)

For real positive argument z, the Hankel function H₀^{(1)}(z) (J₀ + iY₀) is generally complex, whereas the modified Bessel function K₀(z) is real and cannot be obtained from H₀^{(1)}(z) by the simple factor 2. Hence the two expressions are not equal.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single closed-form expression for the same integral, but they are not the same expression.

• Candidate 1: e^{-az}\,H_0^{(1)}(z), where H_0^{(1)}(z)=J_0(z)+iY_0(z).

• Candidate 2: 2π\,e^{-az}\,J_0(z).

Because
 H_0^{(1)}(z)=J_0(z)+iY_0(z) and there is no general constant c such that H_0^{(1)}(z)=c\,J_0(z),
and because candidate 2 also carries an extra numerical factor 2π, the two results differ both by an imaginary Y_0 term and by the overall magnitude.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives I = 8 G − π²⁄2  
Candidate 2 gives I = 4 G − π²⁄2

The coefficients of G differ (8 vs 4). Since G is a fixed non-zero constant defined by the integral in the problem, these expressions are not identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different explicit formulas:

Candidate 1: I = 8 G − π²/2  
Candidate 2: I = 4 G

These can only be the same if 8 G − π²/2 = 4 G, i.e. if 4 G = π²/2.  Nothing in the problem statement or in the definition of G guarantees that equality, so the two expressions are not generally identical. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give real-number expressions, so we compare their numerical values (Rule 4).

Candidate 1: π √[10(√5 + 5)]
 √5 ≈ 2.236068  
 10(√5 + 5) ≈ 72.3606798  
 √(72.3606798) ≈ 8.506508  
 Value ≈ π × 8.506508 ≈ 26.72398

Candidate 2: 5π / sin(π/5)
 sin(π/5) = sin 36° = √(10 − 2√5)/4 ≈ 0.58778525  
 Value ≈ 5π / 0.58778525 ≈ 26.72398

The two numbers match to six significant digits (26.7239 …), and an algebraic check confirms
 5π / sin(π/5) = π √[10(√5 + 5)].

Hence the predictions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions can be shown algebraically to be the same number:

sin(π/5) = sin 36° = √(10 − 2√5) / 4  

Candidate 2  
5π / sin(π/5) = 5π / [√(10 − 2√5)/4] = 20π / √(10 − 2√5)

Candidate 1  
π √[10(√5 + 5)] = π √(50 + 10√5)

But  
(20 / √(10 − 2√5))² = 400 / (10 − 2√5)  
                   = 400(10 + 2√5) / [100 − (2√5)²]  
                   = 5(10 + 2√5)  
                   = 50 + 10√5.

Hence  
20 / √(10 − 2√5) = √(50 + 10√5),

so

20π / √(10 − 2√5) = π √(50 + 10√5).

Therefore

Candidate 1 = Candidate 2.

Both expressions are identical once the logarithm properties are applied:

Candidate 1:  
log [ (2a+1)^{2a+1} (2b+1)^{2b+1} / (a+b+1)^{2(a+b+1)} ]  
 = (2a+1) log(2a+1) + (2b+1) log(2b+1) − 2(a+b+1) log(a+b+1)

Candidate 2 is exactly that expanded form. Assuming “log” denotes the natural logarithm (same as “ln”), the two candidates give the same value.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions are identical, since

= (2a+1) log(2a+1) + (2b+1) log(2b+1) − 2(a+b+1) log(a+b+1).

 f_Z(z) =  3 / (z+3)².  

The two expressions differ by a minus sign, so they are not equal (and Candidate 1’s density would even be negative, which is impossible for a pdf).

• For part (2) both give the same expression 1 / [π(1+z²)].

The two candidates both give a single numerical expression.

Candidate 1:  log(3) − 1/4  
Candidate 2:  ln 3 − 1/4

In standard mathematical writing, “log” without a specified base is normally understood to be the natural logarithm (the same as “ln”), unless the context explicitly indicates a different base. No alternative base is indicated in the problem statement. Therefore log 3 and ln 3 denote the same quantity here. Subtracting the identical constant 1/4 from each leaves the two expressions identical.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates both give the value

   (natural logarithm of 3)  −  1/4 .

Candidate 1 writes this as “log(3) − 1/4,” Candidate 2 as “ln 3 − 1/4.”  
In standard mathematical notation, especially in calculus and analysis where no base is specified, “log” is understood to denote the natural logarithm. Hence “log(3)” and “ln 3” represent the same quantity.

Because the expressions are otherwise identical, the two answers are equivalent.
The two candidates differ in their logarithm notation.

• Candidate 1 uses “log(3)”, whose base is not specified and therefore is ambiguous (it could be natural, base 10, or something else, depending on convention).

• Candidate 2 uses “ln 3”, which unambiguously denotes the natural logarithm.

Because one answer is explicit while the other is ambiguous, the two results cannot be guaranteed to represent the same numerical value. Hence, according to Rule 1 (units/definitions ambiguity), the answers are not equivalent.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give exactly the same mathematical expression:

Candidate 1: 2 ln(2 / r) − γ  
Candidate 2: 2 ln(2 / r) − γ

Hence they are equivalent.

Both answers represent the same mathematical object: the zero vector in ℝ².

• Candidate 1 writes “0”.  
• Candidate 2 writes “(0, 0)”.

In contexts where the result is a vector, writing “0” is universally understood to denote the zero vector; “(0, 0)” is simply its coordinate form. Since they refer to the identical element and no other distinctions (units, number of components, etc.) are relevant, the two predictions are equivalent.

The problem asks for the derivative \(Df(0)\), which is a linear functional from \(\mathbb{R}^n\) to \(\mathbb{R}\).  
Candidate 1 explicitly gives that functional: \(Df(0)(x)=\langle v,x\rangle\).  
Candidate 2 simply states \(v\).

In the standard identification of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) with its dual via the Euclidean inner product, giving the vector \(v\) is exactly the same as giving the functional \(x\mapsto\langle v,x\rangle\). Thus both answers convey the same mathematical object and are understood as equivalent descriptions of the derivative at 0.

Candidate 1 gives the result  
 Γ(z) e^(−i π z / 2),  
whereas Candidate 2 gives  
 Γ(z) e^(+i π z / 2).

Since e^(−i π z / 2) ≠ e^(+i π z / 2) for a general complex z (with Re z > 1), the two expressions are not the same. Therefore the two candidates’ answers are inequivalent.

The two answers differ by a complex phase factor:

Candidate 1: Γ(z) e^{−i π z / 2}  
Candidate 2: Γ(z) e^{+i π z / 2}

Since e^{−i π z / 2} ≠ e^{+i π z / 2} for a general complex z (with Re z > 1), the two expressions are not the same.

Both answers assert that the value of the function is identically zero in the neighborhood of 0.

• Candidate 1: explicitly states “f(x) = 0 for all x in the neighborhood of 0.”  
• Candidate 2: simply states “0,” which, in the context of asking for the value of f(x), conveys the same information—that f(x) equals zero.

No units are involved, and the question only requires this single piece of information. Therefore, the two candidates give the same answer.

The two candidates give different numerical values:

Candidate 1: π² / 5 ≈ 1.97392  
Candidate 2: 5 π² / 24 ≈ 2.05617

They differ already in the first two decimal places, so they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different numerical values:
• Candidate 1: π² / 5 ≈ 0.2 π²  
• Candidate 2: π² / 6 ≈ 0.166666… π²  

Since 0.2 π² ≠ 0.166666… π², the answers are not equal.

The two candidates give different numerical values:

The two candidate expressions are not equivalent.

A direct comparison shows that, after expanding logarithms, Candidate 1 evaluates to  

I₁ = (1/24) ln 2 + (1/16) ln π + (1/4) ln A − (7/32) ζ(3)/π²  

whereas Candidate 2 is  

I₂ = (1/8) ln 2 + (1/8) ln π − (1/4) ln A + (1/2) ζ′(−1).

These differ in the coefficients of ln 2, ln π, ln A, and in that I₁ contains a ζ(3)/π² term while I₂ contains ζ′(−1). Numerical evaluation confirms they give different values (I₁ ≈ 0.136; I₂ ≈ 0.0848). Hence the two predictions are not the same.
The two expressions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 simplifies to
(1/4) ln A + (1/24) ln 2 + (1/16) ln π − (7/32) ζ(3)/π².

Candidate 2 equals
(1/4) ln A + (1/24) ln 2 − (1/48) ln π − (7/32) ζ(3)/π².

The coefficients of ln π differ ( +1/16 vs. –1/48 ), so the results cannot be the same.

Candidate 2:  \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}\,e^{\frac{b^2}{4a}}

Because multiplication is commutative, these two forms are identical.

The two expressions differ only in the exponent of (−1):

• Candidate 1: 2(−1)^{\,n−1}/(2n−1)  
• Candidate 2: 2(−1)^{\,n+1}/(2n−1)

Since (−1)^{n+1} = (−1)^{n−1}·(−1)^2 = (−1)^{n−1}·1 = (−1)^{n−1}, the two factors are identical.  
All other parts (the factor 2 and the denominator 2n−1) are the same.

Therefore the two candidates give exactly the same value for every integer n ≥ 1.

The question asks for a single numerical answer (maximum height).  
Candidate 1 gives 680 m, Candidate 2 gives 667.13 m.  
Same units, but the numerical values differ. Comparing to 6 significant digits:  

• 680 m → 6.80000 × 10²  
• 667.13 m → 6.67130 × 10²  

They are clearly not equal.

Candidate 1 gives the perihelion distance as  
8.8 × 10¹⁰ m.

Candidate 2 gives the perihelion distance as  
0.59 AU.

Convert 0.59 AU to metres (1 AU ≈ 1.496 × 10¹¹ m):

0.59 AU ≈ 0.59 × 1.496 × 10¹¹ m ≈ 8.8264 × 10¹0 m.

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 8.80000 × 10¹0 m  
• Candidate 2: 8.82640 × 10¹0 m

They do not match to six significant digits.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
To compare the two answers we must bring them to the same unit.

1 AU ≈ 1.496 × 10¹¹ m.

Candidate 2:  
0.59 AU = 0.59 × 1.496 × 10¹¹ m ≈ 8.836 × 10¹⁰ m.

Candidate 1:  
8.8 × 10¹⁰ m.

Express both with six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1 → 8.80000 × 10¹⁰ m  
• Candidate 2 → 8.83600 × 10¹⁰ m

Since 8.80000 ≠ 8.83600 at six significant digits, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 202 km (i.e., 202 000 m).  
Candidate 2 gives 201400 with no unit stated. The missing unit makes the answer ambiguous (meters, kilometres, etc.), and even if we interpret 201400 as metres, the numerical values 202 000 m and 201 400 m differ and do not match to six significant digits.   

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 2.24 × 10⁷ s  
Convert to days: 2.24 × 10⁷ s ÷ 86 400 s /day = 259.259 … days

Candidate 2: 259 days (which is 259.000 … days if written with six significant digits).

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1: 259.259 days  
• Candidate 2: 259.000 days  

They differ beginning with the fourth significant digit, so they are not identical to six-significant-digit precision.

Therefore, per the guidelines the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives an explicit numerical value in degrees: 48.189685 °.

Candidate 2 gives the symbolic expression  cos⁻¹(2/3) without indicating units.  In mathematics, inverse-trigonometric functions return a value in radians unless another unit is specified.  Hence cos⁻¹(2/3) is ordinarily interpreted as ≈0.841069 rad, which is not the same numerical value as 48.189685 °.  

Because one answer is in degrees and the other is implicitly in radians (and the unit is omitted, leading to ambiguity), the two responses are not unequivocally the same.  Under Rule 1, this unit ambiguity makes the answers inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
48.189685° (Candidate 1) equals arccos(2/3) expressed in degrees.  
Converting Candidate 2’s arccos(2/3):

arccos(2/3) ≈ 0.841068671 rad  
0.841068671 rad × 57.2957795 (deg/rad) ≈ 48.189685 deg

Thus both answers represent the same angle to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates express the same numerical angle only if Candidate 2’s inverse–cosine is interpreted in degrees.  
However, an inverse–trigonometric expression without a specified unit is ambiguous, because the angle could equally well be taken in radians (0.84107 rad) or in degrees (48.1897°).  
Since the question allows either unit (angles are commonly given in degrees or radians) and Candidate 2 omits a unit altogether, Rule 1 says that the answers are considered inequivalent when such ambiguity exists.

Candidate 1 gives an answer of 7.25 % (a percentage).  
Candidate 2 gives an answer of 0.0725 (a pure decimal).  

Converting Candidate 1’s percentage to a decimal: 7.25 % = 7.25 / 100 = 0.0725.  
Both candidates therefore represent the identical numerical value.

Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

The question specifically asks for the “frequency of the motion.”  

• Candidate 1 gives “0.7854 s,” a time interval (seconds), which corresponds to the period, not the frequency.  
• Candidate 2 gives “4/π Hz,” explicitly a frequency (hertz = s⁻¹).

Although 1 /(0.7854 s) ≈ 1.27324 Hz ≈ 4/π Hz, the two candidates present different physical quantities (period vs. frequency). Because the required unit/quantity is frequency, the answers are not considered equivalent under Rule 1.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reason: Candidate 1 explicitly gives the mass as “4 slugs,” specifying a unit. Candidate 2 gives only the number “4” with no unit. Because the question involves physical units (mass), omitting the unit introduces ambiguity—different units (slug, kg, lb-mass, etc.) could reasonably be considered.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical value: 0.2244 s.  
Candidate 2 gives the exact expression π/14 (no unit stated).  

1. Converting π/14 to a decimal (seconds) gives  
   π/14 ≈ 0.224399 s.

2. Compare to six significant digits (Rule 4):
   • Candidate 1: 0.224400  
   • Candidate 2: 0.224399  
   These differ at the 6-significant-digit level (…400 vs …399).

3. Units: Candidate 1 explicitly uses seconds; Candidate 2 omits the unit. Even if we assume seconds, the numerical values still differ at the required precision.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates represent numerical answers for the same physical quantity (time).

• Candidate 1: 0.2244 s  
  – expressed explicitly in seconds.

• Candidate 2: π/14  
  – by context this also represents seconds; numerically,
    π/14 ≈ 0.224399475…

To test equivalence we compare the numerical values to 6 significant digits as required by Rule 4:

• Candidate 1 interpreted to 6 significant digits is 0.224400  
• Candidate 2 to 6 significant digits is 0.224399

They differ at the 4-th significant digit (“4” vs “3”), hence they are not identical to 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Reasoning:

The quantity to compare is a time.

• Candidate 1: 0.2244 s  
  – Interpreted to six significant digits: 0.224400

• Candidate 2: π/14  
  – Numerical value: π/14 ≈ 0.224399 s  
  – Six significant digits: 0.224399

Comparing 0.224400 with 0.224399, they differ at the 6-th significant digit.  
Rule 4 requires exact agreement to six significant digits; therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two answers give the decay-rate in different time units, so first convert candidate 1 to the same unit as candidate 2:

0.02828 day⁻¹ × 7 days/week = 0.19796 week⁻¹.

Now compare the numbers to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1 (converted): 0.197960  
• Candidate 2:            0.198000

They differ at the third significant digit (7 vs 8), so they are not identical to 6 significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 0.02828 day⁻¹  
Candidate 2: 0.198 week⁻¹

Convert Candidate 2 to day⁻¹:

Express both answers to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 0.0282800  
• Candidate 2 → 0.0282857

They differ at the 5th significant digit (…0282800 vs …0282857).

• Candidate 2 → 428.1349 ≈ 4.28135 × 10² (6-sig-fig rounding)

The sequences 4 2 8 1 6 0 and 4 2 8 1 3 5 differ in the 5th and 6th significant digits. Therefore, the two answers are not equal to 6 significant digits.

Reasoning:
1. Units: Candidate 1 gives 0.0408 with no unit, while Candidate 2 gives 2/49 kg m⁻¹. The units do not match (missing unit vs. kg/m), so per Rule 1 they are inequivalent.
2. Numerical comparison: Even if we ignore units and compare numbers, 0.0408 (interpreted as 0.040800 to six significant digits) differs from 2/49 ≈ 0.040816. They do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4).

Convert to inches: 0.18162 ft × 12 in/ft = 2.17944 in.

Candidate 2 gives (√19)/2 in ≈ 2.179449 in.

Compare the two values in the same unit (inches) to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 2.17944 → 2.17944  
• Candidate 2: 2.179449… → 2.17945 (to 6 significant digits)

Since 2.17944 ≠ 2.17945 at the sixth significant digit, the two answers are not identical to 6 significant digits, as required by Rule 4.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
0.18162 ft  ≈ 0.181620 ft  
(√19)/2 in  = (√19)/2 ÷ 12 ft ≈ 0.18162079 ft → rounded to six significant digits: 0.181621 ft  

Comparing to six significant digits, 0.181620 ≠ 0.181621.

Both candidates give a single numerical value for the phase angle.

• Candidate 1: –0.40864 rad  
• Candidate 2: 5.875  (no unit stated, but the context implies radians)

These two angles differ by approximately 5.875 − (–0.40864) = 6.28364 rad, which is essentially 2π rad (6.283185 rad). An angle and that same angle plus an integer multiple of 2π represent the identical physical phase. Hence –0.40864 rad and 5.875 rad are mathematically equivalent phase angles (the small ≈0.00045 rad discrepancy is just rounding).

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 2 states 8.55 g, i.e. 8.55000 to 6 significant digits.

Comparing 8.55306 vs 8.55000, the numbers differ in the fourth decimal place, so they do not match to 6 significant digits as required by Rule 4. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for a single numerical answer: the magnitude of the acceleration expressed in g units.

Candidate 1 supplies 83.81 m/s² (explicit unit: m/s²).

Step 1 – Unit reconciliation (Rule 1):  
Convert Candidate 1’s result to g‐units:  
83.81 m/s² ÷ 9.81 (m/s² per g) ≈ 8.54547 g.

Candidate 1 (after conversion): 8.54547 g  
Candidate 2:           8.55000 g  
The two values differ in the 3rd–4th decimal place; they are not identical to six significant digits.

Step 3 – Additional discrepancy:

Both candidates give a single numerical magnitude in newtons, but:

Candidate 1: 2.6 × 10⁻¹⁰ N  → 2.60000 × 10⁻¹⁰ N (to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 2.56 × 10⁻¹⁰ N → 2.56000 × 10⁻¹⁰ N (to 6 significant digits)

The values differ already in the second significant digit, so they are not identical to six significant figures.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, –1.0, for the x-coordinate.  
The problem’s coordinates are expressed in centimeters, so the implicit unit for Candidate 2 is also cm. Therefore, the inclusion of “cm” by Candidate 1 and its omission by Candidate 2 do not create ambiguity: there is only one reasonable unit here. The two answers represent the same quantity.

We compare the single numerical answers.

• Both use the same unit (m s⁻²).

• Values:  
  – Candidate 1: 3.51 × 10¹⁵  
  – Candidate 2: 3.52 × 10¹⁵

To be equivalent they must match to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).  

3.51 × 10¹⁵ ≠ 3.52 × 10¹⁵ already at the third significant digit, so they fail the 6-digit comparison.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two answers have the same units (m/s), so compare the numerical values.

Candidate 1: 2.19 × 10⁶ m/s  
Candidate 2: 2.188 × 10⁶ m/s  

Expressed to six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 → 2.19000 × 10⁶  
• Candidate 2 → 2.18800 × 10⁶  

They differ beginning at the third decimal place, so they do not match to six significant digits.

Candidate 1: 122 mA = 0.122 A  
Candidate 2: 0.12 (no unit given → ambiguous, but if assumed amperes it is 0.12 A)

Even if we assume amperes for Candidate 2, the numerical values are different:
0.122000 ≠ 0.120000 (they differ at the third significant digit, violating Rule 4).

Moreover, the omission of a unit in Candidate 2 introduces ambiguity (Rule 1).

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives “2.7 10⁶” with no unit.  
Candidate 2 gives “2.7 × 10⁶ m/s”.

Because Candidate 1 omits the unit, and the problem is about speed (for which several units could be used), the omission introduces ambiguity. Under Rule 1, this makes the two answers not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives only the number “2.7 × 10⁶” with no unit, while Candidate 2 gives “2.7 × 10⁶ m/s.”  
Because the question asks for a speed and the unit is essential, the omission of the unit in Candidate 1 introduces ambiguity. Under Rule 1, answers with missing required units are not considered equivalent to answers that include them.

Both answers express the coordinate as a multiple of L, so units match.  
Numerically:

• Candidate 1: 2.72 L → 2.72000 (to 6 significant digits)

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4), 2.72000 ≠ 2.72076. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 8.99 × 10⁹ N

Express both to 6 significant digits with the same exponent (10⁹):

• Candidate 1 → 8.99000 × 10⁹ N  
• Candidate 2 → 8.98800 × 10⁹ N  

Comparing the six significant digits:  
8.99000 ≠ 8.98800 (they differ starting at the third decimal place).

Thus, by Rule 4 the two numerical answers are not identical to 6 significant digits, so the candidates are not equivalent.

Both predictions are giving the same numerical value:

• Candidate 1: “6.3 $10^{11}$” – this is standard shorthand for 6.3 × 10¹¹ (just missing an explicit “×” symbol).
• Candidate 2: “6.3 × 10¹¹”.

Thus the mantissa (6.3) and the exponent (10¹¹) match exactly, the quantity is dimensionless (a count of electrons), and the question asks for only one answer. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 1.34 × 10⁷ C (i.e., 1.34000 × 10⁷)

Applying Rule 4 (compare to 6 significant digits), the values 1.30000 and 1.34000 differ already in the third digit. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 explicitly writes “1.5 × 10³ N/C.”

Thus both denote the numerical value 1.5 × 10³ = 1500 N/C, matching to at least six significant digits. Therefore the two predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates both give the potential-energy value in joules, and the numerical value in each is –1.49 × 10⁻²⁶ J (candidate 1 lacks the explicit “×”, but the intent is clearly the same scientific-notation form). The numbers match to six significant digits, and the units are identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single numerical value with the same unit (joules).

Candidate 1: “−1.49 10⁻²⁶ J”
Candidate 2: “−1.49 × 10⁻²⁶ J”

The only difference is the explicit “×” symbol; both clearly denote −1.49 × 10⁻²⁶ J.  
Comparing to 6 significant digits, both correspond to −1.49000 × 10⁻²⁶ J, so they match.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

• the same unit, C (coulombs)

Although candidate 1 omits the explicit “×” symbol, its format “-1.32 10¹³ C” clearly means “-1.32 × 10¹³ C”, so the numerical value is identical.  
To six significant digits both are −1.32000 × 10¹³ C, so they match.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

• Candidate 2 explicitly writes 5.5 × 10^3, also 5500.

Candidate 1 gives 85 g mol⁻¹, while Candidate 2 gives 84.9 g mol⁻¹.  
Expressing both to six significant digits: 85 → 85.0000 and 84.9 → 84.9000.  
These numbers differ at the first decimal place, so they are not equal to six significant digits.

Both answers describe the same numerical quantity.

• Candidate 1: 0.42 pm  
 0.42 pm = 0.42 × 10⁻¹² m = 4.20 × 10⁻¹³ m

• Candidate 2: 4.20 × 10⁻¹³ m

After unit conversion, both are 4.20 × 10⁻¹³ m. Expressed to six significant digits, both can be written as 4.20000 × 10⁻¹³ m, so they match exactly.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers denote the same physical quantity.

Conversion check:
0.42 pm = 0.42 × 10⁻¹² m = 4.2 × 10⁻¹³ m

Candidate 1 (0.42 pm) equals Candidate 2 (4.2 × 10⁻¹³ m).  
Hence, the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 272.8 K.  
Candidate 2 gives –0.35 °C.

Converting –0.35 °C to kelvin:  –0.35 °C + 273.15 = 272.80 K.  
This matches 272.8 K to at least six significant digits (272.800 K).

Therefore the two answers represent the same numerical value for the melting point.

Candidate 1: –6.04697 eV  
Candidate 2: –6.04 eV  (= –6.04000 eV when written to six significant digits)

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: –6.04697  
• Candidate 2: –6.04000  

They differ at the 4th significant digit (6 ≠ 0). Hence the two answers are not numerically identical. Units are the same, so no unit conversion affects the conclusion.

Both answers represent the same numerical value expressed in different but compatible units.

• Candidate 1: 226 pm  
  1 pm = 10⁻¹² m → 226 pm = 226 × 10⁻¹² m = 2.26 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

• Candidate 2: 2.26 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

After converting Candidate 1 to metres, the two results are identical (2.26 × 10⁻¹⁰ m). Hence they are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 226 pm  
→ 226 pm = 226 × 10⁻¹² m = 2.26 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Candidate 2: 2.25 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
→ 2.25 × 10⁻¹⁰ m = 225 pm

Comparing the numeric values in the same unit:

• Candidate 1: 2.26000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
• Candidate 2: 2.25000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

The numbers differ already at the third significant digit (2.26000 vs 2.25000) and therefore do not match to 6 significant digits, as required by Rule 4.

Hence, the two answers are not equivalent.

2.10 × 10⁻¹⁶ = 2.1 × 10⁻¹⁶ numerically; the extra zero in 2.10 only reflects additional significant‐figure precision. No units are involved (the requested answer is a dimensionless ratio). Hence, the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value (the ionization energy) in eV.  
Both candidates give such a value and use the same unit (eV).

Express each answer to six significant digits for strict comparison (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 15.425 eV → 15.4250 (six significant digits: 1 5 4 2 5 0)  
• Candidate 2: 15.427 eV → 15.4270 (six significant digits: 1 5 4 2 7 0)

The fifth significant digit differs (5 vs 7), so the two numbers do not match to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 supplies only the calculated energy (399 kJ mol⁻¹) and omits the explicit comparison with the 400 kJ mol⁻¹ bond energy, whereas Candidate 2 provides both the energy value (approximately 399 kJ mol⁻¹) and the required comparison (“very close ... thus comparable”).  

Because the question asks for two pieces of information (the energy and the comparison), Candidate 1 is missing one required part. According to Rule 2, when one candidate gives all required answers and the other does not, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: 141 J /mol

Expressed with six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 140.000 J /mol  
Candidate 2 → 141.000 J /mol

Since 140.000 ≠ 141.000, the answers do not match to six significant digits.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical value in SI units:  
1.61 × 10⁻²³ J T⁻¹.

Candidate 2 gives the answer symbolically:  
√3 μ_B.

Convert candidate 2 to the same unit:  
μ_B = 9.274 009 994 × 10⁻²⁴ J T⁻¹  
√3 μ_B ≈ 1.732 050 8 × 9.274 009 994 × 10⁻²⁴  
           ≈ 1.605 34 × 10⁻²³ J T⁻¹.

Now compare the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 1.610 00 × 10⁻²³  
• Candidate 2: 1.605 34 × 10⁻²³

They differ at the 4th significant digit (0 vs 5), so they do not match to 6 significant digits.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 1.6063 × 10⁻²³ →  1.60630 × 10⁻²³

Since 1.61000 ≠ 1.60630 to six significant digits, the two answers are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers give numerical values in the same units (J/T) but differ in the digits of the value.

Expressed to six significant digits:

The question asks for a single numerical value (the 0.01 quantile of an F‐distribution with df1=8, df2=4).  

Candidate 1 gives 14.80 (≈ 14.8000).  
Candidate 2 gives 14.69 (≈ 14.6900).

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4), 14.8000 ≠ 14.6900, so the answers are not the same.

Candidate 1 gives a decimal probability = 0.00024.  
Candidate 2 gives a fractional probability = 1/4165.

Convert Candidate 2 to decimal:
1 / 4165 ≈ 0.000240096 …  

Compare to Candidate 1’s 0.000240000 …  
Expressed with six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1: 0.000240000 → 2.40000 × 10⁻⁴  
• Candidate 2: 0.000240096 → 2.40096 × 10⁻⁴  

The values differ starting at the 5th significant digit, so they are not equal to 6 significant digits. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

Convert Candidate 2 to decimal:
7/30 = 0.233333… (repeating).

Compare to Candidate 1:
Candidate 1 = 0.23333333333.

The question requests a single numerical answer (how many molecules per second).  

Candidate 1 gives: 1.27 × 10⁶  
Candidate 2 gives: 1.3 × 10⁶  

Expressed with the same exponent and to six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 1.27000 × 10⁶  
Candidate 2 → 1.30000 × 10⁶  

The digits differ starting at the third decimal place (1.27000 vs 1.30000), so they are not identical to six significant digits. Therefore, according to Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates express the same quantity in different units:

• Candidate 1: 0.318 nm²  
   0.318 nm² = 0.318 × (10⁻⁹ m)² = 3.18 × 10⁻¹⁹ m²  

• Candidate 2: 3.18 × 10⁻¹⁹ m²

So numerically they coincide to the three significant digits given.

However, Rule 4 requires the answers to match to 6 significant digits. Each candidate provides only 3 significant digits, so a 6-digit comparison cannot be satisfied. Hence, per the guideline, they are considered inequivalent.

Both candidates give the numerical value 0.46, but:

• Candidate 1 explicitly states the unit “J” (joules).  
• Candidate 2 provides no unit at all.

According to Rule 1, when a unit is omitted and that omission can introduce ambiguity, the answers are considered inequivalent. The problem is about work, where the standard unit is joules, but without the unit the answer could in principle be interpreted differently (e.g., N m, J, or even an incorrect unit). Hence the omission causes ambiguity.

Therefore the two predictions are NOT equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 1.95 atm (unit specified).  
Candidate 2 gives the bare number 198 with no unit.

Both candidates give the same numerical value: 93.4.  
Candidate 1 explicitly appends the unit “bar,” while Candidate 2 omits any unit.  
Because the problem statement itself uses bar as the working unit for pressure (all given data involving pressure are in bar or bar-based units), the context strongly implies that the requested answer should also be expressed in bar. Hence the missing unit in Candidate 2 does not introduce a realistic ambiguity—the only reasonable interpretation is bar.  

Therefore, the two predictions are effectively the same.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: “93.4 bar”  
Candidate 2: “93.4” (unit omitted)

Rule 1 states that if a unit is omitted and multiple units could reasonably be used, the omission creates ambiguity and the answers are considered inequivalent. Pressure can reasonably be expressed in several units (bar, atm, Pa, etc.). Because Candidate 2 does not specify the unit, while Candidate 1 explicitly gives “bar,” the two answers are not unequivocally the same under the guidelines.

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 0.132000  
• Candidate 2 → 0.133000  

These values differ beginning at the third decimal place, so they do not match to six significant digits. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question expects a temperature value; both Kelvin and Celsius would be reasonable units for a boiling-point answer.  

• Candidate 1 explicitly gives “344 K”.  
• Candidate 2 gives “344” with no unit, creating ambiguity (it could be 344 K or 344 °C).

The two candidates use the same units (J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹).  
Expressed to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 146 → 146.000  
• Candidate 2: 146.3 → 146.300

Since 146.000 ≠ 146.300, the numerical values differ at the required six-significant-digit comparison.

Candidate 1: 24.4 J K⁻¹  → 24.4000 (to six significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 24.42 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ → 24.4200 (to six significant digits)

Even ignoring the slight unit difference (which could be reconciled because the process involves 1 mol), the numerical values differ at the third decimal place and therefore do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both answers express the same numerical value for the equilibrium pressure.

• Candidate 1: “1.51 10⁴ bar” → interpreted as 1.51 × 10⁴ bar = 15 100 bar  
• Candidate 2: “15100 bar” = 15 100 bar

Same unit (bar) and same magnitude; thus they are equivalent.

Both expressions can be rewritten in terms of ln 2 and ln 5:

Candidate 1  
ln((25 √5)/32)  
= ln 25 + ln √5 − ln 32  
= 2 ln 5 + (1/2) ln 5 − 5 ln 2  
= (5/2) ln 5 − 5 ln 2.

Candidate 2  
(5/2) ln(5/4)  
= (5/2)(ln 5 − ln 4)  
= (5/2) ln 5 − (5/2)(2 ln 2)  
= (5/2) ln 5 − 5 ln 2.

Since both simplify to the identical expression (5/2) ln 5 − 5 ln 2, the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
0.55785887828552… (Candidate 1) equals 0.55785887828552… (Candidate 2), so the two answers are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give

ln|tan x|  −  (3/2)(1/ tan²x)  −  (3/4)(1/ tan⁴x)  −  (1/6)(1/ tan⁶x)  +  C,

the only difference being that candidate 2 writes the reciprocal-powers as cot-powers. Since cot x = 1/ tan x, the two expressions are mathematically identical up to the arbitrary constant of integration.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give exactly the same antiderivative, merely written in a different order:

Candidate 1:  ln|tan x| − 3/(2 tan²x) − 3/(4 tan⁴x) − 1/(6 tan⁶x) + C  
Candidate 2:  ln|tan x| − 1/(6 tan⁶x) − 3/(4 tan⁴x) − 3/(2 tan²x) + C  

All coefficients, signs, and terms match; the constant of integration C is present in both. Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

According to Rule 4, when both answers are real numbers we must compare them to 6 significant digits.  
• Candidate 1: 2.7181  → 2.71810 (to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 2.718   → 2.71800 (to 6 significant digits)  

Since 2.71810 ≠ 2.71800, the two answers do not match exactly to 6 significant digits. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

These differ by the scalar factor θᵏ(b₀⁻¹). Because the question explicitly asks for a single generator polynomial (and mentions b₀, suggesting that the scalar factor is relevant), the two answers are not identical. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.  
Candidate 1 covers all possible situations, including the cases N = 1 and the zero multivector, and it can return the values 0 or 1.  
Candidate 2 only looks at j ∈ {2,…,N} for which C_{(j)}(T)≠0, so it can never return 0 or 1 and is undefined if that set is empty (e.g. when N = 1 or when all those coefficients vanish). Therefore the two prescriptions give different outputs in those situations.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different rules for computing rank (M).  
Example: if M is a non-zero vector (pure grade 1), then  
• Candidate 1 → rank(M)=1 (because C₍₁₎(M)≠0).  
• Candidate 2 → T = M†M is a scalar, so max{ j | C₍ⱼ₎(T)≠0 } = 0, hence rank(M)=0.  

Since they can yield different results, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 explicitly supplies four residues—0, 0, 0, 0—one for each of the four expressions.

The two answers give different analytic expressions.

• Candidate 2: Σ_{m=0}^∞ z^m q^m / (q;q)_m²  
  ⇒ expansion begins 1 + 1 z q + …

Since the coefficient of z q (and therefore the series themselves) differ, the two expressions cannot be identical. Thus the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not the same.  
A quick check with the coefficient of z¹ (set z = 1) already shows a mismatch:

• Candidate 1 gives

• Candidate 2 gives  
 q / (1 − q)² = q + 2 q² + 3 q³ + ⋯

Since the power-series coefficients differ, the generating functions cannot be equivalent.

Candidate 1 states this explicitly in formula form; Candidate 2 conveys the same mapping in words. There is no difference in content or required components. Hence they are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives an additive, piece-wise formula (2 + … or 3 + …) while Candidate 2 gives a multiplicative product 3^{ℓ}·4^{s-ℓ}·2^{min(e₀,1)}. These two forms cannot coincide for all choices of the exponents; they differ both structurally and numerically (e.g., take ℓ=1, s=1, e₁=1, e₀=0: Candidate 1 gives 2+1=3, whereas Candidate 2 gives 3¹·4⁰·2⁰=3). Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives a piece-wise formula that depends on every exponent \(e_j\) (for \(j\ge 1\)) as well as on \(e_0\).

Candidate 2 gives a single formula \(3+s-\ell+e_0\) that depends only on the number of prime factors \(s\) and \(e_0\); it ignores all other exponents \(e_j\).

Because the two expressions are clearly different and coincide only in very special cases, they are not equivalent.
Both candidates give the same mathematical expression, because  

  binom{m}{2} = m(m−1)/2,  

so 2^{\binom{m}{2}} = 2^{m(m−1)/2}.  
Hence

 1 / (2^{\binom{m}{2}} m!) = 1 / (m!·2^{m(m−1)/2}).

The two proposed formulas have the same “scalar” term  $\binom{n}{j}$, but they differ in the coefficient that multiplies $(u-1)$:

• Candidate 1 coefficient:   $X=\binom{\tfrac{\,n-2\,}{2}}{\tfrac{\,j-1\,}{2}}\;$ (an ordinary integer that can be $0,1,2,\dots$).

• Candidate 2 coefficient:   $Y=(\binom{\,n-1}{\,j-1}\bmod 2)\in\{0,1\}$.

Because $X$ can take values larger than 1 (e.g. $n=6,\;j=3$ gives $X=2$ while $Y=0$), the two expressions do not agree in general in the Grothendieck-Witt ring, where integer coefficients matter. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
The two proposed formulas give different decompositions in 1 + u inside GW(𝔽_q).

• Candidate 2 yields  
 – 1–component: binom(n,j) if j(n–1)/2 is even, otherwise 0;  
 – u–component: binom(n,j) if j(n–1)/2 is odd, otherwise 0.

• Candidate 1 yields  
 – 1–component: binom(n,j) – binom((n–2)/2,(j–1)/2);  
 – u–component: binom((n–2)/2,(j–1)/2).

For generic n and j the extra binomial term is not identically zero, so the two expressions disagree. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are 

Candidate 1:  p_a = (p(p − 1)m)/2 + 1  
Candidate 2:  p_a = m(p − 1) + 1.

For them to be identical for all p and m we would need  

(p(p − 1)m)/2 = m(p − 1)  
⇒ (p(p − 1))/2 = (p − 1)  
⇒ (p − 1)(p − 2) = 0  
⇒ p = 1 or p = 2.

Thus the two formulas coincide only in the special cases p = 1 or p = 2; otherwise they differ. Since the problem does not impose p = 1 or p = 2, the candidates are not generally equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 differ on the value for the cycle graph Cₙ.

• For n ≡ 2 (mod 4):  
 – Candidate 1 gives ⌈(n+1)/2⌉ = ⌈n/2 + 0.5⌉ = ⌈n/2⌉ + 1.  
 – Candidate 2 gives ⌈n/2⌉.

Thus the two answers disagree for all n of the form 4k + 2. Because at least one sub-answer differs, under Rule 2 the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates provide three answers, but they differ in the third one:

1. [T(R), T(R)] – both give 0.  
2. dim_{Z(R)} R – both give 4.  
3. Type of involution – Candidate 1 says “of the first kind,” Candidate 2 says “symplectic.”

“Symplectic” is only one possible subtype of “first kind”; the two terms are not identical. Therefore the third answers disagree. Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 1 says  
• 𝑶_K = ℤ[√d] if d ≢ 1 (mod 4)  
• 𝑶_K = ℤ[(1+√d)/2] if d ≡ 1 (mod 4).

Because d is square-free, it cannot be divisible by 4, so the only possible residue classes are 1, 2, 3 (mod 4).  
Hence “d ≢ 1 (mod 4)” means exactly “d ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4)”.

Candidate 2 states this explicitly:  
• ℤ[√d] when d ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4);  
• ℤ[(1+√d)/2] when d ≡ 1 (mod 4).

Thus the two answers assign the same ring of integers for every admissible square-free d. They are equivalent.
The problem asks for four separate values, one for each of the cases (a)–(d).  

• Candidate 1 supplies a different value for each of the four cases.  
• Candidate 2 supplies only a single value, “4,” with no breakdown by cases.

Because Candidate 2 fails to give answers for cases (a)–(c) and disagrees with Candidate 1 on cases (a)–(c), the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 differ in the value they give for case 2.

• Case 2 conditions: either γ(G)=γ(H)=1 or γ(G)=1 with H≅\overline{K₂}.  
  – Candidate 1 gives 1.  
  – Candidate 2 gives γ(H), which is 1 in the first sub-case but equals 2 in the second sub-case (since γ(H)=2 for two isolated vertices).  

Because the outputs for this case are not the same in general, the two candidates are not equivalent.

• For case 3 (γ(G)=1 and γ(H)>1 with |V(H)|≥3), Candidate 1 gives 2, whereas Candidate 2 gives 2γ(H).

Since the values differ in at least one sub-case, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different sets of relations:

 • ν ϑ = 0  
 • μ² = ν²  

Candidate 2:
 • μ η = 0  
 • ν ϑ = 0  
 • η = ϑ  

Because Candidate 1 relates μ and ν whereas Candidate 2 relates η and ϑ, the resulting quotient rings are not the same (no renaming of variables makes the two ideals coincide). Hence the answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different ideals:

• Candidate 1:  (μη, νϑ, μ² + η² − ν² − η²) = (μη, νϑ, μ² − ν²)

• Candidate 2:  (μη, νϑ)

The extra relation μ² = ν² (or μ² − ν² = 0) present in Candidate 1 is not implied by the relations in Candidate 2. Hence the resulting quotient rings are not the same.

Candidate 1: |H| ≤ C(n−1, k−1) − C(n−k−1, k−1) − C(n−k−2, k−2) + 2  
Candidate 2: |H| ≤ C(n−2, k−2)

To see if they are the same, test one admissible pair, say k = 3, n = 7 (the smallest allowed n).

• Candidate 1:  
 C(6,2) − C(3,2) − C(2,1) + 2 = 15 − 3 − 2 + 2 = 12.  
• Candidate 2:  
 C(5,1) = 5.

Since 12 ≠ 5, the two expressions are not equal; hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: |H| ≤ C(n−1, k−1) − C(n−k−1, k−1) − C(n−k−2, k−2) + 2  
Candidate 2: |H| ≤ C(n−1, k−1) − C(n−k−1, k−1)

They differ by the extra term −C(n−k−2, k−2) + 2.  
The two expressions are equal only when C(n−k−2, k−2) = 2, which (for k ≥ 3) happens only in the special case k = 3, n = 7.  
For all other admissible (n, k), the expressions are different.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 proposes a specific finite list of groups; Candidate 2 merely restates that G can have Fitting length 1, 2, or 3 without giving any explicit group descriptions. Since the two answers do not coincide in content or detail, they are not equivalent. 

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives a finite, explicit list of eleven concrete groups.  
Candidate 2 does not list any particular groups; it merely restates the general possibilities “nilpotent, metanilpotent, or solvable of Fitting length 3,” which is essentially just paraphrasing the hypothesis f(G) ≤ 3.  

Because one candidate supplies a specific finite list while the other gives only a broad descriptive classification, their answers are clearly different and not interchangeable.

The question asks for two distinct generating functions.  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each give two formulas, but the formulas themselves are very different:

For the first generating function  
• Candidate 1:  (q²,q⁴;q⁶)∞ / (q,q,q³,q³,q⁵,q⁵;q⁶)∞  
• Candidate 2:  1 / (q;q)∞²  

These two products cannot be transformed into each other by simple cancellation; a direct comparison (e.g., expanding the first few coefficients) already shows they are unequal.

For the second generating function  
• Candidate 1: 1 / (q²,q³,q³,q⁴;q⁶)∞  
• Candidate 2: (−q;q)∞²  

Again, these are clearly different products.

Since at least one of the required answers differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same expressions for the first three cardinalities, but they disagree on the last two:

• Candidate 1: |AI_{2n-1}(2134)| = M_n − M_{n-2}, |RAI_{2n-1}(1243)| = M_n − M_{n-2}  
• Candidate 2: |AI_{2n-1}(2134)| = M_{n-1}, |RAI_{2n-1}(1243)| = M_{n-1}

Since M_n − M_{n-2} is not generally equal to M_{n-1}, the answers differ. Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 lists five distinct families of eigenvalues, including terms such as  
• 2(λ+μ)/R,  
• 4 μ(λ+μ)/((λ+3μ)R),  
• 2μ(n−1)/R   (n ≥ 2),  
• 2(n+1)μ(λ+μ)/((λ+3μ)R)   (n ≥ 2).

Candidate 2 gives only two parametrised families:  
• 2μ n /R,  
• (λ + 2μ n)/R,  
plus the zero eigenvalue.

The expressions 4 μ(λ+μ)/((λ+3μ)R) and 2(n+1)μ(λ+μ)/((λ+3μ)R) that appear in Candidate 1 never occur in Candidate 2, while Candidate 2 contains eigenvalues λ/R and (λ+2μ n)/R (n ≥ 1) which do not appear in Candidate 1. Hence the two spectra—and their multiplicities—differ.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 evaluates to 0 at z = 0 (its numerator starts with z), so its series expansion begins with 0 + … .  
• Candidate 2 evaluates to 1 at z = 0 (its numerator ∼ 2xz and denominator ∼ 2xz cancel the z), giving constant term 1 + … .

Because the constant terms differ, the generating functions cannot be the same.
The two candidate expressions are not equivalent.

Key observation:
• Candidate 1’s numerator contains a factor z, while its denominator tends to 1 as z → 0, so A₁(0, x) = 0.
• Candidate 2 expands to A₂(0, x) = 1 (the correct limit obtained by L’Hospital/series).

Because the constant terms (and hence the whole generating functions) differ, the two formulas cannot be the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two proposed expressions have very different algebraic natures.

• Candidate 1 is a purely rational function whose numerator and denominator are polynomials of degree ≤ 3 in z.  
• Candidate 2 is an algebraic (non-rational) function, because it contains a square-root term
    √(1 − 2z(1 + x) + z²(1 − x)²).

Since a non-constant square root cannot be cancelled to yield a rational function, the two expressions cannot be the same function of the variables x and z.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 is simply n(n² – 1) ν / (3 μ).

For the two expressions to be equivalent for all n, the coefficients of like powers of n (and the remaining functional dependence on μ and ν) would have to match exactly, which they do not. Therefore, the answers are inequivalent.

The two formulas look similar in overall structure, but differ in a crucial factor that is inside the summation.  

Candidate 1 contains the factor r₍δ₎(d², δ²) in the numerator, whereas Candidate 2 contains r₍δ₎ multiplied explicitly by the gcd (d², δ²).  Unless r₍δ₎(d², δ²) is **defined** to mean r₍δ₎ · (d², δ²) (which is not stated in the problem), the two expressions are not necessarily the same.

Candidate 2: cₙ,ₛ · π · (ξ² + (A/2)²)^{−(n+s+1)/2}

Aside from an extra factor of π in Candidate 2, the powers of A and ξ inside the parentheses differ: 

• Candidate 1 uses A² + 16 ξ².  
• Candidate 2 uses ξ² + A²/4.

These cannot be transformed into one another by any overall constant factor that is independent of A, ξ, n, and s. Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 states:

•  Ω must be (up to measure-zero) a ball centred at some point (x₀, ω₀).  
•  f must be a non-zero constant multiple of a translated-and-modulated Gaussian:  
   f(x)=c e^{2πi x ω₀} φ(x−x₀).

Candidate 2 states:

•  Ω is a ball (modulo a null set).  
•  f is “a Gaussian function”.

The difference lies in the description of f.  Candidate 1 requires the Gaussian to be shifted in time (x₀) and modulated in frequency (ω₀), whereas Candidate 2 just says “Gaussian”, without mentioning any time–frequency shifts.  A plain Gaussian centred at 0 and with no modulation does not, in general, satisfy the equality condition when Ω is centred elsewhere, so the extra conditions in Candidate 1 are essential.  Because Candidate 2 omits them, the two answers supply different necessary-and-sufficient conditions.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 states that

• Ω must be (up to null‐sets) a ball centred at some point (x₀, ω₀), and  
• f must be a non-zero constant times a time-frequency shift of the standard Gaussian, i.e. f(x)=c e^{2πi x ω₀} φ(x−x₀).

Candidate 2 says merely that

• Ω is a ball, and  
• f is a Gaussian function.

Candidate 2 does not mention that the ball may be centred arbitrarily or that the Gaussian may be translated and modulated to match that centre; in the usual interpretation “Gaussian function’’ means something like A e^{−a(x−b)²}, without the extra complex modulation factor. Hence Candidate 2 omits information that Candidate 1 declares necessary. Because the two sets of conditions are not identical, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives a very specific characterization:

• Ω must be (a.e.) a ball whose centre is the point (x0, ω0) that also appears in the description of f.  
• f must be (up to a non-zero constant) the standard fixed-width Gaussian φ translated by x0 and modulated by e^{2πi x ω0}. No dilation of the Gaussian is allowed.

Candidate 2 only says:

• Ω is (a.e.) a ball – it does not tie the centre of the ball to any parameters in f.  
• f is “a Gaussian function’’ – this phrase can include Gaussians of arbitrary width and may or may not include the modulation factor e^{2πi x ω0}.

Thus Candidate 2 omits (or at least does not state) the dependence between the centre of Ω and the translation/modulation of f, and it allows a wider class of Gaussians than Candidate 1 permits. Because the two statements are not identical and Candidate 1 is strictly more specific, the candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 states:

• Ω must (up to measure-zero) be a ball whose centre is some point (x₀, ω₀).  
• f must be a constant multiple of a time–frequency shift of the fixed Gaussian ϕ, namely  
 f(x)=c e^{2πi x ω₀} ϕ(x−x₀).

Candidate 2 simply says:

• Ω is a ball in ℝ².  
• f is a Gaussian function.

Differences:

1. Centre: Candidate 1 requires Ω to be centred at (x₀, ω₀); Candidate 2 does not mention the centre.

2. Relation between f and Ω: Candidate 1 ties the shift/modulation parameters of f exactly to the centre of Ω. Candidate 2 gives no such relation.

3. Modulation: Candidate 1 allows a multiplicative e^{2πi x ω₀} factor; Candidate 2 may be interpreted as excluding such purely oscillatory factors (a “Gaussian function” is usually taken as c e^{−a(x−b)²}, real-valued up to a constant phase, with no extra modulation).

Hence Candidate 2 omits essential conditions that Candidate 1 supplies, and the two answers describe different (non-equivalent) sets of equality cases.

  – Candidate 2’s formula is 2/(s+1)·binom(s−1,(s−1)/2), which is independent of d.  

• When d is odd:  
  – Candidate 1 again has explicit dependence on d inside the summation.  
  – Candidate 2 gives 2^{⌊s/2⌋}, independent of d.

• Candidate 1 (d even) reduces to one term

Comparing with Candidate 1

 Z₁ = n!(2π)^{n/2}(β/2)^{-(βn(n-1)/4+n/2)} Γ(β/2)^{-n} ∏_{j=1}^n Γ(jβ/2),

one sees that

 Z₁ / Z₂ = [(β/2) Γ(β/2)]^{-(n-1)} = Γ(1+β/2)^{-(n-1)} ≠ 1 (in general).

Thus the two expressions differ by the non-trivial factor Γ(1+β/2)^{n-1}, so they are inequivalent.
The two candidates give different normalizing constants.

(1 − 1/k)(n² − s²)/2 + s(s − 1)/2  
= (k−1)/k·(n² − s²)/2 + s(s − 1)/2  
= [(k−1)(n² − s²)+k s(s − 1)]/(2k)  
= [(k−1)n²−(k−1)s²+k s²−k s]/(2k)  
= [(k−1)n²+s²−k s]/(2k).

Candidate 2:
[(k−1)n²−s(k−s)]/(2k)  
= [(k−1)n²−(k s−s²)]/(2k)  
= [(k−1)n²+s²−k s]/(2k).

The numerators and denominators coincide, so the two formulas are identical.

Candidate 1 says  

• Ω is (up to null–set) a ball centred at some point (x₀,ω₀).  
• f is a non-zero constant times a time–frequency shift of the standard Gaussian, i.e.  
  f(x)=c e^{2πi x·ω₀} φ(x−x₀).  

Candidate 2 says  

• Ω must be a ball in ℝ^{2d}.  
• f must be a Gaussian function.  

The word “ball’’ normally allows any centre, so the first condition in Candidate 2 matches that of Candidate 1.  
Likewise, in time-frequency analysis a “Gaussian function’’ ordinarily includes all translates, modulations and scalar multiples of the standard Gaussian, so the second condition coincides with Candidate 1’s more explicit description.

Therefore the two candidates express the same requirements; Candidate 2 is simply less detailed but not contradictory.

The two candidates give different algebraic expressions. Checking a specific integer value (which is legitimate because the formulae are supposed to hold for every integer s ≥ 2) already shows disagreement:

• Take s = 3  
  – Candidate 1:  C₁ = C(2,1) + C(1,1) = 2 + 1 = 3  
  – Candidate 2:  C₂ = C(6,3) − C(6,4) = 20 − 15 = 5  

Since 3 ≠ 5, the expressions cannot be identical for all s. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives  
|CS₍s,s+1₎| = C(s − 1, ⌊(s − 1)/2⌋) + C(s − 2, ⌊(s − 1)/2⌋).

Candidate 2 gives  
|CS₍s,s+1₎| = (1/(s+1)) C(2s, s).

Evaluate both at s = 3:

• Candidate 1: C(2,1) + C(1,1) = 2 + 1 = 3.  
• Candidate 2: (1/4) C(6,3) = (1/4)·20 = 5.

Since they yield different values, the two expressions are not equivalent.

The two expressions are

Candidate 1: p^k + [p^{k+1}(p² – 1)(p^{3k} – 1)] / [2(p³ – 1)]

Candidate 2: (p^{4k} – p^{4k – 2} + 2 p^k)/2.

Re-expressing candidate 2 gives  
(p^{4k} – p^{4k – 2})/2 + p^k.

So both answers can be written as p^k plus an extra term.  Set the extra terms equal and simplify:

p^{k+1}(p^{3k} – 1)(p² – 1)/(2(p³ – 1))  ?=  (p^{4k} – p^{4k – 2})/2.

After cancelling the common factor (p² – 1)/2 one must have  
p^{k+1}(p^{3k} – 1)/(p³ – 1) = p^{4k – 2}.  
This reduces to  
p^{4k+1} – p^{k+1} = p^{4k+1} – p^{4k – 2},  
which forces p^{k+1} = p^{4k – 2}, i.e. k = 1.  

Therefore the two expressions agree only when k = 1 and differ for general k.  Since the problem asks for a formula valid for all p and k, the two candidates are not equivalent.
To see whether the two formulas coincide, compare only the “extra” term past the common \(p^{k}\):

Candidate 1 extra term  
A₁ =  \( \dfrac{p^{k+1}(p^{2}-1)(p^{3k}-1)}{2(p^{3}-1)} \)

Candidate 2 extra term  
A₂ =  \( \dfrac{(p+1)(p^{k}-1)p^{3k-1}}{2} \)

Rewrite A₁:

p^{3}-1 = (p-1)(p^{2}+p+1) and p^{2}-1 = (p-1)(p+1)

A₁ = \(\dfrac{p^{k+1}(p-1)(p+1)(p^{3k}-1)}{2(p-1)(p^{2}+p+1)}
      = \dfrac{(p+1)p^{k+1}(p^{3k}-1)}{2(p^{2}+p+1)}.\)

Thus we need to test

      (p+1)p^{k+1}(p^{3k}-1)/(p^{2}+p+1)
   ?= (p+1)p^{3k-1}(p^{k}-1).

After cancelling the common factor (p+1)/2, the equality would require  

      p^{k+1}(p^{3k}-1) = (p^{2}+p+1)p^{3k-1}(p^{k}-1).

Left-hand side:   \(p^{4k+1} - p^{k+1}\).

Right-hand side:  \(p^{3k-1}(p^{k}-1)(p^{2}+p+1)
                = p^{4k+1}+p^{4k}+p^{4k-1}-p^{3k+1}-p^{3k}-p^{3k-1}.\)

For k=2, the two expressions become  
LHS = \(p^{9}-p^{3}\)  
RHS = \(p^{9}+p^{8}-p^{6}-p^{5}\),  
which are clearly different for any prime p.

Since the extra terms differ (and hence the entire formulas differ) except possibly for some special small k, the two candidates are not algebraically identical for general p and k.

Candidate 1 gives
 p^k + [p^{k+1}(p² – 1)(p^{3k} – 1)] / [2(p³ – 1)].

Candidate 2 gives
 p^k + (p^{4k} – p^{4k – 2}) / 2
  = p^k + (p^{4k – 2}(p² – 1)) / 2.

Rewrite Candidate 1:

(p^{3k} – 1)/(p³ – 1) = Σ_{i=0}^{k–1} p^{3i},
so the extra term becomes
 (p^{k+1}(p² – 1)/2) · Σ_{i=0}^{k–1} p^{3i}.

Thus Candidate 1’s second summand equals
 (p² – 1)/2 · [p^{k+1} + p^{k+4} + … + p^{4k – 2}],
a sum of k different powers of p (for k ≥ 2).

Candidate 2’s extra term is a single power:
 (p² – 1)/2 · p^{4k – 2}.

Except when k = 1 (where both reduce to the same single power), the two expressions differ; for k ≥ 2 Candidate 1 contains additional lower-degree terms absent from Candidate 2.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not clearly giving the same formula.

• In case (i) Candidate 1 writes the sum as  
  ∑_{(A₁,…,A_r)∈𝒫_{r,n}} ∏_{j=1}^r Δ(A_j)²,  
where the product of Vandermonde determinants of the r subsets is taken and each factor is squared.  
Candidate 2 merely writes  
  ∑_{κ∈𝒫_{r,n}} Δ(κ)².  
Because κ is an r-tuple of sets, Δ(κ) is undefined unless one specifies that Δ(κ) means the product of the individual Δ(A_j); this is not stated. Hence Candidate 2’s expression is ambiguous and not demonstrably identical to Candidate 1’s explicit product.

• In case (ii) the same ambiguity exists with Δ(κ)⁴ vs. the explicit Δ(A)⁴ Δ(A′)⁴.

• Candidate 1 also supplies an explicit formula for the constant c_{n,β,r,βs} (with an extra piecewise factor), whereas Candidate 2 leaves the constant unspecified; the two could therefore differ.

Because of these discrepancies in the exact forms given for both required cases, the answers cannot be considered equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 
 F₍c₎(1,q)=(-q²;q²)∞ / (q;q)∞,

whereas Candidate 2 gives 
 F₍c₎(1,q)=1 / (q²;q²)∞.

Using the infinite-product definition (a;q)∞=∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−a qⁿ):

• (-q²;q²)∞=∏_{m=1}^{∞}(1+q^{2m}),  
• (q;q)∞=∏_{m=1}^{∞}(1−q^{m}),  
• (q²;q²)∞=∏_{m=1}^{∞}(1−q^{2m}).

Hence  

Candidate 1 =  ∏_{m≥1}(1+q^{2m}) / ∏_{m≥1}(1−q^{m}),  

Candidate 2 =  1 / ∏_{m≥1}(1−q^{2m}).

These two products are not the same; even a numerical check (e.g. q=0.1) gives ≈1.137 for Candidate 1 and ≈1.010 for Candidate 2. Therefore the two answers are inequivalent.

Candidate 1: F₁(q) = (-q²; q²)₍∞₎ / (q; q)₍∞₎  

Candidate 2: F₂(q) = 1 / [(q; q)₍∞₎ · (q²; q²)₍∞₎]

To see whether F₁(q) = F₂(q), compare the extra factors beyond (q; q)₍∞₎:

F₁/F₂ = (-q²; q²)₍∞₎ · (q²; q²)₍∞₎
       = ∏_{n≥0} (1 + q^{2n+2})(1 − q^{2n+2})
       = ∏_{n≥0} (1 − q^{4n+4})
       = (q⁴; q⁴)₍∞₎ ≠ 1 (for generic q).

Because the ratio is (q⁴; q⁴)₍∞₎ rather than 1, the two expressions are different. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two expressions are different infinite-product formulas.

1.  Candidate 1  
   F₁(q) = (-q²; q²)∞ / (q; q)∞  
   = ∏_{n≥0}(1 + q^{2n+2}) / ∏_{n≥1}(1 – q^{n})

2.  Candidate 2  
   F₂(q) = 1 / [(q; q³)∞ · (q³; q³)∞]  
   = 1 / [∏_{n≥0}(1 – q^{3n+1}) · ∏_{n≥0}(1 – q^{3n+3})]

If we rewrite (q; q³)∞ · (q³; q³)∞, it equals (q; q)∞ / (q²; q³)∞.  Hence the ratio of the two candidates is

   F₁ / F₂ = (-q²; q²)∞ / (q²; q³)∞ .

The factor (-q²; q²)∞ is ∏(1 + q^{even}), whereas (q²; q³)∞ is ∏(1 – q^{3n+2}); these products are clearly not identical (e.g., at q = 0.1 they evaluate to ≈ 1.0101 and ≈ 0.99, respectively).  Therefore F₁ ≠ F₂.

Consequently, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas in nearly every case.

1. For k = 1  
   • Candidate 1 gives σ₁.  
   • Candidate 2 gives σ_{m-1}.  
   These are the same only when m = 2; in general they differ.

2. For 1 < k < m  
   • Candidate 1 uses max{ σ₁ − λ , σ_k , λ − σ_{k−1} }.  
   • Candidate 2 uses max{ σ_{m−k} , | λ − σ_{m−k+1} | }.  
   The indexings and the terms inside the maxima do not match.

3. For k = m  
   • Candidate 1: max{ σ₁ − λ , λ − σ_{m−1} }.  
   • Candidate 2: max{ λ − σ₁ , σ_{m−1} − λ }.  
   Here the two inner expressions are negations of each other; they coincide only when both are symmetric around zero (i.e., λ = σ₁ = σ_{m−1}), not in general.

4. For k > m  
   • Candidate 1: max{ σ₁ − λ , λ }.  
   • Candidate 2: max{ λ , σ_{m−1} − λ }.  
   Again the two maxima differ by replacing σ₁ − λ with σ_{m−1} − λ.

The second candidate explicitly uses the natural logarithm “ln 2,” giving the numeric value 1 / 0.693147… ≈ 1.44270.

The first candidate writes “1 / log 2.”  The base of “log” is not specified; in mathematics it can denote base 10, base e, or some other base, depending on convention.  Because the base is ambiguous, “1 / log 2” is not necessarily the same numerical value as “1 / ln 2.”  Only if one assumes (without explicit statement) that “log” means the natural logarithm would they coincide; otherwise they differ (for example, in base 10, 1 / log₁₀2 ≈ 3.322).

Since the two expressions are not unambiguously the same number, the answers are not guaranteed to be equivalent.

The two formulas are not the same.

• Candidate 1 (index i = 0,…,n−1) has, inside each product term,
  Γ(a+ic) Γ(b+ic) Γ(1+(i+1)c) / [Γ(a+b+(n+i−1)c) Γ(1+c)].

• Candidate 2 (index j = 1,…,n) has, inside each product term,
  Γ(a+(j−1)c) Γ(b+(j−1)c) Γ(1+c) / [Γ(a+b+(n+j−2)c) Γ(1+jc)].

Relabelling j = i+1 and comparing term-by-term gives the ratio

 Term₁ / Term₂ = [Γ(1+(i+1)c)/Γ(1+c)]².

Thus the overall ratio of the two products is
 ∏_{k=1}^{n} [Γ(1+kc)/Γ(1+c)]²,

which is generally not 1 for arbitrary c and n. Therefore the two candidate expressions for Sₙ(a,b,c) are inequivalent.

The two formulas differ in how the factors  
Γ(1 + jc) (j = 1,…, n) and Γ(1 + c)ⁿ are placed between numerator and denominator.

Ratio (Candidate 1)/(Candidate 2)

Except for the special case c=0 (where all those Γ-factors equal 1), this ratio is not 1, so the expressions are generally different.

Let s = (–1)^{n/d}.  
Then the bracket in Candidate 1 is  X – sY, while in Candidate 2 it is X + sY.  
These two quantities are identical only if sY = 0, i.e. if A = 0 or B = 0, which is not assumed in the problem; otherwise they differ by a sign that cannot be removed by the power d in general. Hence the two formulas are not the same for generic n, m, A, B.

• Candidate 2 exponent: (1 – ⟨z,z₀⟩)^{–n/p}

Since 2n/p ≠ n/p (for n≠0), the two functions are not the same.  
Because the question asks for both the interpolant and its norm, and the two candidates give different interpolants, their answers are not equivalent.

The question requires two separate expressions.  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both supply two formulas, but:

Take n = 1 as a test:

• Candidate 1:  𝓛(Q₁) = 2·1(μ + ν + 2) = 2(μ + ν + 2)

• Candidate 2:  𝓛(Q₁) = (μ + ν) – (μ – ν) = 2ν

These are equal only if μ + 2 = 0, which is not generally true. Hence the two sets of formulas cannot be the same for arbitrary μ, ν, n.

  sgn ( Pf_I(A) ) = (–1)^{ ∑_{i∈I} i – (|I|+1 choose 2) }.

• Candidate 2 says the sign is the parity of the permutation needed to reorder whatever ordering of the elements of I is given into increasing order.  That sign can vary with the initial ordering of I, whereas Candidate 1’s formula is independent of any ordering.

Thus the two descriptions are not the same in general, so the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: exponent = 15−10 = 5 (odd) → sign = −1.  

Candidate 2: the elements of I are already in increasing order, so the “permutation required to order the elements of I increasingly” is the identity, whose sign is +1.

• Candidate 2 has no such denominator and is a much shorter closed‐form expression.

Because of these large structural differences the two formulas cannot agree for general m (they would scale differently with m even before evaluating the sums). Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two formulas are plainly different in structure, scaling, and numerical size.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.

Reason:  
• Candidate 1 specifies that the ball Ω must be centred at the same phase-space point (x₀, ω₀) that appears in the modulation/translation of the Gaussian, i.e. the parameters of f and the centre of Ω are tied together.  
• Candidate 2 merely says “f is a Gaussian” and “Ω is a ball”, without imposing any relation between the centre of the ball and the parameters of f. Consequently, Candidate 2 would regard as admissible many pairs (f, Ω) for which equality actually fails, whereas Candidate 1 does not.

Because Candidate 2’s statement is strictly weaker (it omits a necessary alignment condition) the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates are NOT equivalent.  
Candidate 1 specifies that Ω must be a ball centered at the same point (x₀, ω₀) that appears in the translation/modulation of the Gaussian, i.e. it describes a precise linkage between Ω and f (up to a non-zero constant).  
Candidate 2 merely says “f is a Gaussian function and Ω is a ball in ℝ²,” without stating that the ball must be centered at the point corresponding to the shift/modulation of the Gaussian or even mentioning those shifts at all. Hence Candidate 2 omits essential details that Candidate 1 includes.
The question asks for the exact (necessary and sufficient) characterization of all pairs  
(Ω , f) that give equality.

• Candidate 1 lists:  
  – Ω must be (a.e.) a ball centred at some point (x₀, ω₀);  
  – f must be exactly a time-frequency shift (modulation by e^{2πixω₀} and translation by x₀) of the fixed Gaussian φ already defined in the statement (up to a non-zero constant).

• Candidate 2 merely states:  
  – Ω is (a.e.) a ball;  
  – f is “a Gaussian function.”

“Gaussian function” is not specified: it could mean any scaled, translated, or modulated Gaussian. In particular,
– Candidate 2 does not insist that the centre of the ball coincide with the shift of the Gaussian;  
– it allows dilated Gaussians, which Candidate 1 (and the classical sharp form of this inequality) excludes.

Because Candidate 2 accepts a strictly larger (or at least not explicitly restricted) class of functions and does not impose the matching-centre condition that Candidate 1 requires, the two answers are not logically identical.

Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different closed-form expressions.

The two expressions

Candidate 1: G(x) = (x⁵ − x³ + x)/(1 − 2x² − x⁶)  
Candidate 2: G(x) = x/(1 − x²)

are not algebraically identical.  
(For instance, cross-multiplying and simplifying yields a residual term 2x⁵, so the two sides differ.)

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1:  (x⁵ – x³ + x)/(1 – 2x² – x⁶)

Candidate 2:  x/(1 – x² – x⁴)

To see whether they are the same rational function, take the ratio of Candidate 1 to Candidate 2:

[(x⁵ – x³ + x)/(1 – 2x² – x⁶)] ÷ [x/(1 – x² – x⁴)]
  =  (x⁵ – x³ + x)(1 – x² – x⁴) / [x(1 – 2x² – x⁶)]
  =  (x⁴ – x² + 1)(1 – x² – x⁴)/(1 – 2x² – x⁶).

Compute (x⁴ – x² + 1)(1 – x² – x⁴):

Let U = x². Then this product is
(U² – U + 1)(1 – U – U²) = 1 – 2U + U² – U⁴
= 1 – 2x² + x⁴ – x⁸.

Thus the ratio becomes
(1 – 2x² + x⁴ – x⁸)/(1 – 2x² – x⁶).

These two polynomials (numerator and denominator) are not constant multiples of each other (they contain different powers and coefficients), so the overall ratio is not identically 1 (nor any non-zero constant). Therefore the two rational functions are different.

Hence the two candidate answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates propose different rational functions:

Candidate 1: (x⁵ − x³ + x)/(1 − 2x² − x⁶)  
Candidate 2: x/(1 − 2x²)

Expanding each into a power series shows they differ already at the x³-coefficient (Candidate 1 gives 1 whereas Candidate 2 gives 2). Hence the two expressions are not the same function.

These two expressions are not the same formula and are not obviously transformable into one another; indeed, even the factor needed to convert the argument change into an integer count differs (candidate 2 would generally give a half-integer if the change of argument is π).

But
(u³; q³)∞ = ∏_{n≥0}(1 – u³q^{3n}),  
(–u³; q³)∞ = ∏_{n≥0}(1 + u³q^{3n}),  
(u²; q)∞ = ∏_{n≥0}(1 – u²q^{n}).

Already for n = 0, the factor comparison gives

The two candidates give completely different closed-form formulas for both \(S_D\) and \(S_P\).

• Candidate 1 uses one $q$-Pochhammer factor whose base (ratio) is \(\varepsilon q^{\,r+t+s}\).

• Candidate 2 uses products of Pochhammer symbols whose base is \(1\) (so each factor is simply a power of a single linear term), and the parameters inside the factors differ from those in Candidate 1.

Since the functional forms, factors and bases of the Pochhammer symbols do not match, the two candidates cannot be equivalent.

Because (−1)^{N+1} = (−1)^{N−1} (the exponents differ by 2 and (−1)^2 = 1), the two inner expressions are identical. Both candidates also have the identical overall prefactor (−1)^{N(N−1)/2}. Therefore the two formulas coincide.

Both candidates give the same formula for the number of rows:

For the number of columns, rewrite each:

n_k = 2^k n_0 (1 + (k m_0)/(2 n_0))
     = 2^k (n_0 + k m_0/2).

Candidate 2:
n_k = (2 n_0 + k m_0) · 2^{k-1}
     = 2^{k-1} · 2 (n_0 + k m_0/2)
     = 2^k (n_0 + k m_0/2).

Candidate 2: nₖ = (2 n₀ + k m₀)·2^{k-1}

Both candidates give the same numerical expressions for the shifted eigenvalues ( 2 n₁ + n₂ – λᵢ and n₁ + 2 n₂ – μⱼ, plus 0 and n₁ + n₂ ), but they assign different multiplicities to those eigenvalues:

• Candidate 1 fixes the multiplicity of every shifted λᵢ (i=2,…,n₁) and every shifted μⱼ (j=2,…,n₂) to 1.  
• Candidate 2 keeps the multiplicity equal to the original multiplicity of λᵢ or μⱼ in G₁ or G₂.

Since multiplicities are part of the spectrum and the two answers disagree on them, the candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same list of numerical expressions for the eigenvalues:

• n₁+n₂ (mult. 1)  
• 2n₁+n₂−λᵢ for i=2,…,n₁  
• n₁+2n₂−μⱼ for j=2,…,n₂  

The only apparent difference is wording about multiplicities.  
– Candidate 1 says each expression produced for a particular index i (or j) has multiplicity 1.  
– Candidate 2 says each expression inherits the multiplicity of the corresponding Laplacian eigenvalue λᵢ (or μⱼ).

Because Candidate 1 lists an eigenvalue once for every index i (or j), any repeated Laplacian eigenvalues automatically appear the same number of times; hence the overall multiplicity coincides with that described by Candidate 2. Thus the two descriptions are mathematically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates list the same numerical expressions for the transformed eigenvalues ( 2n₁+n₂−λᵢ and 2n₂+n₁−μⱼ, plus 0 and n₁+n₂ ).

• Candidate 1: multiplicity 1 for every transformed λᵢ and μⱼ (i = 2…n₁, j = 2…n₂).  
• Candidate 2: multiplicity equal to the multiplicity of λᵢ (or μⱼ) in the original graphs.

Because the multiplicities do not match (except in the special case where every λᵢ and μⱼ is simple), the two spectra are generally different, so the answers are not equivalent.

For n larger than a few units (e.g., n = 8), Candidate 1 gives 4, while Candidate 2 gives n/2 = 4 for n = 8, but for n = 12 Candidate 1 still gives 4 whereas Candidate 2 gives 6, and so on. The formulas are clearly not the same over all n ≥ 4.

• Candidate 2:  t

As functions of the parameters (even s, odd t, coprime), these are not the same in general (they coincide only by accident for some very small pairs such as (s,t) = (2,1)). Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives  
 |CS₍s,t₎| = C((s–2)/2 + (t–1)/2 , (s–2)/2) + C((s–2)/2 + (t–3)/2 , (s–2)/2).

Candidate 2 gives  
 |CS₍s,t₎| = ((s–1)(t–1)) / 2.

For s = 2 (even) and t = 3 (odd, coprime with s) we get  
 Candidate 1: C(1,0) + C(0,0) = 1 + 1 = 2,  
 Candidate 2: ((2–1)(3–1))/2 = 1·2/2 = 1.

The two expressions yield different numerical values, so they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives an alternating sum with many minus signs, while Candidate 2 is a straightforward positive sum of all ℓ(u_i) and all ℓ(v_j) (except v_r).

• Candidate 2 simply states “variance P” and “variance N” for the Gaussian distributions, with no mention of dimension or of dividing the power by n. In an n–dimensional setting this would correspond to ΣX = P Iₙ and ΣZ = N Iₙ, whose traces are nP and nN—different from Candidate 1.

Because the covariance (and hence the power allocation across coordinates) differs unless n = 1, the two candidates are not equivalent under the general formulation of the problem.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 specifies zero-mean Gaussian distributions whose covariance matrices are (P / n) I and (N / n) I, i.e. each component has variance P / n and N / n respectively.  
Candidate 2 specifies zero-mean Gaussian distributions with variances P and N (no division by n).

Unless n = 1 (which is not stated), these two prescriptions differ; they are therefore not equivalent under the given information.

Candidate 1 gives N(m + n, n) = 1/(m + n) · C(m + n, n) · C(m + n, n – 1).

Candidate 2 gives N(m + n, m).

For Narayana numbers N(N,K) we have the symmetry N(N,K) = N(N, N – K + 1); hence

N(m + n, n) = N(m + n, (m + n) – n + 1) = N(m + n, m + 1),

not N(m + n, m) in general. Except in special degenerate cases, these two expressions differ (e.g., for m = 2, n = 3 they give 20 vs 10).

Thus the two candidates are not equivalent.

Already for m = 1 we get

• Candidate 1 → h·1·(q − 1)^2  
• Candidate 2 → h·(q − 1)

These differ by a factor of (q − 1), and for general m the two formulas clearly are not the same product. Thus the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give two required items (interpolant and its norm), so we compare each item.

Interpolant exponents:
• Candidate 1: exponent = 2(n+1)/p  
• Candidate 2: exponent = (n+1)/(p-1)

These two expressions are equal only when p = 2; for a general 1 < p < ∞ they differ (since 2/p ≠ 1/(p-1) in general). Hence the interpolant formulas are not the same.

Because one of the required components differs, the two overall answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give answers for the two required cases (endpoint vertex and interior vertex), so they are directly comparable.  

For each case Candidate 1’s value is divided by the factor (2m − 1), while Candidate 2’s value has no such denominator:

• Endpoint case:  
 Candidate 1: H_{m−1}/(2m−1)  
 Candidate 2: H_{m−1}

• Interior case:  
 Candidate 1: (H_{j−1}+H_{m−j})/(2m−1)  
 Candidate 2: H_{j−1}+H_{m−j}

Because of this extra factor (2m−1), the two candidates’ expressions are not the same in either case. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different formulas.

Although the first term n(m − 1) is the same in both, the second term differs:

• Candidate 2 has + m C_{cc}(H)

Since m ≥ 2 for a non-trivial graph, these expressions are not generally equal. Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for TWO specific things:

1. An explicit expression for the vector  
   v^{(1)} = (γI ⊖ A)^{adj}_{:,1}.
2. The eigen-relation it satisfies with respect to A.

Candidate 2 merely repeats the definition (“first column of the adjugate …”), while Candidate 1 converts that definition into the formula  
   v^{(1)} = γ^{n-1}(γ^{-1}A)^*_{:,1}.  
These two expressions are not obviously the same; indeed, in max-plus algebra the Kleene star (•)^* is not generally equal to the adjugate of (γI ⊖ A). Hence the two candidates give different formulas for v^{(1)}.

Both candidates state an eigen-property (A v = γ v), so that part matches, but because the required first part (the explicit expression) differs, the overall answers are not identical (Rule 2 and Rule 8).

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single explicit formula for the same requested quantity (“the number of times that outcome i appears on level j”).  

Candidate 1: ⌊2ʲ pᵢ⌋ − 2 ⌊2^{j−1} pᵢ⌋  
Candidate 2: ⌊2ʲ pᵢ⌋ (mod 2)

For any real number t, we have the identity  
⌊2t⌋ = 2 ⌊t⌋ + (⌊2 frac(t)⌋), where frac(t)=t−⌊t⌋ and ⌊2 frac(t)⌋ ∈ {0,1}.  
Hence ⌊2t⌋ − 2 ⌊t⌋ = ⌊2 frac(t)⌋, which is exactly ⌊2t⌋ mod 2.

Taking t = 2^{j−1} pᵢ, the two expressions become identical:  
⌊2ʲ pᵢ⌋ − 2 ⌊2^{j−1} pᵢ⌋ = ⌊2ʲ pᵢ⌋ mod 2.

Thus the two candidates are mathematically equivalent and yield the same (0 or 1) count for every i and j.

Both candidates give formulas for the same quantity.

Let a = ⌊2^j p_i⌋ and b = ⌊2^{j-1} p_i⌋.  
We know ⌊2x⌋ is either 2⌊x⌋ or 2⌊x⌋+1, so

a = 2b  or  a = 2b + 1.

Thus a − 2b is 0 when a = 2b and 1 when a = 2b+1.  
But that is exactly a mod 2.

Therefore

⌊2^j p_i⌋ − 2⌊2^{j-1} p_i⌋ = ⌊2^j p_i⌋ mod 2.

The two candidates are mathematically identical, so their answers are equivalent.

These formulas are plainly not the same for any general d. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

The question explicitly asks for the answer “in terms of the signature of S.”  

• Candidate 1 writes ½ · signature(S), using exactly that terminology.  
• Candidate 2 writes sign(S)/2.  The term “sign(S)” is ambiguous: in common mathematical usage it often means only ±1 (the sign of a real number or of det S), not the full difference (# positive − # negative) that “signature” denotes. Because the two symbols can represent different quantities for the same matrix, the two proposed formulas are not guaranteed to coincide.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same formula up to notation:

• Candidate 1:  μ_CZ(A) = ½ · signature(S)  
• Candidate 2:  μ_CZ(A) = ½ · sign(S)

In the symplectic / quadratic-form literature, “sign S” is routinely used as shorthand for the signature of the symmetric matrix S (the difference between the numbers of positive and negative eigenvalues). Thus “sign(S)” and “signature(S)” denote the same integer. Apart from this notational variation, the two formulas are identical. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The two formulas are structurally different.

• Candidate 2 has one φ–factor for every edge of the spanning tree (|T| = n – 1 factors, always with i = 1).

Because the number and kinds of factors in the two products differ, the two expressions cannot be algebraically identical. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 multiplies only φ₁(p^{k−a_e}) once for each edge e in the spanning tree T.

Whenever a linked cell has size ≥ 2, Candidate 1 contains factors such as φ₂, φ₃, … that never appear in Candidate 2. For example, for a cell of size 2 the two expressions contain respectively

 Candidate 1: φ₁ · φ₂ = (p−1)(p−2)p^{2(j−1)},  
 Candidate 2: φ₁²  = (p−1)² p^{2(j−1)},

We must compare the two sets of answers for S₁(u,q) and S₂(u,q).

Candidate 2:  
S₁ = (u; q²)∞ / (u; q)∞, S₂ = 1 / (u; q²)∞.

For each of S₁ and S₂ the expressions differ (they are not simple algebraic rearrangements of one another), so the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem asks for the answers in terms of the infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbols 
\[

\]

Candidate 1 gives
• $S_1(u,q)=(u;q^2)_\infty$  
• $S_2(u,q)=(u;q)_\infty$,

explicitly using the required infinite products.

Candidate 2 states
• $S_1(u,q)=(u;q^2)_n$  
• $S_2(u,q)=(u;q)_n$,

where the subscript is “$n$,” not “$\infty$.”  In ordinary $q$-product notation, $(a;q)_n$ (finite product) and $(a;q)_\infty$ (infinite product) are different unless $n$ is explicitly taken to be $\infty$, which Candidate 2 does not specify.  Therefore the two sets of results are not the same.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The second candidate gives an explicit formula, (1/(n+1)) · C(2n,n), i.e. the n-th Catalan number.  
The first candidate only says the common value equals Mₙ; unless the problem already defined Mₙ to be exactly that Catalan number (something we cannot assume), the two expressions are not guaranteed to coincide. Therefore, the two answers are not necessarily the same.
The first candidate merely states that the common value is “\(M_n\)” without defining what \(M_n\) is, while the second candidate gives an explicit numerical formula \(\displaystyle\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}\).  
Because \(M_n\) is undefined/ambiguous in Candidate 1, we cannot assume it equals the Catalan number (the formula given by Candidate 2). Hence the two answers are not provably the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different explicit expressions for the common value:

• Candidate 1: “\(M_n\)”

The two candidates give different closed-form expressions:

• Candidate 1:  C(2n − 2 − k, k)

• Candidate 2:  (1/n) C(n, k) C(n, k + 1)

Testing a specific case (n = 4, k = 1):

 Candidate 1 → C(5, 1) = 5  
 Candidate 2 → (1/4)·C(4, 1)·C(4, 2) = (1/4)·4·6 = 6

Since 5 ≠ 6, the two formulas are not identical. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different explicit formulas:  

Candidate 1:  C₁(n,k) = 𝑪(2n−2−k, k)  

Candidate 2:  C₂(n,k) = (1/n) · 𝑪(n, k) · 𝑪(n, k+1)

To see whether they coincide for all n ≥ 2 and admissible k, test small cases:

n = 4, k = 1  
C₁ = 𝑪(5,1) = 5  
C₂ = (1/4) · 𝑪(4,1) · 𝑪(4,2) = (1/4) · 4 · 6 = 6

Since 5 ≠ 6, the two formulas are not equal in general.  
Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives the number  
C₁(n,k) =  (2 n – 2 – k choose k).

Candidate 2 gives  
C₂(n,k) = (1/n)·(n choose k)·(n choose k+1).

Test them for n = 4, k = 1:

• C₁(4,1) = (6 – 1 choose 1) = (5 choose 1) = 5.  
• C₂(4,1) = (1/4)·(4 choose 1)·(4 choose 2)

Since 5 ≠ 6, the two formulas do not agree in general. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same expression for mₖ (mₖ = m₀ qᵏ), but their expressions for nₖ differ:

• Candidate 2: nₖ = n₀ (q−1)ᵏ + m₀ (qᵏ − (q−1)ᵏ) = m₀ qᵏ + (q−1)ᵏ (n₀ − m₀)

These expressions are generally not equal (e.g., for k = 1 they give q n₀ + m₀ vs. (q−1) n₀ + m₀).

Candidate 1 supplies two separate limits, one for the general (non-symmetric) matrices Aₙ and one for the symmetric matrices Bₙ.  
Candidate 2 gives a single formula only:
 (1/|Aut G|) ∏_{k≥1}(1–p^{-(2k–1)}).

Therefore:

1. Candidate 2 omits the limit for the first model (cok Aₙ), violating Rule 2 (the question requires two limits).
2. Even for the second model, Candidate 2’s expression is missing the extra factor  
 (# of perfect symmetric bilinear forms)/( |G|·|Aut G| )  
that appears in Candidate 1, so the two answers do not match.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates agree on the first limit (for the nonsymmetric matrices), but they give different prefactors for the second limit (for the symmetric matrices):

• Candidate 1 uses  
  (# perfect symmetric bilinear forms on G)/( |G| |Aut(G)| ).

• Candidate 2 uses  
  1/( |Aut(G)| |G|^{1/2} ).

These are equal only in very special cases (e.g., |G|=1). In general # {perfect symmetric bilinear forms on G} ≠ |G|^{1/2}.  
Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives

These collections are clearly not the same: candidate 2 contains groups not in candidate 1 (e.g., C₂, D₃, D₅, infinitely many others) and candidate 1 contains groups of even index 2n that candidate 2 may or may not include, but overall the lists do not match.

The two candidate expressions are not equivalent.

Reasoning:  
• Candidate 1, (−√2;q)∞, expands to the infinite product ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1+√2 q^{n}), whose constant (q⁰) term equals 1+√2.  
• Candidate 2, (2 q²;q²)∞ / (√2 q;q)∞, has constant term 1, because the numerator’s first non-trivial factor starts at q² and the denominator likewise has no q⁰ factor.

Since the constant terms of the two q-series differ, the two expressions cannot be identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates are single expressions meant to represent the same generating function, so we compare them as formal power series.

Recall (a;q)_∞ = ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 - a q^{n}).

Candidate 1: (−√2; q)_∞  
 = ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 + √2 q^{n}).  
The constant (q⁰) term is 1 + √2.

Candidate 2: (−q; q²)_∞ / (q; q²)_∞  
 = ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 + q^{2n+1}) / ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 − q^{2n+1})  
 = ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 + q^{2n+1}) (1 − q^{2n+1})^{−1}.  
The factor for n=0 is (1+q)/(1−q) = 1 + 2q + …, so the constant term of the whole product is 1.

Because the constant terms already differ (1 + √2 versus 1), the two series cannot be identical. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 writes the usual result “\(\{-2\}^{m-n}\),” i.e. the eigenvalue \(-2\) with multiplicity \(m-n\).

• Candidate 1 writes “\(-2^{m-n}\),” which denotes the single number \((-2)^{m-n}\) rather than the value \(-2\) repeated \(m-n\) times. Thus multiplicity (and, except when \(m-n=1\), even the numerical value) is different.

These are not the same value (except in the trivial case p_e(n)=0, which is not generally true for all n ≥ 1). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

• Candidate 1: 2 p_e(n)  
• Candidate 2: (–1)^n p_e(n)

Since (–1)^n equals +1 for even n and –1 for odd n, the factor in Candidate 2 alternates between +1 and –1, whereas Candidate 1 always multiplies by 2. These two expressions coincide only in the trivial case p_e(n)=0 (if that ever occurs), but in general they are different. Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different probability values.  
For example, when k = 1 and d = 0:

• Candidate 1: P = 1/q  
• Candidate 2: P = (q − 1)/q ≠ 1/q  (for any q > 1)

Since they do not match (and other cases also differ), the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s answer is “n+1,” while Candidate 2’s answer is the fixed number “1.”  
These are different expressions/numbers, so the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give exactly the same mathematical expression:
( q^{1/2} ; q )_∞² / ( q ; q )_∞.

Hence they are equivalent.

The two candidates give different answers:

• Candidate 1: d + 2  
• Candidate 2: 1  

These are plainly unequal for general integer d (except possibly in the special case d = –1, which is not implied by the question). Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not the same.  

Candidate 1 still contains an incomplete Beta‐function–type integral that depends on |y| (upper limit 1 − |y|²), whereas Candidate 2 has already replaced that integral with the complete Beta function, producing a constant independent of y (apart from the explicit factor |y|^{α−d}).  
Since the extra |y|-dependent factor present in Candidate 1 is missing in Candidate 2, the formulas differ.

Candidate 2 simply appends the (appropriate) unit “IDR / USD,” while Candidate 1 omits the unit. Given the context of an exchange-rate question—where the unit is implicitly IDR per USD—this omission does not create meaningful ambiguity, and the figures match to at least six significant digits.

The numerical value of  

log₂(52! / (26!·26!)) ≈ 48.8171  (to six significant digits).

Candidate 1 gives 48.8 → 48.8000 to six significant digits.

Since 48.8000 ≠ 48.8171 at six-significant-digit precision, the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical value “48.8”.  
Candidate 2 gives the exact expression “log₂ (52 choose 26)”.

Evaluating log₂ (52 choose 26) more precisely yields about 48.817 bits, which differs from 48.800 by more than the 6-significant-digit tolerance required by Rule 4. Hence the answers are different.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give:

Candidate 1: 48.8 (which is 48.8000 to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: log₂(52!/(26!)²) ≈ 48.8289 (to 6 significant digits)

Since 48.8000 ≠ 48.8289 when compared to six significant digits, the answers are not the same.

The two candidates give the same numerical value:  

3.54 × 10⁻⁷ (Candidate 1)  
3.54 × 10⁻⁷ C (Candidate 2).

The only difference is that Candidate 2 explicitly writes the unit “C”.  
Because the question is “What is the net charge …?”, the natural (and essentially only) standard unit is the coulomb, so Candidate 1’s omission of the unit does not create real ambiguity; the value itself strongly implies coulombs.  

Therefore the predictions are effectively identical.

The question asks for a “rate of return,” which can reasonably be expressed either as a pure number in decimal form (e.g., 0.1092) or as a percentage (e.g., 10.92 %).  
Candidate 2 explicitly gives “10.92%,” clearly indicating a percentage.  
Candidate 1 gives “10.92” with no unit. Because both a plain number and a percentage are plausible units for a rate of return, omitting the percent sign introduces ambiguity (10.92 could mean 10.92 % or 1092 %).  

Under Rule 1, when the omission of a unit leads to possible ambiguity, the answers are treated as inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question expresses all rates explicitly with the “%” symbol, so both a percentage form (10.92 %) and a pure number form (10.92) are possible interpretations.  
Because Candidate 1 omits the “%” sign, the value 10.92 could mean either 10.92 % or 1092 % (when read as a decimal). This ambiguity means the two answers are not guaranteed to represent the same quantity.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a “rate of return,” which can reasonably be expressed either as a percentage (e.g., 10.92 %) or as a decimal fraction (e.g., 0.1092).  

• Candidate 1 gives “10.92” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “10.92%,” explicitly a percentage.

Because Candidate 1 omits the unit, there is ambiguity: 10.92 could mean 10.92 % or 10.92 (i.e., 1092 %), and both interpretations are plausible given the absence of a unit. Under Rule 1, if omission of a unit introduces such ambiguity when multiple units are reasonable, the answers are considered inequivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 1.28 × 10⁻⁶.  
Candidate 2 explicitly appends the unit “V/K,” while Candidate 1 omits it.  
Because the question specifically asks for the thermoelectric power “in V/K,” the omitted unit in Candidate 1 does not create ambiguity—the only sensible unit here is V/K. Hence the two responses represent the same quantity.

The two candidates present different results.

• Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 1.581, which (expressed to six significant digits) is 1.58100.

 e / (e − 1) ≈ 1.58198 (to six significant digits).

Comparing 1.58100 and 1.58198 at six significant digits shows a discrepancy, so the answers are not equivalent.

Evaluating the expression numerically:
1/e ≈ 0.367879  
(√π/2) erf(1) ≈ 0.746824

⇒ Candidate 2 ≈ −0.378944693  → to 6 significant digits: −0.378945

Comparing −0.378900 and −0.378945, the values differ at the 5-th significant digit, so they are not equal to 6 significant digits as required by Rule 4. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The numeric value of Candidate 2 is  
1/e – (√π / 2) erf(1) ≈ –0.378945 …

Candidate 1 gives –0.3789, which to six significant digits is –0.378900.

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:

Candidate 1: 0.378900  
Candidate 2: 0.378945  

They differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits, so according to Rule 4 the answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for a single numerical derivative value at x = 0, so each candidate supplies one number.

Candidate 1: 0.3017  
Candidate 2: 2 e² / (1 + e⁴)

Numerically,
e ≈ 2.718281828  
e² ≈ 7.389056  
e⁴ ≈ 54.598150  
So candidate 2 ≈ 2·7.389056 / 55.598150 ≈ 14.778112 / 55.598150 ≈ 0.2658 (to 6 significant digits: 0.265800).

Comparing the two values to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
0.301700 vs 0.265800 → they differ.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two answers give numerical values for the electron speed in the same unit (m/s).  
• Candidate 1: 90 000 000 m/s = 9.00000 × 10⁷ m/s  
• Candidate 2: 9.38 × 10⁷ m/s  

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

9.00000 × 10⁷ ≠ 9.38000 × 10⁷  

Since the numbers differ, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for the work \(w\), whose unit should be an energy unit (e.g., J, kJ, or perhaps L·atm).  

• Candidate 1 gives just “0” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “0 J”.

Because multiple reasonable units could be used and Candidate 1 omits the unit entirely, Rule 1 states that this omission introduces ambiguity; therefore the two answers are not considered equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value (temperature rise) with units of kelvin.

Candidate 1: +37 K  
Candidate 2: 36.77 K

Both answers use the same unit (kelvin), so no unit conversion is needed. Comparing the numbers to six significant digits:

37 K  → 37.0000  
36.77 K → 36.7700  

Since 37.0000 ≠ 36.7700, the two answers do not match to six significant digits. Therefore, according to Rule 4, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two answers are expressed in different units.  
Convert Candidate 1 to kPa:

0.042 atm × 101.325 kPa/atm = 4.25765 kPa

Now compare the numerical values to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 (in kPa): 4.25765  
• Candidate 2: 4.27000

Because 4.25765 ≠ 4.27000 to six significant digits, the two predictions are not the same.

The two candidates give numeric answers: 

Candidate 1: –0.347 K  
Candidate 2: –0.35 K  

Expressed to six significant digits, these are –0.347000 and –0.350000, which differ in the third decimal place. According to Rule 4, they must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent. They do not.

The answers are single numerical values with the same unit (atm).  
Comparing them to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 24 atm → 24.000000  
• Candidate 2: 24.4 atm → 24.400000  

They differ already in the first decimal place, so they are not equal.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reasoning:
• Candidate 1 gives 24 atm.  
  – Converting to pascals: 24 atm ≈ 2.4318 × 10⁶ Pa.

• Candidate 2 gives 2.5 × 10⁶ (no unit stated).  
  – Even if we assume the intended unit is pascals, 2.5 × 10⁶ Pa differs from 2.4318 × 10⁶ Pa beyond the 6-significant-digit test (they differ beginning at the third significant digit).

• Moreover, Candidate 2 omits the unit, causing ambiguity per Rule 1.

Therefore, the answers are not the same.

• Candidate 1: 0.0245 kPa  
• Candidate 2: 24.5 Pa = 0.0245 kPa (since 1 kPa = 1000 Pa)

Thus the two predictions are equivalent.

• Candidate 1: 0.0000226 m³ mol⁻¹ = 2.26 × 10⁻⁵ m³ mol⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 2.26 × 10⁻⁵ m³ mol⁻¹

Expressing each to six significant digits we may append trailing zeros (which do not change the value):

2.26000 × 10⁻⁵ for both.

Thus the two answers are identical to six significant digits, so they are equivalent.

Candidate 1 provides −383 kJ mol⁻¹.  
Candidate 2 provides 0.5206 m² (an area, different physical quantity and unit).

Since they report different units and represent entirely different physical quantities, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The question requires a single numerical answer (the work in joules).  
Both candidates give one number with the same unit (J), so we compare the numbers directly (Rule 4).

Candidate 1: 2600 J  
Candidate 2: 2548 J  

Expressed to six significant digits:
• 2600 J → 0.002600 × 10⁶ J  
• 2548 J → 0.002548 × 10⁶ J  

The figures clearly differ in the first four significant digits, so they are not the same to six significant digits.

The question asks for a time duration.  

• Candidate 1: “9.8 h” – explicitly states the unit “hours.”  
• Candidate 2: “9.8” – gives no unit.

According to Rule 1, if a unit is omitted and multiple units could reasonably apply (seconds, minutes, hours, etc.), the omission introduces ambiguity, so the two answers are not considered equivalent even though the numeric value matches.

• Candidate 1: 20.2 min = 0.336667 h  
• Candidate 2: 0.336 (implicitly in hours) = 0.336000 h

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4), 0.336667 ≠ 0.336000.

Hence, the predictions are not equivalent.  
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 20.2 min  
Convert to hours: 20.2 min ÷ 60 = 0.336667 h (to six significant digits).

Candidate 2: 0.336 h  
Expressed to six significant digits: 0.336000 h.

Comparing the two values:
0.336667 h vs 0.336000 h → they differ starting at the fourth significant digit.  
According to Rule 4, they must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent, which they do not.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The first answer is “20.2 min.”  
The second answer is just “0.336” with no unit.

Because time could reasonably be expressed in hours, minutes, or seconds in this context, the absence of a unit on “0.336” makes the meaning ambiguous. According to Rule 1, when a unit omission can lead to confusion, the two answers are considered inequivalent.

Since the question does not explicitly fix a required unit and mass could reasonably be expressed in various units (u, kg, g), omitting the unit introduces ambiguity under Rule 1. Therefore the two answers are not considered equivalent.

Candidate 1: 0.139 mm  
Convert to metres: 0.139 mm = 0.139 × 10⁻³ m = 1.39 × 10⁻⁴ m  
Expressed to six significant digits: 1.39000 × 10⁻⁴ m

Candidate 2: 1.3886 × 10⁻⁴ m  
Expressed to six significant digits: 1.38860 × 10⁻⁴ m

Comparing the two numbers digit-by-digit to six significant digits:  
1.39000 ≠ 1.38860

Because they differ within the first six significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent under Rule 4.

Both answers give values in joules, but:

Candidate 1: 1.30 × 10⁻¹⁸ J  
Candidate 2: 1.28 × 10⁻¹⁸ J

Expressed to six significant digits:
1.30000 vs 1.28000

The numbers differ at the second significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the frequency as a wavenumber:  
556 cm⁻¹.

Converting this to hertz (ν = ṽ c):  
556 cm⁻¹ × 2.99792458 × 10¹⁰ cm s⁻¹ ≈ 1.66685 × 10¹³ Hz.

Candidate 2 states the frequency directly as  
1.67 × 10¹³ Hz.

Expressing both numbers with six significant digits:

• From Candidate 1: 1.66685 × 10¹³ Hz  
• From Candidate 2 (padding with zeros): 1.67000 × 10¹³ Hz  

Comparison to six significant digits shows a mismatch at the fourth digit (…6 6 6 8 5 vs …6 7 0 0 0).  
Thus, per Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both answers represent the same numerical value once units are made consistent.

• Candidate 1: 1.81 × 10¹⁰ m⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 1.81 × 10⁸ cm⁻¹ = 1.81 × 10⁸ cm⁻¹ × 100 m / cm = 1.81 × 10¹⁰ m⁻¹  

After conversion, they match to at least six significant digits. Thus the two predictions are equivalent.

Thus, after unit conversion they are identical.

To compare the two answers we convert them to the same unit:

100 eV × (1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J / eV) = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁷ J.

Candidate 1 gives 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷ J.

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 1.602000 × 10⁻¹⁷ J  
• Candidate 2 → 1.602177 × 10⁻¹⁷ J

They differ beginning at the fifth significant digit, so according to Rule 4 they are not considered equivalent.

The two answers are expressed in the same physical units (length):

• Candidate 1: 243 pm = 2.43 × 10⁻¹⁰ m  
• Candidate 2: 2.42 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

2.43000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m vs. 2.42000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

They differ starting at the third significant digit; therefore, they are not equal to 6-digit precision.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

The two answers give the wavelength in different units, but converting Candidate 1’s value (243 pm) to metres gives

243 pm = 243 × 10⁻¹² m = 2.43 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.

Candidate 2 gives 2.42 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.

Comparing 2.43000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m with 2.42000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m, they differ in the third significant digit, so they are not equal to six significant digits as required.

Candidate 2: 1.28 × 10⁻¹⁰ m (1.28000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m to six significant digits)

Comparing 1.29000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m with 1.28000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m, the values differ already in the third significant digit, so they do not match to six significant digits.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 27.211 eV

Convert both to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1 → 27.2110  
• Candidate 2 → 27.2114  

Since 27.2110 ≠ 27.2114, the two answers do not match to 6 significant digits. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

To compare:

• Candidate 1: 6.9 × 10⁻² s⁻¹ = 0.069 s⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 1.59 Hz = 1.59 s⁻¹  

0.069 s⁻¹ ≠ 1.59 s⁻¹ (they differ by more than an order of magnitude and do not match to six significant digits).

The question asks for two numerical estimates.  
Candidate 1 supplies:

1) 3.00000 × 10⁻⁶ W cm⁻²  
2) 7.5 × 10¹² photons cm⁻² s⁻¹  

Candidate 2 supplies:

1) 8.33 × 10⁻⁸ (unit not explicitly given)  
2) 9.23 × 10¹⁰ (unit not explicitly given)

Even ignoring the missing units in Candidate 2, the numerical values differ:

• 3 × 10⁻⁶ vs 8.33 × 10⁻⁸ (factor ≈ 36)  
• 7.5 × 10¹² vs 9.23 × 10¹⁰ (factor ≈ 81)

They do not match to six significant digits, thus are not equivalent.

The question asks for explanations for four separate phenomena.  
Both candidates give answers for all four parts, but:

• For the rainbow (part (c)) Candidate 1 cites only refraction/dispersion, omitting the essential internal reflection step that Candidate 2 includes.  
• Thus the sub-answers are not identical; Candidate 1 is less complete.

Rule 2 states that when multiple sub-answers are required, every sub-answer must match; any discrepancy makes the two responses inequivalent.

Therefore the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 only gives the general mathematical expression  
I = I₀ (sin β / β)² cos² γ and does not specify any concrete features of the pattern (such as how many fringes appear inside the central diffraction envelope or which orders are missing).

Candidate 2, in contrast, gives a specific qualitative/quantitative description: a central diffraction maximum containing nine bright fringes (m = –4 … +4) with the 5th-order fringe absent.

Because Candidate 1 never states those particular features, the two answers are not the same; Candidate 2 adds information that Candidate 1 neither confirms nor denies. Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 only gives a condition for the focal length (f ≥ 100 r) and does not supply the requested “flux increase factor.” Candidate 2 gives both required pieces of information: the flux-increase factor ((200 r / f)²) and the focal length for no increase (f = 200 r). Because Candidate 1 is missing one of the required answers and the focal-length conditions differ (≥ 100 r vs. = 200 r), the predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply

(a) the same three-term intensity expression consisting of

 a²( sin u /u )²  +  b²( sin v /v )²  + 2ab( sin u /u )( sin v /v ) cos w

(which is identical to candidate 2’s formula once we identify
u = πa sinθ/λ, v = πb sinθ/λ, w = 2πc sinθ/λ ).

(b) Special cases:

1. For a = b they both give
 I = 4a²( sin v /v )² cos²(w/2) = 4a² sinc²(πa sinθ/λ) cos²(πc sinθ/λ).

2. For a = 0 they both reduce to the single-slit term
 I = b²( sin v /v )² = b² sinc²(πb sinθ/λ).

Thus, after matching the symbols, every part of candidate 1 coincides exactly with candidate 2.  
The two answers are therefore equivalent.

Reasoning:

The problem expects three wavelength–color pairs.  
Both candidates list three pairs, but the numerical value for the red wavelength differs:

• Candidate 1: 667 nm (from 6670 Å)  
• Candidate 2: 666.67 nm

Comparing to 6 significant digits (rule 4):

667.000 nm ≠ 666.670 nm

Since at least one corresponding numerical answer does not match to 6 significant digits, the two solution sets are not exactly identical. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each list three wavelength–color pairs.

Convert Candidate 1’s Å-values to nm:
• 4000 Å = 400.000 nm  
• 5000 Å = 500.000 nm  
• 6670 Å = 667.000 nm  

Candidate 2 gives:
• 400.000 nm  
• 500.000 nm  
• 666.670 nm  

Compare each corresponding value to 6 significant digits:

1) 400.000 nm vs 400.000 nm → identical.  
2) 500.000 nm vs 500.000 nm → identical.  
3) 667.000 nm vs 666.670 nm → differ at the 4th significant digit.

Because one of the three numerical answers does not match to 6 significant digits, the two candidate answers are not equivalent according to Rule 4.

The answers give numerical values for the required angular separation:

• Candidate 1: 2″ (explicitly “2 seconds of arc”)  
• Candidate 2: 1.89 (implicitly seconds of arc, since that is the only reasonable unit here)

Even after assuming the same units, 2.00000 and 1.89000 differ well beyond six significant digits, so the two predictions are not the same.

The question asks for a calculated wavelength value.  

• Candidate 1 supplies only a formula, “λ = Δd / L,” without any numerical result or unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives a specific numerical wavelength, “632.8 nm.”

These are clearly different kinds of answers (formula vs. numerical value) and cannot be considered equivalent (Rule 6).

Both candidates give the same result for part (a) (I = I₀), but their formulas for part (b) differ:

• Candidate 1: I = 4 I₀ sin²[ (k R²)/(4 L) ] = 4 I₀ sin²[ π R²/(2 λ L) ]  
• Candidate 2: I = I₀ (π R²/(λ L))²

These two expressions are not identical; they coincide only in the small-argument limit of the sine, which the problem statement does not explicitly impose. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The question requests two specific results:  
1. The maximum temperature with full absorptance.  
2. The new maximum temperature (quantitative) after absorptance drops by half.

Candidate 1 supplies both numerical answers: 341 K and 286 K.  
Candidate 2 supplies 341 K for the first part but only a qualitative statement (“the final temperature decreases”) for the second part, lacking the required numeric value.

Since Candidate 2 omits a required answer, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates supply answers for all four sub-parts (a)–(d) and, for every sub-part, the physical conclusions match:

(a) wavelength dependence ∝ λ⁻⁴ and angular factor (1+cos²θ/ψ) – same content.  
(b) they both state that with no density fluctuations there is no net scattering (I = 0).  
(c) both state that with √N fluctuations the intensity is that of independent, incoherent molecular scatterers.  
(d) both explain enhanced scattering at high humidity as arising from larger density fluctuations/“Tyndall effect”.

No sub-answer contradicts the other; numerical factors or more detailed formulas given by Candidate 1 do not change the qualitative results asserted by Candidate 2. Hence the two sets of predictions are equivalent.

The problem has three sub-questions (a), (b), and (c).  
Candidate 1 supplies explicit mathematical patterns for (a) and (b) and gives Δf < 1/t for (c).  
Candidate 2 gives only qualitative descriptions (“narrow vertical beam”, “narrower vertical beam”) for (a) and (b) and Δf ≪ 1/t for (c).

For sub-questions (a) and (b) the two answers are clearly different: a detailed Airy/interference formula vs. a vague statement. Because not every sub-answer matches, Rule 2 declares the overall answers inequivalent.

The two candidates convey the same numerical factor (27/128).  
Candidate 1 gives the transmitted intensity explicitly as (27/128) I₀, while Candidate 2 gives the transmitted fraction 27/128; multiplying this fraction by the incident intensity I₀ yields the same expression as Candidate 1.  
Thus, after straightforward unit/quantity conversion, both answers are equivalent.  

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the transmitted intensity as (27 I₀)/128, explicitly including the incident intensity I₀.  
Candidate 2 gives only the numerical fraction 27/128 with no I₀ factor.  

Because one answer is an absolute intensity (proportional to I₀) while the other is a dimensionless ratio, the two are not exactly the same quantity; the omission of I₀ in Candidate 2 creates a mismatch per Rule 1. Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for three separate angles θ.  
Both candidates supply three corresponding expressions.

Compare each corresponding pair:

1. First diffraction minimum  
   • Cand 1: θ = ± sin⁻¹(λ/a)  
   • Cand 2: sin θ = λ/a  
   – These are mathematically the same statement: sin θ = λ/a implies θ = sin⁻¹(λ/a) (positive branch), while Cand 1 merely adds the symmetric negative angle ±, which does not conflict with Cand 2’s relation. Hence equivalent.

2. First interference minimum  
   • Cand 1: θ = ± sin⁻¹(λ/6d)  
   • Cand 2: sin θ = λ/6d  
   – Again equivalent for the same reason.

3. First interference maximum  
   • Cand 1: θ = ± sin⁻¹(λ/2d)  
   • Cand 2: sin θ = λ/2d  
   – Likewise equivalent.

Thus, for every sub-question the mathematical content of the two answers matches; the only difference is that Candidate 1 explicitly writes the ± solutions, while Candidate 2 writes the defining sine equations. According to the rules, these count as equivalent.

The two candidates give the same magnitude but opposite sign for the radial component:

Candidate 1 supplies two separate required answers: (i) the pair of refractive indices n₊/n₋ and (ii) the rotation angle ϕ.  
Candidate 2 supplies only one item—an expression for ϕ—and gives nothing for the refractive indices.

Because the original question asks for both (a) the indices (with corresponding fields) and (b) the rotation angle, Candidate 2 is incomplete. Per Rule 2, if one candidate omits any required answer while the other provides it, the two responses are not equivalent, even though the ϕ expressions themselves are algebraically the same.

(b) the rotation angle φ.

Candidate 1 supplies both: it gives formulas for n₊, n₋ and for φ.  
Candidate 2 supplies only φ and omits the required indices of refraction (and the associated electric fields).

Because Candidate 2 is missing part (a), the two candidates do not provide the same set of answers, so they are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The problem has two sub-parts ((a) and (b)), so Rule 2 applies: both candidates must give matching answers for each part.

Part (a)
• Candidate 1 gives an unfinished/truncated formula (only the first term inside the bracket appears).
• Candidate 2 supplies a complete two-term expression.
These are clearly not the same expression.

Part (b)
• Candidate 1 mentions “resultant of fields due to a point charge and a dipole with moment (1 + a³/R³)P…”.
• Candidate 2 says the field contains the original uniform field, induced dipoles (~R⁻³) and a quadrupole term (~R⁻⁴).

Both candidates give the same numerical expression for the radius, namely a = b/8.  
Candidate 1 explicitly writes the “≈” symbol, while Candidate 2 omits it, but the value itself (b divided by 8) is identical, and the problem statement asks for an approximate value. Therefore the two answers represent the same quantity.

The problem has five sub-parts (a)–(e).  

Candidate 2 supplies an explicit answer for every sub-part.  
Candidate 1 supplies only four answers. “xy = const.” corresponds to part (b) (field lines), leaving no answer for part (a) (verification of Maxwell’s equations). Therefore the two response sets are not identical or complete in the same way.

Hence the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: 5.007 × 10⁻⁸ J → 5.00700 × 10⁻⁸ J (to 6 significant digits)

The two candidates give different answers for every sub-part:

1. Conditions for E = 0 and B = 0 frames:  
   • Candidate 1 gives only the inequalities E ≤ cB and cB ≤ E, with no orthogonality requirement.  
   • Candidate 2 requires both E·B = 0 and strict inequalities E < cB or E > cB.  
   → Not the same.

2. Description of the motion for case (a)(1):  
   • Candidate 1 offers just a formula labeled “R = …”, with no explicit description of the trajectory.  
   • Candidate 2 states “cycloid motion with drift velocity E/B”.  
   → Not equivalent.

3. Momentum in the B = 0 frame for case (a)(2):  
   • The two give similar magnitudes but differ by a sign in p′ₓ, so they are not identical.  

Because they disagree on all required parts, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same overall structure and prefactors, but the location of the image‐charge term inside the absolute-value bars differs:

• Candidate 1 uses | r − (a²/s) s |  
• Candidate 2 uses | r − (a²/s²) s |

Since (a²/s) s and (a²/s²) s are different vectors (the latter has the correct magnitude a²/s expected for the image charge, whereas the former has magnitude a²), the two potentials are not the same. The discrepancy appears in both parts (a) and (b). Therefore the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 supplies three separate formulas corresponding to parts (a), (b), and (c) of the question, while Candidate 2 supplies only one formula (clearly intended for part (c) only).  
Even for the single overlapping case (c), the two formulas differ by a numerical factor (denominator 32 π² ε₀ versus 8 π with no ε₀).

Because  
• Candidate 2 does not give answers for parts (a) and (b) at all, and  
• the one common formula is not identical to Candidate 1’s,

the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The task asks for FOUR sets of vectors:

• case (a) longitudinal – rest frame  
• case (a) longitudinal – laboratory frame  
• case (b) transverse  – rest frame  
• case (b) transverse  – laboratory frame  

Candidate 2 explicitly supplies those four sets (changing only the axis labels).

Candidate 1 lists four separate “answers”, but:

– “answer 1” and “answer 3” are identical; both correspond to the longitudinal rest-frame situation.  
– “answer 2” is the longitudinal laboratory frame.  
– “answer 4” is the transverse laboratory frame (fields contain the expected γ factors).  

Candidate 1 never gives the transverse rest-frame vectors (E, B, F, a).  
Therefore Candidate 1’s response is missing one of the required four sets, whereas Candidate 2 supplies all of them.

Because at least one required part is missing from Candidate 1, the two candidates’ predictions are NOT equivalent.
The two candidates are not equivalent.

•  The question requires results for both geometry (a) head-to-tail and (b) side-by-side, each in two frames, giving four vectors in every case (E, B, F, a).  

•  Candidate 2 supplies explicit expressions for all of these situations.  

•  Candidate 1 gives four “answers’’ whose correspondence to the required sub-cases is unclear; for case (b) it does not provide a distinct rest-frame set and the directions it lists do not match Candidate 2’s.  Magnitudes and γ–factors also differ (e.g. force ∝γ in Candidate 2 but ∝1/γ in Candidate 1’s “answer 4’’).

Since at least one sub-result differs and several required components are missing or mismatched, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates each give two separate results (field inside and field outside), so both must match in every component to be equivalent (Rule 2).

Inside the sphere  
• Candidate 1:  (3 ε₀)/(ε+2 ε₀) E₀ (parallel to E₀).  
• Candidate 2:  (3 E₀)/(ε+2)  ẑ.  
If ε in candidate 1 is an absolute permittivity (so ε = ε_r ε₀), the two factors are identical, so the “inside” fields coincide.

Outside the sphere  
Expressing candidate 1 in spherical components gives  
E_r = E₀ cosθ + 2E₀ (ε−ε₀)/(ε+2ε₀) R³ cosθ / r³  
E_θ = −E₀ sinθ + E₀ (ε−ε₀)/(ε+2ε₀) R³ sinθ / r³.

Candidate 2 states  
E_r = E₀ cosθ + 2E₀ (ε−1)/(ε+2) R³ cosθ / r³  
E_θ =  +E₀ sinθ − E₀ (ε−1)/(ε+2) R³ sinθ / r³.

After identifying (ε−ε₀)/(ε+2ε₀) with (ε_r−1)/(ε_r+2), the radial components match, but the θ-components have opposite sign for both the uniform term and the dipole term. Hence the two external-field expressions are not the same.

Because at least one required component (E_θ outside) differs, the two overall answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s part (b) gives

Candidate 2’s part (b) gives 

 E′ = m c² / 2.

  (depends on the initial photon energy)

• Candidate 2:  hν′ = (m_ec²)/2  
  (a fixed value, independent of the initial photon energy)

Because their results for the scattered photon energy are not the same, the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 8.64 × 10²² A·m²

Comparison of each part:

(a) Electric field  
• Candidate 1: 𝐄 = −Q /(2π ε L r) e_r  
• Candidate 2: 𝐄 =  +Q /(2π ε L r)  
 The signs are opposite (direction reversed), so the answers differ.

(b) Capacitance  
Both give C = 2π ε L / ln(b/a); these match.

(c) Force on dielectric

• Candidate 2: F = π V²(ε − ε₀)/ln(b/a), direction: outward  
 The expressions are negatives of each other, and Candidate 1 omits direction, so they do not match.

The problem asks for two vector fields:
1. the uniform field inside the sphere ( r < a ),
2. the disturbed field outside the sphere ( r > a ).

Both candidates give both pieces.

Inside ( r < a ):
• Candidate 1:  (3 ε₂)/(ε₁+2 ε₂) E  
• Candidate 2:  (3 ε₂)/(ε₁+2 ε₂) E  
– identical.

Outside ( r > a ):
• Candidate 1:  E  +  (ε₁–ε₂)/(ε₁+2 ε₂) a³ [ 3(E·r) r / r⁵  –  E / r³ ]

Simplifying the bracket:
 3(E·r) r / r⁵ = 3(E·r̂) r̂ / r³, so the whole bracket is (1/r³)[3(E·r̂) r̂ – E].

• Candidate 2:  E  +  (a³/r³) (ε₁–ε₂)/(ε₁+2 ε₂) [ 2 cosθ r̂ + sinθ θ̂ ] E

Taking the uniform field E along the z-axis, ẑ = cosθ r̂ – sinθ θ̂, and evaluating
 3(E·r̂) r̂ – E = 3E cosθ r̂ – E(cosθ r̂ – sinθ θ̂)
        = 2E cosθ r̂ + E sinθ θ̂,

which is exactly the vector in Candidate 2. Thus the two outside‐field expressions are the same.

Both answers supply the two required fields, and each corresponding expression is mathematically identical (just written in different but equivalent forms).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give

Inside the sphere ( r < a ):

Outside the sphere ( r > a ):

Candidate 1 writes the outside field with r-vector factors that, after factoring 1/r³ and using r̂ = r /|r|, is algebraically identical to Candidate 2’s expression.

2. V(r): V₀ ln(r₂ / r) / ln(r₂ / r₁)  (same in both)

Candidate 1 gives 
B₁ = μ₀ μ_r N I / [ 2π R + (μ_r – 1)s ].

Candidate 2 gives 
B₂ = μ₀ N I / [ s + L/μ_r ].

With the geometry in the statement, L ≈ 2πR.  
Substituting this into B₂,

denominator₂ = s + (2πR)/μ_r  
             = (2πR + μ_r s)/μ_r,

so  

B₂ = μ₀ μ_r N I / ( 2πR + μ_r s ).

Hence the two expressions differ in the denominator:

• Candidate 1: 2πR + (μ_r – 1)s = 2πR + μ_r s – s  
• Candidate 2: 2πR + μ_r s.

The denominators differ by an extra “– s” term, so the formulas are not identical (and they also lead to different limiting behaviours). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two formulas are not algebraically identical.

Candidate 1: B = μ_r μ₀ NI / [2πR + (μ_r – 1)s]

Candidate 2 simplifies to:

The denominators differ by a term –s. Because these expressions are not the same for general values of s (except the trivial s = 0 case), the answers are inequivalent.

  (Even for the magnetic field, its value differs from Candidate 1’s.)

3. Propagation direction: “positive x” vs “+x” → same direction.  
4. Magnetic-field direction: “z” vs “+z”.  Saying “z-direction” ordinarily means the +z axis; Candidate 1’s wording is not contradictory with Candidate 2. Thus they denote the same direction.

Both candidates give

(a) the same four Maxwell equations (candidate 1’s factor 1/c² equals ε₀μ₀ used by candidate 2, and both equations contain ε₀ and μ₀, so they are implicitly in SI units),

(b) E→−E, B→−B when all charges are reversed,

(c) ρ unchanged, j→−j, E→−E, B unchanged under space inversion,

(d) ρ unchanged, j→−j, E unchanged, B→−B under time reversal.

Thus every sub-answer matches, so the two sets of predictions are equivalent.
Both candidates give

(a) The same four Maxwell equations; candidate 1 writes the last term as (1/c²)∂E/∂t while candidate 2 writes ε₀μ₀∂E/∂t, but in SI those are identical (μ₀ε₀ = 1/c²).  
Although candidate 1 does not explicitly say “SI”, the appearance of ε₀, μ₀ makes the unit system unambiguously SI, so no real ambiguity arises.

(b) Charge-sign reversal: E → –E, B → –B  (identical).

(c) Space inversion: ρ unchanged, j → –j, E → –E, B unchanged  (identical).

(d) Time reversal: ρ unchanged, j → –j, E unchanged, B → –B  (identical).

Thus every sub-answer supplied by the two candidates coincides, and any slight wording difference does not change the physical content.

Reasoning:

The question asks for the magnetic field (a vector quantity).  
Candidate 1 supplies the full vector (includes the \( \mathbf e_\theta \) direction).  
Candidate 2 supplies only the scalar magnitude, omitting the direction.

Although the magnitudes match, one answer is a vector and the other is only a scalar; therefore the two candidates are not providing exactly the same set of answers for each sub-part.

Both candidates answer all three sub-questions.

1. Current density  
   • C1:  j = i nₑ e² E /(mₑ ω)  
   • C2:  J = i nₑ e² E /(m ω)  
   (m = mₑ). Same expression.

2. Wave-equation in the medium  
   • C1:  ∇²E + (ω²/c²)(1 – ω_P²/ω²)E = 0  ⟺  ∇²E + (ω² – ω_P²)/c² E = 0  
   • C2:  ∇²E = (nₑ e²/ε₀ m – ω²)/c² E = (ω_P² – ω²)/c² E  
           ⇒ ∇²E + (ω² – ω_P²)/c² E = 0  
   After bringing all terms to the same side, the equations are identical.

3. Propagation condition  
   • C1:  ω² > ω_P²  (or nₑ < ε₀ m_e ω²/e²)  
   • C2:  ω > √(nₑ e²/ε₀ m) = ω_P  
   These conditions are the same (ω > ω_P).

Thus every corresponding answer is equivalent; extra, consistent information in Candidate 1 doesn’t create a conflict.

The problem asks for:

(a) the electric field E (a vector quantity) at the center of the hollow, and  
(b) the electric potential φ (a scalar) at the same point.

Candidate 1  
(a) ρ a⃗ / (3 ε₀) (vector, direction along a⃗)  
(b) ρ [3(R₁² − R₂²) − a²] / (6 ε₀)

Candidate 2  
(a) ρ a / (3 ε₀) (no vector notation, just the magnitude)  
(b) ρ [3R₁² − a² − 3R₂²] / (6 ε₀)

Comparison:

• Part (b): The bracketed expressions are identical after rearrangement, so the potentials match.

• Part (a): Candidate 1 gives the full vector E; Candidate 2 gives only the scalar magnitude, omitting direction. Because the electric field is inherently a vector quantity required by the question, the two answers differ in type/completeness.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the candidates are not equivalent.
The problem asks for two separate quantities:  
(a) the electric field E at the center of the hollow, and  
(b) the potential φ at that point.

Candidate 1 supplies two distinct answers:
– E = (ρ / 3ε₀)  a⃗  
– φ = (ρ / 6ε₀)[3(R₁² − R₂²) − a²]

Candidate 2 supplies only one expression:
– (ρ / 6ε₀)(3R₁² − a² − 3R₂²)

That single expression matches Candidate 1’s potential, but Candidate 2 gives no answer for the electric field. Because the question requires two answers and Candidate 2 provides only one, the two candidates are not equivalent according to Rule 2.

The two answers give different numerical prefactors in front of v B cos θ.

• Candidate 1: 3 ε₀  

• Candidate 2: 3 /(4π c)

In SI units ε₀ ≈ 8.85 × 10⁻¹² F m⁻¹, whereas 1/(4π c) ≈ 2.65 × 10⁻¹⁰ s m⁻¹. These are not equal, and there is no standard physical identity that makes 3 ε₀ equal to 3/(4π c). Therefore the two surface-charge densities are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different explicit factors:

• Candidate 1: σ = 3 ε₀ v B cos θ  
• Candidate 2: σ = (3 v B)/(4π c) cos θ  

In SI units ε₀ ≈ 8.85 × 10⁻¹² F m⁻¹, while 1/(4π c) ≈ 2.65 × 10⁻¹⁰ s m⁻¹. These factors differ by roughly a factor of 30, so the formulas do not produce the same numerical result in the same system of units.  

Although Candidate 2 resembles the Gaussian-unit expression, the problem statement does not specify a different unit system, and Rule 1 states that if unit choices cause ambiguity and the factors are not convertible to equality in the same units, the answers are considered inequivalent.

Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates differ by a factor of 1/c. Since c is the (dimensionful) speed of light, the two expressions are not equal in either numerical value or units. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does NOT supply the explicit electric-field expressions requested in part (a), whereas Candidate 2 does.  
Moreover, even where both give a potential for r < R, Candidate 1’s expression contains a factor R³ while Candidate 2’s has R², so the two inside-potential formulas are different.  
Because Candidate 1 is missing required information and the overlapping answers are not identical, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 fails to supply the electric-field expressions requested in part (a) (“refer to Problem 1013”), whereas Candidate 2 gives explicit inside and outside fields.  Because the question requires answers for both parts (a) and (b) and Candidate 1 is missing part (a), Rule 2 says the answers cannot be equivalent.  In addition, Candidate 1’s potential for r < R differs from Candidate 2’s by an extra factor of R, so even their part (b) results do not match.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 1: τ = (7 π² ε₀² c³ m² R³) / (2 q⁴)

Candidate 2: τ = (7 c³ m² R³) / (32 q⁴)

They differ in numerical factors (π², 2 vs 32) and in the presence/absence of ε₀. The expressions are therefore not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates express the same formula once the Coulomb constant  
k = 1/(4 π ε₀) is substituted.

Candidate 2:
τ = 7 m² c³ R³ / (32 k² q⁴)

 → k² = 1/(16 π² ε₀²)

 → 32 k² = 32 × 1/(16 π² ε₀²) = 2/(π² ε₀²)

 → τ = 7 m² c³ R³ × (π² ε₀²)/2 q⁴
   = 7 π² ε₀² c³ m² R³ / (2 q⁴)

This is exactly Candidate 1. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a non-zero expression,
 (q²)/(8π ε₀) (1/R – 1/(R+t)),

while Candidate 2 states the work is 0.  
For general positive thickness t, the expression in Candidate 1 is not zero (because 1/R ≠ 1/(R+t)). Therefore the two answers are different.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 simplifies to  

(q²)/(8π ε₀) [1/R – 1/(R+t)]  
= (q²)/(8π ε₀) [(R+t – R)/(R(R+t))]  
= (q² t)/(8π ε₀ R(R+t))   (positive).

Candidate 2 is  

–(q² t)/(8π ε₀ R(R – t))   (negative and with R–t in the denominator).

The signs differ, and the denominators R(R+t) vs. R(R–t) are not the same. Hence the two expressions are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

Candidate 1:  (q²)/(8π ε₀) · (1/R − 1/(R + t))

Candidate 2:  (q²)/(4π ε₀) · (1/R − 1/(R − t))

Differences:
1. The numerical prefactor differs (1/8 vs 1/4).
2. The second term inside the parentheses differs (1/(R + t) vs 1/(R − t)).

These expressions are not the same for general R and t, so the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers give the same formula once the unit systems are aligned.

• Candidate 1 is expressed in Gaussian/CGS units (no ε₀ or 4 π factors appear).

• Converting its e⁴ denominator to SI units (e²_cgs = e²_SI / 4π ε₀ ⇒ e⁴_cgs = e⁴_SI / (4π ε₀)²) multiplies Candidate 1 by (4π ε₀)² = 16 π² ε₀², giving

 (m² c³ a₀³ / 4 e⁴_cgs) → (4 π² ε₀² m² c³ a₀³ / e⁴_SI),

which is exactly Candidate 2 (with m = m_e).

Thus, after accounting for the different unit conventions, the two expressions are the same.

Both candidates give two expressions, one proportional to 1/r² and one proportional to r.  
These correspond to the standard results:

• Outside (r ≥ R): E = Q / (4π ε₀ r²)  
• Inside (r < R): E = Q r / (4π ε₀ R³)

Candidate 1 supplies these two expressions (though without explicitly labeling which is inside/outside), and Candidate 2 supplies the same two expressions with clear labeling. Since the formulas themselves are identical, the answers are equivalent.

The two candidates give four separate piece-wise results.  
Compare term by term:

1. Electric field E: algebraically identical after noting qr/(l)=q/l.  
2. Magnetic field B: identical since μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²).  
3. Energy density u: both give (q/l)²(1+v²/c²)/(8π²ε₀) times r²/R⁴ (inside) or 1/r² (outside); they match.  
4. Momentum density g:  

   • Candidate 1: g = v² q² r² /(4π² ε₀ c² R⁴ l²) ẑ (inside) and analogous outside.  
   • Candidate 2: g = μ₀ (q/l)² v r² /(4π² R⁴) ẑ = v q² r² /(4π² ε₀ c² R⁴ l²) ẑ (inside) and analogous outside.

Candidate 1 has an extra factor of v compared with Candidate 2 (v² vs v). Therefore their momentum-density answers are different.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two overall answers are NOT equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give the same expressions for

(a) the electric field  
(b) the magnetic field  
(c) the energy density

(after using µ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²)), but they give different expressions for

(d) the momentum density:

• Candidate 1: g ∝ v²  
• Candidate 2: g ∝ v

Since at least one of the required sub-answers differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.
The question has four sub-parts, so every sub-answer must match for the two candidates to be equivalent (Rule 2).

1. Electric field 𝐄  
   Both candidates give  
   𝐄 = (λ r)/(2π ε₀ R²) ê_r for r ≤ R and 𝐄 = (λ)/(2π ε₀ r) ê_r for r ≥ R (using λ = q/l). → Match.

2. Magnetic field 𝐁  
   Candidate 1 has (v λ r)/(2π ε₀ c² R²) ê_φ etc.; Candidate 2 has μ₀ λ v r/(2π R²) ê_φ etc. With μ₀ = 1/(ε₀ c²), these are identical. → Match.

3. Energy density u  
   Candidate 1: u₁ = (1+v²/c²) λ² r² /(8π² ε₀ R⁴).  
   Candidate 2: u₂ = λ² r² /(8π² R⁴) (1/ε₀² + μ₀ v²/ε₀) = (1+v²/c²) λ² r² /(8π² ε₀² R⁴).  
   u₂ has an extra factor 1/ε₀ in the denominator compared with u₁ → Not equal.

4. Momentum density 𝐠  
   Candidate 1: 𝐠₁ = v² λ² /(4π² ε₀ c²) (r²/R⁴) ê_z.  
   Candidate 2: 𝐠₂ = μ₀ λ² v /(4π²) (r²/R⁴) ê_z = v λ² /(4π² ε₀ c²) (r²/R⁴) ê_z.  
   𝐠₁ differs from 𝐠₂ by a factor of v → Not equal.

Since the energy density and momentum density do not match, the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
C′ = C (ε + ε₀)/(2 ε₀).

Candidate 2 gives  
C′ = C (1 + ε)/2.

Re-expressing candidate 1 in the form C′ = C (1 + ε/ε₀)/2 shows that the two answers coincide only if the ε in candidate 2 is actually the ratio ε/ε₀ (i.e., a dimensionless relative permittivity), whereas candidate 1 evidently treats ε as an absolute permittivity (with the same units as ε₀). Because the problem statement provides only the single symbol ε and does not define it in both ways, the two formulas are not identical as written: candidate 1 contains an explicit ε₀ while candidate 2 does not. Therefore, the two candidates are not provably equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: C′ = [(ε + ε₀)/(2 ε₀)] C  
Candidate 2: C′ = [(1 + ε)/2] C  

In the problem statement ε is called the “dielectric constant,” which is normally the dimensionless relative permittivity.  

• In Candidate 2, ε is used just as that dimensionless number, so the expression is unit-consistent.

• In Candidate 1, ε is added to ε₀ (which has units of F m⁻¹). This makes sense only if ε is the absolute permittivity (ε = ε_r ε₀). But the problem defines ε as the dielectric constant, not the absolute permittivity. Therefore Candidate 1 is using a quantity with units, whereas Candidate 2 is using a dimensionless quantity. Under the stated interpretation of ε, the two formulas are not the same.

Because they rely on different interpretations/units for ε and yield different algebraic expressions when ε is taken as the dielectric constant given in the problem, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not the same:

• Candidate 1: C′ = C (ε + ε₀)/(2 ε₀)  
  – This formula only makes dimensional sense if ε has the same units as ε₀ (i.e. ε is an absolute permittivity).

• Candidate 2: C′ = C (1 + ε)/2  
  – This formula is dimensionally consistent only if ε is dimensionless (i.e. ε is the relative dielectric constant).

Because the two answers rely on ε having different physical meanings/units, they cannot be considered equivalent under Rule 1.

Reasoning:

The question asks for vector quantities ( B, J_b, K_b ) including their directions.

• Magnetic field:
  – Candidate 2 gives full vector: ϕ-direction.
  – Candidate 1 gives only the magnitude (no direction).  
    ⇒ incomplete.

• Volume and surface bound currents:
  – Candidate 2 supplies both magnitude and the z-direction.
  – Candidate 1 lists only scalar expressions (no direction).  
    ⇒ incomplete.

Because Candidate 1 omits the directional information that is explicitly provided in Candidate 2, the two answers are not fully identical for every requested sub-result.

The two candidates do not give identical answers for every requested quantity:

3. Stage-3 magnification: Candidate 1 gives +0.714, Candidate 2 gives +0.714 but uses opposite sign convention earlier; moreover Candidate 2 omits the Stage-3 object distance that Candidate 1 supplies.  
4. Candidate 2 also provides explicit incident directions for stages that differ from what Candidate 1 lists (Candidate 1 does not list them).

Because at least one required sub-answer differs (signs and some omissions), the predictions are not equivalent under Rules 2 and 4.

The two candidates give different forms of the result:

• Candidate 1 supplies a vector: 𝐅 = −(π μ₀ σ² ω² R⁴ / 4) ẑ.  
• Candidate 2 supplies only the positive scalar magnitude π μ₀ σ² ω² R⁴ / 4.

Because one answer is a vector (with a specified direction) and the other is just a scalar, the two responses are not identical objects. Under Rule 6 this type mismatch means the candidates are not considered equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives a vector force  
F = −(π/4) μ₀ σ² ω² R⁴ ẑ  
(in magnitude the same expression but pointing in the −z direction).

Candidate 2 supplies only the positive scalar magnitude  
(π/4) μ₀ σ² ω² R⁴.

Because one answer specifies direction (including a negative sign) while the other gives only a magnitude with no direction, the two predictions are not identical. Under the rules, this mismatch in provided information makes them inequivalent.

The magnitude in Candidate 1 is |F⃗| = (π/4) μ₀ σ² ω² R⁴, exactly the same as Candidate 2.  
Candidate 1 simply includes the direction (attractive, toward the other hemisphere).

   = 3π/2 – atan(ρ/2).

2) –(π/2 + atan(ρ/2))  
   = –π/2 – atan(ρ/2).

Adding 2π to candidate 2 gives  
–π/2 – atan(ρ/2) + 2π = 3π/2 – atan(ρ/2),

which is exactly the same as candidate 1. Since a phase is defined modulo 2π, the two expressions represent the same phase shift.

The problem asks for three distinct results:
1. Force between the two dipoles.
2. Torque on m₂ when it is mis-aligned by θ.
3. The equilibrium orientation.

Candidate 1 supplies only the force and the torque (and each expression is even incomplete: both are missing any r–dependence and are truncated). It gives no equilibrium-orientation answer.

Candidate 2 supplies all three required results (force, torque, and θ = 0 for equilibrium).

Because Candidate 1 omits one of the required answers, the two candidates cannot be equivalent (Rule 2).
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different expressions for every requested quantity:

1. Force:
   • Candidate 1:  F = –3 μ₀ m₁ m₂ ẑ  (no r-dependence, no 1/2π factor)  
   • Candidate 2:  F = 3 μ₀ m₁ m₂ /(2π r⁴)

2. Torque:
   • Candidate 1:  N = –μ₀ m₁ m₂ sinθ ŷ  (no r-dependence, no 1/2π factor)  
   • Candidate 2:  τ = μ₀ m₁ m₂ sinθ /(2π r³)

3. Equilibrium orientation:
   • Candidate 1: not given  
   • Candidate 2: θ = 0

Because the formulas differ and Candidate 1 omits the equilibrium part, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question requires three separate answers.  
Both candidates give answers for all three parts, but their answers for part (a) are different:

• Candidate 1:  I = |q ω sin(ωt)| (time-dependent magnitude)  
• Candidate 2:  I = q ω (time-independent)

Since these expressions are not the same, the two sets of answers are not identical.  
Therefore, the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same electric-field vector:

E = (1/4π ε₀)(2p cos θ / r³  r̂  +  p sin θ / r³  θ̂).

That is exactly equivalent to p/(4π ε₀ r³)(2 cos θ r̂ + sin θ θ̂).

For the second part (pendulum behaviour) each candidate merely states that the charge swings like a pendulum; Candidate 1 adds some extra (and unrequested) formulas, but extra material is permitted as long as the required answers are present. Nothing that Candidate 1 adds contradicts Candidate 2’s statement, and both meet the stated requirement.

Hence the two responses are effectively the same with respect to what the problem asks.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question effectively has two required parts:
1. The electric-field expression of the dipole in spherical coordinates.
2. An explanation/demonstration that a released charge moves like a pendulum.

Candidate 1 supplies:
• an electric-field formula (same as Candidate 2),  
• an explicit force formula containing “mg …”,  
• an additional formula for mass.

Candidate 2 supplies:
• the same electric-field formula,  
• only a qualitative statement about the pendulum motion (no extra formulas).

Because Candidate 1 includes extra predicted results (force and mass relations) that are not provided (or matched) by Candidate 2, the two candidates do not present identical sets of answers to all sub-parts. Under Rule 2, this discrepancy makes the two responses inequivalent.

• Candidate 2: 2.40000… × 10¹⁹  

They differ beginning at the third significant digit, so the answers are not identical to 6 significant digits.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Part (a): Both give Q = 0, S = −2, B = 2, 6 quarks → agree.  
• Part (b): Candidate 1 gives 4.208 GeV/c (≈ 4208 MeV/c). Candidate 2 gives 4204 MeV/c. They differ by 4 MeV; they do not match to 6 significant digits.  
• Part (c): Candidate 1 lists several strong decays; Candidate 2 says strong decays are forbidden. Contradictory.

Since they disagree on at least one sub-answer, the overall answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same answers for part (a), but:

• For part (b) they give different numerical momenta:  
  – C1: 4.208 GeV/c (≈ 4208 MeV/c)  
  – C2: 4205 MeV/c (4.205 GeV/c)  
  To 6 significant digits these differ (4.20800 vs 4.20500), violating Rule 4.

• For part (c) they contradict one another: C1 says strong decays such as H → Λ n are allowed, whereas C2 says strong decays are forbidden.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent:

• They give different explanations for several specific reactions/decays.  
  – Example: for p + n → Λ⁰ + Σ⁺, Candidate 1 says ΔS = –2, Candidate 2 says ΔS = –1.  
  – Similar mismatches appear in other items (energy conservation, baryon number, etc.).

• Because at least one sub-answer differs, Rule 2 makes the overall answers inequivalent.

Lower limit:

The question has three separate sub-questions, so every sub-answer must coincide for the candidates to be equivalent (Rule 2).

Sub-answer (a):
• Candidate 1: “E_ν ≈ 1 MeV” (a single fixed value)  
• Candidate 2: “The neutrino’s energy varies, with a maximum equal to the decay’s Q-value” (states a continuous spectrum, not a single number)

These two statements are clearly different; they are not convertible or reconcilable.

Because they disagree on sub-answer (a), the entire sets of answers are not equivalent, even though sub-answers (b) and (c) match.

The question has four sub-parts, so each candidate must supply four matching pieces of information.

Sub-part (b) is numerical:
• Candidate 1: “about 210 MeV”
• Candidate 2: “~200 MeV”

According to Rule 4, two numerical answers are considered the same only if they match to 6 significant digits after expressing them with the same exponent.  
210 MeV = 2.10000 × 10² MeV  
200 MeV = 2.00000 × 10² MeV  

These values differ (2.10000 vs 2.00000), so they are not identical to 6 significant digits. Because at least one sub-answer differs, the entire sets of answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 supplies two numerical answers:

1. Energy: 6.7 × 10⁶ MeV  (= 6.7 TeV)
2. Magnetic field: 3.49 × 10⁻³ T  (≈ 35 G)

It does not explicitly state whether Earth’s actual field is sufficient.

Candidate 2 supplies:

1. Energy: approximately 6.7 TeV (same as 6.7 × 10⁶ MeV)
2. Statement: Earth’s magnetic field is not strong enough (no numerical value given).

Because the second sub-answer differs—Candidate 1 gives only a numerical field value while Candidate 2 gives a qualitative “not strong enough”—the two responses are not identical. Rule 2 requires each sub-answer to match; here they do not.

The question expects a single numerical ratio (order-of-magnitude).

Candidate 1: 2 × 10⁷  
Candidate 2: 10⁷  

Both answers are numbers with the same (implicit) unit, so compare the values directly (Rule 4).  
2.00000 × 10⁷ ≠ 1.00000 × 10⁷.

They differ by a factor of 2; hence they are not identical answers.

The problem asks for six separate answers (parts a–f).  
Both candidates provide six answers, so we compare each corresponding value.

Sub-answer comparisons:

a) Different algebraic forms (extra factors differ).  
b) 1.18 × 10⁻²⁵ vs 1.10 × 10⁻²⁵ cm²/sr – not identical to 6 significant digits.  
c) 5.58 × 10³ vs 5.06 × 10³ s⁻¹ – different.  
d) 3.47 × 10⁻²⁴ vs 3.25 × 10⁻²³ cm² – different by an order of magnitude.  
e) 2.09 × 10⁹ vs 1.93 × 10¹⁰ s⁻¹ – different by an order of magnitude.  
f) 2.72 × 10⁻² vs 0.153 rad – different by more than a factor of 5.

Since at least one sub-answer (in fact, several) differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different expressions for part (a) and, for every numerical part (b)-(f), their values differ well beyond 6 significant digits. Hence the two response sets are not equivalent.

The question requires, for each of the four listed symmetries, the set of interactions (S, E, W) in which the symmetry has **not** been observed to be violated.  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different sets for two of the four items:

a) both give S → match  
b) C1: S,E vs C2: S → mismatch  
c) both give S,E → match  
d) C1: S,E,W vs C2: S,E → mismatch

Because there is at least one discrepancy (indeed, two discrepancies) in the required lists, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 do not give the same answers.

Part (a):
• Both list dimensionless couplings, but Candidate 1 quotes ~10-5 for the weak coupling while Candidate 2 quotes ~10-6; Candidate 1 states a range 1–10 for strong, Candidate 2 gives ≈1. Even if these magnitudes are similar, they are not identical numbers (Rule 4).  
• More importantly, equivalence must be judged for the whole question, not just one number.

Part (b):
• Candidate 1 simply says “Strong: conservation of all quantities,” and for EM/weak gives cryptic ΔI statements, omitting many required conservation laws.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly lists which quantities are conserved and which are violated, matching standard physics.

Because the set of conservation laws stated by the two candidates are clearly different and Candidate 1’s list is incomplete and inconsistent with Candidate 2’s, the two responses are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 9).

Candidate 2: ((m_Λ − m_p)^2 + m_K^2 − m_π^2) / [2 (m_Λ − m_p)]

The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 gives an inequality, depends on Z³, and is expressed in V/cm.  
   For Z = 1 it is ≳ 2 × 10⁹ V/cm = ≳ 2 × 10¹¹ V/m, and for other Z it scales as Z³.

• Candidate 2 gives a fixed value 2.6 × 10¹⁰ V/m.

Even after unit conversion, they differ by almost an order of magnitude for Z = 1, and Candidate 1 varies with Z whereas Candidate 2 does not. Therefore the predictions are not the same.

The question asks for two separate answers:
(a) β  
(b) rest energy (an energy quantity, unit MeV)

Comparison of the two candidates:

1. β  
   • Candidate 1: 1/3  
   • Candidate 2: 1/3  
   → identical.

2. Rest energy  
   • Candidate 1: 136 MeV/c² (unit of mass)  
   • Candidate 2: 136 MeV (unit of energy)

The second answers differ in physical unit: MeV/c² vs MeV. These are not the same quantity; giving mass instead of energy does not satisfy the stated request. Hence the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

1) n → p + e⁻  
   • C1: angular momentum & lepton number  
   • C2: lepton number only  
   (C1 contains an extra law not present in C2.)

2) n → π⁺ + e⁻  
   • C1: baryon number & lepton number  
   • C2: baryon number only  
   (Again, C1 lists an extra law.)

Because Rule 2 requires the answers to match exactly for every sub-problem, the additional conservation laws listed by Candidate 1 constitute discrepancies. Hence the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

1) 329 MeV vs 329 (unit omitted) – same number but missing unit for candidate 2.  
2) 448 MeV/c vs 447.6 (MeV/c implied) – differ by 0.4; not identical to 6 significant digits.  
3) 0.955 vs 0.954 – differ in the third decimal place; not identical to 6 significant digits.  
4) 1.32 × 10⁻¹³ cm vs 1.322 × 10⁻¹³ cm – differ; not identical to 6 significant digits.

Because at least one sub-answer differs (and units are incomplete for candidate 2), the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rules 1, 2, 4).
The problem asks for four numerical answers (a)–(d).  
Both candidates supply four answers with the same units, but:

• (b) 448 MeV/c vs 447.6 MeV/c – differ at the 3rd significant digit (448.000 vs 447.600).  
• (c) 0.955 vs 0.954 – differ at the 3rd significant digit.  
• (d) 1.32 × 10⁻¹³ cm vs 1.322 × 10⁻¹³ cm – differ at the 4th significant digit.

Since at least one sub-answer fails to match to 6 significant digits, the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 4).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates express the same numerical value:

Candidate 1: 8.46 × 10⁻⁴ amu = 0.000846 amu  
Candidate 2: 0.000846 amu

After padding with trailing zeros to six significant digits (8.46000 × 10⁻⁴ amu vs. 8.46000 × 10⁻⁴ amu), they coincide exactly. Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives:
1. an incomplete (missing) value for Γ̄K⁰n/ΓK⁻p,
2. “≪ 1” for Γπ⁻p/ΓK⁻p,
3. 0 for Γπ⁺π⁻/ΓK⁻p.

Candidate 2 gives definite numerical values:
1, 0, and ½ respectively.

Because at least one sub-answer differs (and one is missing/undefined), the two sets of predictions are not identical.

The question lists the possible answers explicitly with units of s⁻¹.  
Candidate 1 chooses “10³ s⁻¹,” while Candidate 2 writes simply “10³.”  
Given the context (frequency) there is only one reasonable unit (s⁻¹). Candidate 2 is clearly pointing to the same option value, merely omitting the explicit unit.  
Therefore the two predictions refer to the same choice.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates point to the same choice among the four options provided:

• Candidate 1: “10^3 s⁻¹”  
• Candidate 2: “10^3”

The only difference is that Candidate 2 omits the explicit “s⁻¹” unit. Since every listed option in the problem statement already carries that unit, the omission does not introduce ambiguity: “10^3” can only correspond to “10^3 s⁻¹.” Therefore the two answers select the same option, making them equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both provide five numerical coefficients, but several of the corresponding values differ greatly (e.g., asymmetry term 92.80 MeV vs. 23.2 MeV, pairing term 11.2 MeV vs. 34 MeV).

The question expects numerical answers (or numerical plus unit answers) for each of the four parts (with part (a) itself requiring four separate numbers).  

Comparison:

1. Part (a):  
   • Candidate 1 gives: own radius = 1 µm, own length = 200 m, opposite length = 0.01 µm, and omits the opposite radius entirely.  
   • Candidate 2 gives: own radius = 1 µm, own length ≈ 195.7 m, opposite radius = 1 µm, opposite length ≈ 0.0102 µm.  
   – Different values for lengths and candidate 1 is missing one required quantity. Hence inequivalent.

2. Part (b): 6.67 × 10⁻⁷ s vs 6.52 × 10⁻⁷ s → different to 6 significant digits.

3. Part (c): Both give 9.6 × 10⁵ G (candidate 1 in scientific notation, candidate 2 as 960 000 G). Although the magnitude matches, part (c) alone cannot salvage overall equivalence.

4. Part (d): 1.15 × 10⁻³ rad vs 5.73 × 10⁻⁴ rad → different.

Since at least one required sub-answer differs (in fact, several do, and candidate 1 omits one value entirely), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reasoning:

1. The question has three sub-parts.  Candidate 1 gives only one simple resolution criterion for (a) and leaves out other explicit criteria (interaction strength, penetration depth, internal structure, etc.) that Candidate 2 lists.  Hence the two answers differ in content and completeness for part (a) (violates Rule 2/9).

2. For part (b) Candidate 1 lists only one or two brief pros/cons for each probe, while Candidate 2 provides a fuller, partially different set.  Several advantages/disadvantages that appear in Candidate 2 (e.g., proton Coulomb repulsion, neutron absorption) are absent in Candidate 1, so the two responses are not the same (Rule 9).

3. For part (c) Candidate 1 offers a mostly negative remark; Candidate 2 gives a balanced appraisal with different details.  They do not match.

Because the required information is not equally covered and the content differs in every sub-part, the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same numerical value, 1 × 10⁻⁹, for the expected accuracy.  
Candidate 2 merely re-expresses this as a percentage (1 × 10⁻⁹ corresponds to 0.0000001 % error).  
No additional distinct units are introduced, and the question itself asks for an “accuracy,” which is naturally dimensionless.  
Therefore the two answers are equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers should give a single numerical estimate of the accuracy.

• Candidate 1 gives one value: 1 × 10⁻⁹.  
• Candidate 2 states “on the order of 0.1 parts per billion” (which is 1 × 10⁻¹⁰) and in the same sentence calls this “approximately 10⁻⁹.” These two numbers differ by a factor of ten, so Candidate 2 effectively supplies two inconsistent values.

Because Candidate 2 provides multiple, non-matching numerical answers, the two candidates’ predictions are not the same.

Candidate 1  
Eₙ = [ h α (β + 1) n E₀^β ]^{1/(β + 1)}

Candidate 2  
Eₙ = E₀ [ α (β + 1) ħ n / E₀ ]^{1/(β + 1)}
     = E₀^{β/(β+1)} [ α (β + 1) ħ n ]^{1/(β + 1)}

After rewriting Candidate 1 in the same style,
Eₙ = E₀^{β/(β+1)} [ α (β + 1) h n ]^{1/(β + 1)}.

Thus both formulas are identical except that Candidate 1 contains h (Planck’s constant) while Candidate 2 contains ħ = h/(2π).  
This introduces the factor (1/2π)^{1/(β+1)}, so the two expressions give different numerical results.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give

E_n ∝ [ h α (β+1) n E_0^β ]^{1/(β+1)}

because 2πħ = h.  
Hence the expressions are algebraically identical.

Candidate 1 expresses the first-order correction as  

  ΔE₁ = α₀ α / √(α₀² + 2β)

where the symbol α₀ is never defined in the problem statement.  
Candidate 2 writes the correction explicitly as  

  ΔE₂ = α √(m ω / ( m ω + 2β ħ )).

Unless one makes an extra assumption (e.g. α₀ ≡ √(m ω/ħ)), the two formulas cannot be shown to be identical, and Candidate 1 remains ambiguous. Because Candidate 1 introduces an undefined parameter, the two answers are not guaranteed to be the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The problem statement defines the parameters m, ω, β, α (and implicitly ħ).  
Candidate 2 gives the energy only in terms of those quantities.

Candidate 1 introduces an extra symbol “α₀” that is nowhere defined in the question. Because the meaning (and therefore the numerical value and units) of α₀ is ambiguous, we cannot be sure that

ħ ω + α₀ α / √(α₀² + 2β)

is the same as

ħ ω + α / √(1 + 2βħ/(m ω)).

Unless α₀ were explicitly specified to satisfy α₀² = m ω/ħ, the two formulas are not guaranteed to coincide. The undefined extra parameter makes Candidate 1’s answer incomplete/ambiguous relative to the problem’s variable set, so by Rule 1 the two answers must be judged inequivalent.

The two candidates give formally similar expressions, but Candidate 1 omits the factor β (=1/kT) in every Boltzmann factor while Candidate 2 includes it. Because ε is an energy and the exponent must be dimensionless, dropping β changes the functional dependence on temperature and makes the expressions physically different. Hence the answers are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates supply answers for all required sub-questions, but:

1.  In every Boltzmann-factor they should have the exponent –β ε ( β = 1/kT ).  
    • Candidate 2 writes the factors correctly as e^{-βε}, e^{-2βε}, …  
    • Candidate 1 omits β and writes e^{-ε}, e^{-2ε}, …  

   Because β carries units, dropping it changes the functional form of Z and ⟨E⟩, not merely their notation.

2.  The numerical coefficients in front of the exponentials otherwise match, but Rule 1 states that if one answer omits an essential factor and this causes ambiguity, the two answers are not equivalent.

Therefore the two sets of answers are not the same.
The two candidates give the same algebraic polynomials, but Candidate 1 omits the essential temperature (or β = 1/kT) factor in every Boltzmann-factor exponent, writing e^{-ε}, e^{-2ε}, … instead of the required e^{-ε/(kT)}, e^{-2ε/(kT)}, ….  Because this missing factor changes the functional dependence on temperature, the answers are not identical.  Hence the candidates’ results are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 supplies explicit answers for all four required parts:  
(a) \(E_0 = \hbar\omega/2\)  
(b) \(\alpha = m\omega/(2\hbar)\)  
(c) \(\psi_1 \propto x e^{-\alpha x^{2}}\)  
(d) \(\psi_{m}(r,\theta,\varphi)=N_{m}\,r\,Y_{1m}(\theta,\varphi)\,e^{-\alpha^{2}r^{2}/2}\).

Candidate 2 gives explicit expressions for parts (b), (c), and (d), but for part (a) it only says that the ground-state energy “is shown to be the minimum compatible with the uncertainty principle,” without stating the numerical value \(\hbar\omega/2\).

Because Candidate 2 omits the required explicit ground-state energy while Candidate 1 provides it, the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).
The two candidates give matching answers for parts (a), (b), and (c), but their answers for part (d) differ:

• Candidate 1’s radial Gaussian factor is exp[ −½ α² r² ],  
• Candidate 2’s radial Gaussian factor is exp[ −α r² ].

These are not the same (different power of α and extra ½). Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The problem asks for TWO numerical/analytic answers: the energy shifts of the 1s state and of the 2p state.  
Candidate 1 supplies

• E′₁₀ = 2 e² r_p² / (5 a³)  
• E′₂₁ = e² r_p⁴ / (1120 a⁵)

Candidate 2 supplies

• ΔE₁s = e² r_p² / (10 π ε₀ a₀³)  
• ΔE₂p = 0

1. Different unit systems: Candidate 1 uses Gaussian–cgs (no ε₀, no 4π); Candidate 2 uses SI (ε₀, π). Without additional conversions these are not numerically the same.

2. Even ignoring the unit-system difference, the numerical coefficients and the functional dependence differ (Candidate 1’s 2p shift ∝ r_p⁴ and is non-zero, while Candidate 2 says it is exactly zero).

Hence, the two candidates give different answers for at least one of the required sub-problems. Under Rule 2 they are inequivalent.
The question asks for two specific energy shifts: one for the 1s state and one for the 2p state.

Candidate 1 gives
• ΔE₁ₛ = (2 e² r_p²)/(5 a³)  
• ΔE₂ₚ = (e² r_p⁴)/(1120 a⁵)

Candidate 2 gives
• ΔE₁ₛ = (e² r_p²)/(10 π ε₀ a₀³)  
• ΔE₂ₚ = 0

Comparing term by term:

1. The 1s expressions differ by numerical factors and by whether 4π ε₀ is explicit or implicit, so they are not the same.
2. The 2p results are completely different (non-zero vs. zero).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem has three requested sub-answers (a), (b), and (c).

Comparison:

(a) Both candidates state that the time derivative of the norm is zero → same.

(b) Candidate 1 just writes the time-independent Schrödinger equation (eigenvalue equation).  
Candidate 2 explicitly says the state only picks up a phase and therefore remains an eigenstate. These statements are not identical; Candidate 1 omits the time-evolution point that Candidate 2 includes.

(c) Candidate 2 gives the coefficient in general form ∫ψn* ψ(x,0) dx; Candidate 1 inserts a specific prefactor √(1/2a) that assumes a particular normalization for the initial constant function. The expressions are therefore different.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates’ total answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem has three sub-parts, so each candidate must give three corresponding answers.  
Compare the two sets, sub-answer by sub-answer:

(a) Schrödinger equation  
• Candidate 1: full time-dependent equation  
  iħ ∂ψ/∂t = −(ħ²/2m) ∇²ψ  
• Candidate 2: time-independent eigenvalue equation  
  −(ħ²/2m) ∇²ψ = Eψ  
These are not the same equation; one contains the time derivative, the other does not. Hence the two sub-answers are different.

(b) Ground-state wave-function  
Both candidates give exactly the same normalized function:  
(2/L)^{3/2} sin(πx/L) sin(πy/L) sin(πz/L)  → identical.

(c) Counting states with energy < E  
After expressing h in terms of ħ and simplifying, both formulas reduce to the identical expression  
N = (π/6)(8mL²E/h²)^{3/2} = (4π/3)(mL²E/2ħ²π²)^{3/2}.  
Thus the two (c) answers are equivalent.

Because sub-answer (a) is not the same in the two candidates, the complete answer sets are not equivalent according to Rule 2.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates supply answers for all three sub-parts, so we compare each part:

(a) Schrödinger equation  
• Candidate 1 gives the time-dependent form: iħ ∂ψ/∂t = –(ħ²/2m)∇²ψ.  
• Candidate 2 gives the time-independent form: –(ħ²/2m)∇²ψ = Eψ.  
These are different equations; they are not mathematically identical.

(b) Wave-function  
Both give exactly the same normalized ground-state wave-function.

(c) State-count formula  
Algebraic manipulation shows the two expressions are equivalent.

Because part (a) disagrees, the overall sets of answers are not identical. Under Rule 2, any discrepancy in the required sub-answers makes the candidates inequivalent.

Both candidates supply answers for all four sub-parts, so we compare each item.

(a) Hamiltonian: identical form  (J²/2I – dE cosθ).

(b) Unperturbed spectrum and degeneracy: identical (Eₗ = ħ²l(l+1)/2I, (2l+1)-fold).

(c) Second-order Stark shift:

 • Candidate 1: ΔE = I d²E² [l(l+1) – 3m²] / [ħ² l(l+1)(2l–1)(2l+3)]  
 • Candidate 2: ΔE = I d²E² [l(l+1) – 3m²] / [ħ² (2l–1)(2l+1)(2l+3)]

The denominators differ: Candidate 1 contains l(l+1) but lacks (2l+1), whereas Candidate 2 contains (2l+1) but not l(l+1). Evaluating at, say, l=1 gives 10 versus 15, proving the expressions are not equivalent.

(d) Qualitative explanation similar, but because the quantitative result in (c) disagrees, the overall answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question has four sub-parts (a)–(d).  
Candidate 1 supplies a separate answer for each of them.  
Candidate 2 gives only one list of five numbers and does not address the other required sub-answers, nor does it match Candidate 1’s individual results.

 |j = l – ½, m = l – ½⟩.

Candidate 2 supplies only the expansion for  
 |j = l – ½, m = l – ½⟩.

Because the question asks for all states with m = l – ½ (“those states”, implying both possible j values), Candidate 2 is missing the |j = l + ½, m = l – ½⟩ case. By Rule 2, an answer that omits a required sub-answer is incomplete, so the two candidates are not equivalent. (The overall sign difference in the common state is merely a global phase and thus irrelevant, but incompleteness already makes the answers inequivalent.)

   • Candidate 2 answers this.  
   • Candidate 1 gives no answer at all.  
   → By Rule 2, omission of one required answer makes the sets inequivalent.

2. Even within parts (a)–(e) the content does not match exactly (e.g. Candidate 1 says I_e = I_c/2, while Candidate 2 predicts only a “reduced-contrast” pattern, not explicitly half-contrast).

Comparing 3.80000 vs 3.81000, they differ at the 2nd decimal place, so by Rule 4 (must match to 6 significant digits) they are not equivalent. The missing unit in Candidate 2 does not rescue equivalence because the numerical values already disagree.

Both answers give the same numerical expression once the ground–state binding energy |E₀| is rewritten in the same units as candidate 1.

|E₀|  = e²/(2a₀)

Candidate 2: ΔE = (4/3)(R/a₀)²|E₀|
               = (4/3)(R²/a₀²)(e²/2a₀)
               = (2/3) e² R² / a₀³

Candidate 1: ΔE = (2/3) e² R² / a₀³

Hence the two results are identical; the sign and magnitude match exactly.
The two expressions are not the same.

Substituting |E₀| = e²/(2a₀) (in any consistent system of electromagnetic units) into Candidate 2:

ΔE₂ = −(4/3)(R²/a₀²)·|E₀|
     = −(4/3)(R²/a₀²)·(e²/2a₀)
     = −(2/3)(e²R²/a₀³).

Candidate 1 gives + (2/3)(e²R²/a₀³).

They differ by a sign, so the predictions are inequivalent.

We have to compare the two full sets of answers to every sub-question (a)–(d).

(a)  
• Candidate 1 lists only continuity of ψ and the derivative jump; it does **not** mention Bloch periodicity.  
• Candidate 2 lists the same two conditions and also explicitly imposes Bloch’s theorem.  
→ The two answers are not the same.

(b)  
• Candidate 1: cos ka + (Ω/k) sin ka = cos Ka.  
• Candidate 2: cos(k₀a) + (mV₀b/ħ²k₀) sin(k₀a) = 1.  
The right-hand sides differ (cos Ka vs 1). Only if K were set to 0 would they coincide, but Candidate 1 never fixes K. Hence the equations are not identical.

Because already one sub-answer is different, the two candidates are overall not equivalent (Rule 2).

Therefore the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not the same.

Candidate 1: (A² m² e²)/(9 ħ⁴)

Candidate 2: (m e A / (12 π ε₀ ħ²))² = (A² m² e²)/(9 (4 π ε₀)² ħ⁴)

Thus candidate 2 contains the extra factor (4 π ε₀)⁻² that is missing from candidate 1. Since one answer is written in a system that explicitly includes ε₀ (SI) while the other omits it (implying Gaussian-cgs units), the two quantities are not directly the same, and the question does not specify which unit system to use. Therefore the predictions are inequivalent.

Candidate 1 says the probability is about 16 % (i.e., 0.160000 to six significant digits).

Candidate 2 gives the exact expression erfc(1) ≈ 0.157299.

Comparing 0.160000 and 0.157299 to six significant digits shows they differ, so the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different results for the same quantity.

The two candidates give their four energy‐level expressions in different units/formats:

• Candidate 1 includes factors of ℏ and ℏ² (e.g.  ℏA + ℏ²B/4).  
• Candidate 2 omits those factors (e.g.  A + B/4).

Because the Hamiltonian as written involves spin operators that carry factors of ℏ, these two sets of expressions are not written in the same units, and no conversion between them is provided. Under Rule 1 (unit consistency) the answers must therefore be regarded as inequivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates list four energy eigenvalues, which is the correct number for two spin-½ particles.  

Compare each level:

Candidate 1:          Candidate 2 (with ħ = 1):
1.  ħA + (ħ²/4)B   ↔   A + B/4  
2.        (ħ²/4)B   ↔         B/4  
3. –ħA + (ħ²/4)B   ↔ –A + B/4  
4. –(3/4)ħ²B       ↔ –3B/4  

Setting ħ = 1 (a common choice of units), every expression in Candidate 1 matches the corresponding expression in Candidate 2. Thus, after the straightforward unit conversion allowed by Rule 1, the two lists are the same set of energies.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The two candidates give manifestly different expressions for the arrival-time probability current.

1. Candidate 1 supplies an explicit closed formula containing the parameters ℏ, m, L, t and a specific length scale a, together with the Gaussian factor exp[ … ].

2. Candidate 2 gives a completely different, more abstract expression: (m L)/(ℏ t²) |φ(mL/ℏ t)|², where φ(k) is the momentum-space wavefunction of the initial state.  It is not the same functional form as Candidate 1; it only becomes a concrete function when φ(k) is specified.

Because the two answers are not the same mathematical expression and do not reduce to one another without additional assumptions, they are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 provides a specific closed-form expression that depends on the parameter a and contains the factor  
 exp[ −L²/(a²(1+α²)) ] with α = ħt/(ma²) and an overall prefactor ∝ α/(1+α²)^{3/2}.  

Candidate 2 gives a completely different general formula written as  
 (mL)/(2πħt²)|∫dx e^{−imLx/ħt} ψ₀(x)|².  
When one inserts the Gaussian ground state (the usual choice for “ground state in a small region”) into Candidate 2, the resulting expression is  
 j₂ = (ħL)/(√π m a³ α²) exp[−L²/(a² α²)],  
which is NOT the same functional form as Candidate 1 (different α-dependence in both the prefactor and the exponent).  

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives an explicit, time-dependent expression that contains the extra factor  
(1+ (ħ t / m a²)²)^(-3/2) and an exponent with L² /(a²(1+…)), while Candidate 2 gives the generic Kijowski-type current  
(m L)/(ħ t²) |ψ̃(m L/t,0)|².  
Even for a Gaussian initial state, substituting |ψ̃|² into Candidate 2 does not reproduce the extra (1+ …)^(-3/2) factor that appears in Candidate 1. The two formulas therefore are not the same.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the bounds purely through the inelasticity parameter ηℓ:

σ_el = σ_in · (1 − η)/(1 + η)  to  σ_in · (1 + η)/(1 − η).

These bounds stay finite for every allowed η (0 ≤ η ≤ 1) and therefore for every allowed σ_in.

Candidate 2 rewrites the bounds with a constant
A = (2ℓ+1)π/k² and uses

(√A − √(A − σ_in))² ≤ σ_el ≤ (√A + √(A − σ_in))².

Here σ_in is compared with A, not with 4A.  
Because the physical maximum of σ_in for a partial wave is σ_in^max = 4A (obtained when η = 0), the square-root in Candidate 2 becomes imaginary as soon as σ_in > A. Hence Candidate 2 is not even defined over the full physical range, while Candidate 1 is.

Therefore the two sets of bounds cannot be the same; the answers are inequivalent.

The two candidates differ on several sub-parts:

• Parts (c)–(e): the contents and level of detail differ as well.

Since at least one required sub-answer (part (b)) is not identical, Rule 2 declares the overall answers inequivalent.

The question only asks for the θ-dependence of the differential cross section “up to a multiplicative constant.”  

• Candidate 1: (constant) × e^{-q²a²/2}.  
• Candidate 2: e^{-2a²k² sin²(θ/2)} = e^{-q²a²/2} (because q = 2k sin(θ/2)).  

Both candidates supply exactly the same θ-dependent factor, differing only by an overall constant that is irrelevant per the wording “up to a multiplicative constant.” Hence the two answers are equivalent.
Both candidates give the same dependence on the momentum-transfer (or scattering angle) via the factor  

 exp(−q²a² / 2).

The only difference is an overall prefactor (m²A²a⁶π)/(4ħ⁴) that is independent of q (and hence of θ).  
Because the problem explicitly asks for the result “up to a multiplicative constant,” such an overall θ-independent factor can be absorbed into that unspecified constant. Hence the two answers are equivalent for the purpose of the question.

Candidate 1 supplies one specific pair of coefficients that maximizes 〈x〉 (A = B = 1/√2) and one specific pair that minimizes 〈x〉 (A = –B = 1/√2).  
Candidate 2 supplies exactly the same pairs but explicitly adds the globally sign-flipped versions (overall ± in front of both coefficients). A common overall sign does not change the physical state or the value of 〈x〉, so these extra choices are not new, independent solutions—just the same solutions multiplied by an overall phase of –1.

Thus both candidates give the same essential information about which choices of A and B maximize and minimize 〈x〉.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The candidates give different sets of coefficient values.

• Candidate 1 lists only  
  – Maximum: A = B = 1/√2

• Candidate 2 lists  
  – Maximum: A = B = ±1/√2 (both positive or both negative)  
  – Minimum: A = ±1/√2, B = ∓1/√2 (opposite signs, either way)

Candidate 2 includes the additional solutions with the overall negative sign (A = B = –1/√2 for the maximum and A = –1/√2, B = +1/√2 for the minimum) that Candidate 1 omits. Hence the two answers are not identical, and per the rules they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the differential cross section in Born approximation in the form

σ(θ) ∝ V0² [sin(qR) − qR cos(qR)]² / q⁶ ,

with q = 2 k sin(θ/2).

The only explicit difference is that

• Candidate 1 writes the overall factor as 4 μ² / ħ⁴,  
• Candidate 2 writes it as 4 m² / ħ⁴.

For scattering of a light nucleon from a very heavy (fixed) target, the kinematics uses the nucleon mass; whether one denotes this mass by m or by the reduced mass μ makes no practical difference (μ ≃ m when the target mass M ≫ m). Hence, after identifying μ with m, the two formulas are identical.

Both candidates give the same overall formula.

1. Numerical prefactor  
   • Candidate 1: 2¹⁵ / 3¹⁰ = 32768 / 59049  
   • Candidate 2: explicit 32768 / 59049  
   They match.

2. Denominator frequency term  
   • Candidate 1: Γ² + ω₂₁²  
   • Candidate 2: Γ² + (3ħ / 8 m a₀²)²  

   For hydrogen, ω₂₁ = (E₂ – E₁)/ħ = 3 m e⁴ / 8 ħ³.  
   Since a₀ = ħ²/(m e²), one finds (3ħ / 8 m a₀²) = 3 m e⁴ / 8 ħ³ = ω₂₁.  
   Thus the frequency terms are identical.

3. All other factors (e² E₀² a₀²/ħ²) are written the same.

Therefore the two expressions are mathematically and physically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The numerical factors can be rewritten for direct comparison:

Candidate 1: P = (2¹⁵ / 3¹⁰) · (e² E₀² a₀²) / [ħ²(Γ² + ω₂₁²)]

     2¹⁵ = 32768  
     3¹⁰ = 59049  

 ⇒ P = (32768 / 59049) · (e² E₀² a₀²) / [ħ²(Γ² + ω₂₁²)]

Candidate 2: P = (32768 / 59049) · (e² E₀² a₀²) / [ħ²(Γ² + ω₂₁²)]

Both expressions are identical in every factor (numerical coefficient, physical constants, and denominator). Hence the two candidates are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question has three sub-parts.  
Both candidates give answers for all three, so we must compare each corresponding sub-answer.

(a) Rotational energy: both give  
 E_J = ħ² J(J+1)/(M D²).  
These are identical.

(b) Selection rule:  
 Candidate 1: ΔJ = ±1, Δm = 0.  
 Candidate 2: ΔJ = ±1 (no statement on Δm).  
The two answers are not identical; candidate 1 imposes an extra condition on Δm that candidate 2 does not mention. Hence they differ for this sub-problem.

(c) Emitted frequency:  
 Candidate 1: ω = 2Jħ/(M D²).  
 Candidate 2: ν = ħJ/(π M D²).  
Converting candidate 1 to ordinary frequency: ν = ω/(2π) = ħJ/(π M D²), which matches candidate 2. So part (c) is equivalent.

Because the answers differ in part (b), the overall responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give the same expression for (a) and, after accounting for ω = 2πν, their answers to (c) are equivalent.  
However, for (b) they differ:

• Candidate 2: ΔJ = −1 only.

The two candidates do not give the same set of results.  

• Candidate 2 explicitly lists the three lowest states (with quantum numbers and spins) and then writes two perturbative energy expressions that contain the direct term ± the exchange term; these correspond to the spatially antisymmetric (triplet) and symmetric (singlet) cases for the n = 1,2 configuration.  

• Candidate 1 only writes three symbols “ΔE” expressed as integrals of |ψ|²V with very little specification.  It does not spell out the direct ± exchange decomposition or even identify which integral belongs to the second- and third-lowest states required by the problem; it also omits the unperturbed energies and gives no classification of the three states.

Thus the answers are not the same set of predictions.
Candidate 1 does NOT give the required classification/spin of the three lowest states and does not present the same first-order energy shifts that Candidate 2 gives (the integrals have different integrands and Candidate 1 omits the base energies). Therefore the two sets of answers are not the same.

The question asks for three distinct pieces of information ((a), (b), and (c)).  
Both candidates supply answers for all three parts, so we compare each sub-answer.

(a) Eigenfunctions  
• Candidate 1: ψ(θ)=1/√(2π) e^{ikθ}  
• Candidate 2: ψ_n(φ)=1/√(2π) e^{inφ}  
These are the same function (different symbols only). → equivalent for (a).

(b) Ground-state occupancies  
• Candidate 1: “0^2 1^4 2^4 3^4 4^4” (2 electrons in n=0, 4 in n=±1, … ±4)  
• Candidate 2: explicit sentence with same counts. → equivalent for (b).

(c) Lowest excitation energy & wavelength  
• Candidate 1: ΔE = 9 ħ²/(2mr²); λ = 5800 Å (= 580 nm)  
• Candidate 2: ΔE = 2.14 eV; λ = 579 nm

Convert/compare: 9 ħ²/(2mr²) with r=4 Å evaluates to ≈2.15 eV, not exactly 2.14 eV; 580 nm vs 579 nm differ. Per Rule 4 the numerical answers must match to 6 significant digits; they do not. Hence (c) differs.

2. Degeneracy of each level.  
3. Corresponding eigenfunctions.

Candidate 1 supplies only items 1 and 3 (no degeneracy).  
Candidate 2 supplies all three items.

Even for the common parts (energy and wave-functions) the two answers differ:  
• Energy: Candidate 1 has a minus sign, Candidate 2 a plus sign.  
• Wave-function arguments differ in sign/shift as well.

Because one candidate omits a required component and their common components are not identical, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 2, plus mismatch in formulas).

b) ℏω₁ = 0.05 eV

• Candidate 2:  (n₊+½)ħ √[(k+ε)/m] + (n₋+½)ħ √[(k−ε)/m]

Since ω² = k/m, √(ω²±ε/m) = √[(k±ε)/m]; therefore the two formulae are identical (just different symbol names n′↔n₊, n↔n₋).

• Candidate 1:  ħω[(n′+n+1) + (ε/2k)(n′−n)]  
• Candidate 2:  ħω[(n₊+n₋+1) + (ε/2k)(n₊−n₋)]

Again, with ω = √(k/m) and the same correspondence of quantum numbers, the expressions coincide.

Units are consistent in both answers, and every required sub-answer is present in both. Hence the two candidate predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit expressions for ρ(η).

Candidate 1:
ρ₁(η) = √[ (a⁴/(16−2a⁴)) e^{2η}  / ( 1 + 2(a⁴/(16−2a⁴)) e^{2η} ) ]
  ⇒ ρ₁² = a⁴ e^{2η} / [ 2(8 − a⁴ + a⁴ e^{2η}) ]
  ⇒ ρ₁   = a² e^{η} / √[ 2(8 − a⁴ + a⁴ e^{2η}) ].

Candidate 2:
ρ₂(η) = a² / √[ 2(8 − a⁴ + a⁴ e^{−2η}) ].

Comparing the two denominators:

D₁ = 8 − a⁴ + a⁴ e^{2η},
D₂ = 8 − a⁴ + a⁴ e^{−2η}.

Except when η = 0 (or in very special parameter choices), D₁ ≠ D₂, so ρ₁(η) ≠ ρ₂(η) in general. A direct numerical check (e.g., a = 1, η = 1) also shows different values.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same mathematical expression up to notation:

• Candidate 1:  log((k+2)/(k+1)) – here TeX’s \log conventionally denotes the natural logarithm.

• Candidate 2:  ln((k+2)/(k+1)) – ln is explicitly the natural logarithm.

Since both represent the natural logarithm of (k+2)/(k+1), the two answers are equivalent.

The two candidates both give the value of the integral as

1 − (1/2) × logarithm of (2π).

Candidate 2 writes the logarithm explicitly as “ln”, i.e. the natural logarithm.  
Candidate 1 writes it as “log”. In the context of a real-analysis integral that involves the base-e exponential function, “log” is conventionally understood to mean the natural logarithm. Hence Candidate 1’s “log” and Candidate 2’s “ln” denote the same function, so the numerical values are identical.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the result

1 − (1/2) · log(2π)

where Candidate 1 writes “log” and Candidate 2 writes “ln”.  
In the context of mathematical analysis (definite integrals, special-function constants such as 2π), the symbol “log” is conventionally understood to denote the natural logarithm—the same function denoted explicitly by “ln”. Thus both expressions represent exactly the same quantity.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The two expressions are:

Candidate 1:  I = −(2/9) G − (π/6) ln 2  
Candidate 2:  I = −(2/3) G  

To be equivalent we would need
−(2/9) G − (π/6) ln 2 = −(2/3) G  
⇔ (π/6) ln 2 = (4/9) G.

Numerically,
(π/6) ln 2 ≈ 0.362931, (4/9) G ≈ 0.444426,  
which are not equal. Hence the two candidates give different values.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different symbolic expressions.

Candidate 1:  I = −(2/9) G − (π/6) ln 2  
Candidate 2:  I = −(2/3) G

They differ in two ways:
1. The coefficient of G is −2/9 versus −2/3 (not equal).
2. Candidate 1 includes an additional term −(π/6) ln 2 that Candidate 2 lacks.

There is no known identity that would make these two expressions identical, so they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same overall formula; the difference is only in how the common factor m! is distributed.

1. Candidate 1’s coefficient of ζ(k):  
   (-1)^k (2^k – 1)/2^{k-1}

2. Candidate 2’s coefficient of ζ(k):  
   (-1)^k (2 – 1/2^{k-1})

But (2^k – 1)/2^{k-1} = 2 – 1/2^{k-1}, so the coefficients coincide.  
Likewise, the –2 ln 2 term is multiplied by m! in both candidates (factored inside the brackets in Candidate 1, distributed in Candidate 2).

Hence the two expressions are exactly the same.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give

I(m)=m!\Bigl[-2\ln 2+\sum_{k=2}^{m+1}(-1)^k\bigl(2-2^{1-k}\bigr)\,\zeta(k)\Bigr].

• Candidate 1 writes the coefficient inside the sum as  
  (2^k-1)/2^{\,k-1}=2-1/2^{\,k-1}=2-2^{1-k}.

• Candidate 2 writes it as  
  2\bigl(1-1/2^{\,k}\bigr)=2-2/2^{\,k}=2-2^{1-k}.

Hence the two formulas are identical term-by-term (the prefactor m! and the −2 ln 2 term also coincide).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

The two expressions are clearly different.

• Candidate 1: 2 ψ(½) – ψ(½ + i a/π) – ψ(½ – i a/π)

• Candidate 2: ψ(a/(2π) + ½) – ψ(a/(2π))

They involve the digamma function evaluated at entirely different arguments:  
– Candidate 1 uses complex-conjugate points ½ ± i a/π and includes an extra constant term 2 ψ(½).  
– Candidate 2 uses purely real points a/(2π)+½ and a/(2π), and has no constant offset.

Substituting a = 0 already shows inequivalence:  
Candidate 1 → 0, while Candidate 2 → ψ(½) – ψ(0), which is divergent.  
Thus the two formulas cannot be equal for general a.

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give clearly different analytic expressions:

Candidate 1: 2 ψ(½) – ψ(½ + i a/π) – ψ(½ – i a/π)

Candidate 2: ψ(½ + a/2) – ψ(½)

Candidate 1 involves the digamma function evaluated at complex conjugate points ½ ± i a/π, while Candidate 2 involves the digamma function at the real point ½ + a/2. Except for the trivial case a = 0 (where both reduce to 0), these expressions are not the same function of a; no standard identity converts one into the other. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both expressions can be rewritten in the same trigonometric form:

Candidate 1:  
π (1 − πk cot πk) csc πk  
 = π [1 − πk cos(πk)/sin(πk)] · 1/sin(πk)  
 = π [sin(πk) − πk cos(πk)] / sin²(πk)

Candidate 2 is already  
π [sin(πk) − πk cos(πk)] / sin²(πk)

Since the two expressions are identical after simplification, the candidates are equivalent.

The value Cin(2π) is defined as 

Cin(2π) = ∫₀^{2π} (1 − cos t)/t dt ,

and this function increases to its limiting value π/2 as 2π → ∞.  
Hence 0 < Cin(2π) < π/2, so

Cin(2π)/2 < (π/2)/2 = π/4 ≈ 0.785398.

Candidate 1 gives Cin(2π)/2 (a number below π/4), whereas Candidate 2 gives π/2 ≈ 1.570796.  
Since these two numerical values are obviously different, the candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives

Candidate 2 gives  
 2π J₀(b √(a²+k²)).

The functions e^{−i z}/z and J₀(z) are not the same (e.g., at z=0, J₀(0)=1 while e^{−i 0}/0 is undefined). Hence the two answers are mathematically different.

Both candidates give the same mathematical expression up to notation:  
• Candidate 1: log(2 + i)  
• Candidate 2: ln(2 + i)

In standard mathematical usage—especially in contexts involving complex analysis—“log” without a base almost always denotes the natural logarithm, the same function denoted by “ln”. Since neither the problem nor either answer introduces any alternative base, there is no reasonable ambiguity, and the two notations represent the same value.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the answer as the logarithm of the complex number 2 + i.  
Candidate 2 explicitly uses “ln”, which unambiguously means the natural logarithm.  
Candidate 1 writes “log”; in the usual mathematical context of complex analysis (where this integral lives), “log” is taken to be the natural logarithm unless another base is specified. Thus both expressions denote the same value, namely the natural logarithm of 2 + i.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions:

• Candidate 1: π (c − √(c² − a²))

• Candidate 2: π a

To check equivalence, set them equal and test algebraically:

π (c − √(c² − a²)) = π a  
⇒ c − √(c² − a²) = a  
⇒ √(c² − a²) = c − a  
⇒ c² − a² = (c − a)² = c² − 2ac + a²  
⇒ −a² = −2ac + a²  
⇒ 2a(c − a) = 0.

Because a > 0 and c > a, the factor (c − a) ≠ 0, so the equality cannot hold. Therefore the two expressions are not the same for the allowed parameter range.

These two expressions are not identically equal for the allowed parameters (positive a, b, c with b > c > a). For example, taking a = 3 and c = 5 produces π (5 − 4) = π, whereas π a = 3π. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives a formula that still contains the free variable n:

π · ( C(2n, n) ) / 2²ⁿ.

Because Candidate 2’s result depends on an unspecified n, while Candidate 1 produces a fixed constant, the two answers cannot be the same value (Rule 6 “type mismatch” and Rule 8 “lazy reasoning”). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives a one-parameter family of expressions:

Because Candidate 2 depends on an unspecified variable n, it does not represent a single fixed value, whereas Candidate 1 does. Hence the two answers are not the same object and cannot be equivalent.

Since eᵡ > 0 for all real x, the fraction (1+eᵡ)/(2+eᵡ) is always positive. Therefore |(1+eᵡ)/(2+eᵡ)| = (1+eᵡ)/(2+eᵡ), so ln|…| equals ln(…) on the entire domain of the integral.

The question asks for a single value of the limit.  

• Candidate 1 states the limit could be “± 1,” i.e., either 1 or −1.

  7/16 · ζ(3)  −  (π²/12) ln 2.

• Candidate 1 is a long expression containing explicit imaginary terms (i π³, i π …), many additional logarithms and polylogarithms, and a different coefficient of ζ(3).  There is no obvious cancellation that would remove all the imaginary parts or reduce it to the concise real expression of Candidate 2.

Because the two expressions are not the same (they do not match numerically or symbolically, and Candidate 1 even appears complex while the integral’s value is real), the answers are not equivalent.

The question requests two explicit values, I₀ and I₁.  
Both candidates supply expressions for both quantities, so we compare each pair:

1. I₀  
   • Candidate 1: I₀ = L(χ₋₃, 2)  
   • Candidate 2: I₀ = L(χ₋₃, 2)  
   → identical.

2. I₁  
   • Candidate 1: I₁ = 3 L(χ₋₃, 2) − 2  
   • Candidate 2: I₁ = 2 L(χ₋₃, 2)  
   → not identical unless 3 L − 2 = 2 L, which would require L = 2, but L(χ₋₃, 2) is a fixed constant ≠ 2. Hence the two expressions differ.

Because at least one of the required sub-answers (I₁) is different, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The problem asks for two separate quantities, I₀ and I₁.  
Both candidates supply explicit formulas for each.

• For I₀:  
 Candidate 1: I₀ = L(χ₋₃,2)  
 Candidate 2: I₀ = L(χ₋₃,2)  
 These are identical.

• For I₁:  
 Candidate 1: I₁ = 3 L(χ₋₃,2) – 2  
 Candidate 2: I₁ = L(χ₋₃,2)

Unless 3 L(χ₋₃,2) – 2 equals L(χ₋₃,2), which would require L(χ₋₃,2) = 1 (it is actually ≈0.949), the two expressions for I₁ are different. Therefore the two candidates give different answers for at least one required quantity.

Hence, the candidates are not equivalent.
The problem asks for two specific quantities, I₀ and I₁.  
Both candidates give values for both quantities, but they differ on the value of I₁:

• I₁ (Candidate 1) = 3 L(χ₋₃, 2) – 2  
• I₁ (Candidate 2) = L(χ₋₃, 2)

Because at least one of the required answers is different, the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1  
l(r)=−∫_{r}^{∞}dr₂∫_{0}^{r₂}(r₁/r₂)^{d−1}s(r₁)dr₁.

Candidate 2  
l(r)=− 1/(d−2) [ r^{−(d−2)}∫_{0}^{r} r'^{d−1}s(r')dr' + ∫_{r}^{∞} r' s(r')dr' ].

Re-ordering the integrations in Candidate 1 and performing the r₂–integral:

∫_{max(r,r₁)}^{∞}(r₁/r₂)^{d−1}dr₂ = r₁^{d−1}/(d−2)·[max(r,r₁)]^{−(d−2)}.

Splitting at r gives exactly the two terms in Candidate 2, with the same prefactor −1/(d−2). Hence, for d≠2 (the usual case in which the Newtonian Green’s function is 1/r^{d−2}), the two formulas coincide.  
Therefore, the answers are mathematically equivalent (up to the expected separate treatment when d=2).

The two expressions agree when d ≠ 2 (they can be shown to differ only by an integration by parts factor 1/(2 − d)), but Candidate 2 becomes undefined at d = 2 whereas Candidate 1 remains well-defined.

2.  Coefficient of Li₅(½):
   • Candidate 1: +24 Li₅(½).  
   • Candidate 2: −24 Li₅(½).

3.  ζ(5) term:
   • Candidate 1: (3/5) ζ(5).  
   • Candidate 2: 24 ζ(5).

4.  Many constants (−120, 6π², π⁴/30, …) appear in Candidate 1 but have no counterparts in Candidate 2, while Candidate 2 contains combinations like −8 ζ(2)(ln 2)³ that differ from Candidate 1’s corresponding coefficients.

Because of these substantial, uncompensated differences, the two expressions cannot be algebraically identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates present very different combinations of constants:

1. The coefficients of Li₅(½) differ in sign (+24 in Candidate 1 vs −24 in Candidate 2).
2. Candidate 1 contains a plain Li₄(½) term, whereas Candidate 2 contains Li₄(½) multiplied by ln 2.
3. Several other coefficients (e.g. those of ln²2 ζ(3), ln⁵2, ζ(5)) are not the same even after substituting ζ(2)=π²/6.
4. Candidate 1 includes many extra lower-weight constants (−120, 6π², etc.) that have no counterparts in Candidate 2.

Because these expressions cannot be reconciled into one another through standard identities, the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give very different combinations of constants.

• Candidate 1 contains a bare term +24 Li₄(½) while Candidate 2 contains +24 Li₄(½) ln 2 instead; no other terms in Candidate 1 supply an extra ln 2 factor that could convert one into the other.

• Candidate 1 has +24 Li₅(½) (positive) whereas Candidate 2 has −24 Li₅(½) (negative).

• Candidate 1 has many additional constants (−120, 6π², π⁴/30, etc.) that do not appear in Candidate 2, while Candidate 2 has −48 ζ(5), which is absent from Candidate 1 (Candidate 1 has +(3/5) ζ(5) instead).

Given these clear coefficient and sign mismatches, no algebraic identities can reconcile the two expressions; they are not the same formula.

The two candidates give different expressions:

• Candidate 1: arccos ( − b / √(1 + a² + b²) ) — depends on both a and b.  
• Candidate 2: π / 2 — a constant, independent of a and b.

These are equal only in special cases (e.g., when b = 0), but not in general for arbitrary real a and b as the question requires. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different expressions:

Candidate 1:  arccos ( – b / √(1 + a² + b²) ), which depends on a and b.

Candidate 2:  π / 2, a constant independent of a and b.

These two results agree only when – b / √(1 + a² + b²) = 0, i.e. when b = 0; for general (a, b) they are not equal. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different overall multiplicative factors in front of the same beta and harmonic-number combination.

• Candidate 1 multiplies β(1 − a, 1 + 2a) H_a by (1/2)(1 + 1/a) = (a + 1)/(2a).

• Candidate 2 multiplies β(1 − a, 2a + 1) H_a (the same beta function) by 1.

These two expressions coincide only in the special case a = 1; for general a they are different. Hence the answers are not equivalent.
The two expressions to be compared are

Candidate 1: I₁ = ½ β(1−a, 1+2a) (1+1/a) Hₐ  
Candidate 2: I₂ = 2^{−2a} β(a, a) Hₐ

Because Hₐ is a common factor, the question reduces to whether

½ β(1−a, 1+2a) (1+1/a)  
equals  
2^{−2a} β(a, a).

Using β(x,y)=Γ(x)Γ(y)/Γ(x+y) and standard Γ–identities one finds

½ β(1−a, 1+2a) (1+1/a) = Γ(1−a) Γ(2a)/(a Γ(a)),  
whereas  
2^{−2a} β(a, a) = 2^{−2a} Γ(a)^2/Γ(2a).

These two expressions are generally not equal (e.g. for a = ½ they differ by a factor ≈1.27). Hence the candidates produce different results.

According to the comparison rules, unequal mathematical expressions mean the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates yield clearly different expressions:

Candidate 1: I = ½ β(1 − a, 1 + 2a) (1 + 1/a) Hₐ  
Candidate 2: I = β(a + 1, a + 1) Hₐ

These beta-function factors are not identical in general (e.g., for a = 0.5 they differ by about a factor of 5). Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
I(s,t) = 2 √[(Σ t_i)/(∏ s_i)] · K₁( 2 √[(Σ t_i)(∏ s_i)] ).

Candidate 2 gives  
I(s,t) = ∏_{i=1}^n [ 2 √(t_i/s_i) · K₁( 2 √(s_i t_i) ) ].

For n ≥ 2 these two expressions have completely different dependences on the sets {t_i} and {s_i}:  
• Candidate 1 contains the single combination Σ t_i and the single combination ∏ s_i.  
• Candidate 2 is a product of n separate factors, each involving only t_i and s_i individually.

They coincide only in the degenerate case n = 1; for general n they are not equal. Hence, under the problem statement (which allows any n), the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two formulas differ in structure:

• Candidate 1 compresses all variables into the single combination  
  2 √[(Σ t_i)/(∏ s_i)] K₁(2√[(Σ t_i)(∏ s_i)]).

• Candidate 2 is the product of n separate factors  
  ∏_{i=1}^n [2 √(t_i/s_i) K₁(2√(s_i t_i))].

For n = 1 they coincide, but for n > 1 no known Bessel-function identity makes the product in Candidate 2 collapse to the single factor in Candidate 1. Hence the expressions are generally different.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different functional forms:

  2ⁿ ∏_{i=1}^n [√(t_i/s_i) K₁(2√(s_i t_i))].

For n ≥ 2 these expressions cannot, in general, be the same (they depend on the variables in different combined ways). They coincide only in the special case n = 1, but the question concerns arbitrary n. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 equals twice the first term of Candidate 1 and contains no infinite series.

Σ_{n=0}^{∞} (−1)^{n+1} e^{−α(n+1/2)} / ((n+1/2)^2 − β^2) = π e^{−αβ}/(2β cos πβ),

which is not generally true (it fails already when α→0, as a direct numerical check for a sample β shows). Therefore the two proposed results are not the same.

Candidate 1 contains an extra infinite series and only half of the prefactor in its first term, whereas Candidate 2 consists solely of the prefactor term (with coefficient twice as large) and no series.

The two candidates give very different looking closed-form formulas.

To make them represent the same numerical constant, every power of ln 2 occurring in Candidate 1 would have to disappear once the known identity for Li₅(½) is substituted.  The standard expansion  

Li₅(½)=a ζ₅ + b π² ζ₃ + c π⁴ ln 2 + d ζ₃ ln²2 + e π² ln³2 + f ln⁵2  

has non-zero coefficients d, e, f.  After multiplying by 5/2 (the factor present in Candidate 1) the terms in ln²2, ln³2, ln⁵2 remain, and they do not cancel the explicit ln-terms already present in Candidate 1.  Consequently Candidate 1 retains logarithmic terms, whereas Candidate 2 contains none.  Because no known identities relate powers of ln 2 to pure zeta values, the two expressions cannot be equal.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two expressions are structurally very different:  

• Candidate 1 contains several logarithmic terms and the polylogarithm value Li₅(½);  
• Candidate 2 involves only powers of π multiplied by zeta–values.

Even after using known identities (ζ(2)=π²/6, ζ(4)=π⁴/90, and the standard expansion of Li₅(½) in terms of zeta-values and powers of log 2), the coefficients in Candidate 1 do not match those in Candidate 2. A quick numerical evaluation confirms this:

 Candidate 1 ≈ 1.16  
 Candidate 2 ≈ 3.94  

They are clearly not equal to 6 significant digits. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2  
S₂ ≈ Γ(¼)⁴/(16π²) + 4 ln 2/π ≈ 1.98

Since the evaluated values differ and there is no known identity making the two symbolic forms equal, the candidates are inequivalent.

Rewriting S₁ = Γ(¼)⁴/(16 π) − 3 Γ(¼)⁴ ln 2/(16 π²), whereas S₂ = 4 ln 2/π + Γ(¼)⁴/(8 π²).  
Setting them equal would require

Γ(¼)⁴(π − 2 − 3 ln 2) = 64 π ln 2,

which is not true. Numerical evaluation confirms S₁ ≈ 1.16 and S₂ ≈ 3.07. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
 i π ln²2 + Li₃(2),

while Candidate 2 gives  
 Li₃(½) + (π²/6) ln 2 + (ln³2)/6 – (7/8) ζ(3).

Using standard functional relations for the trilogarithm one finds  
 Li₃(2) = –(ln³2)/4 + (π²/4) ln 2 + (7/8) ζ(3) – i (π/2) ln²2,

 Li₃(½) =  (ln³2)/12 – (π²/12) ln 2 + (1/2) ζ(3) – (1/2) Li₃(–1).

Substituting these values shows:

• Candidate 1 simplifies to (real part) –(ln³2)/4 + (π²/4) ln 2 + (7/8) ζ(3) plus an
  imaginary part i (π/2) ln²2 (so it is complex).

• Candidate 2 simplifies to (ln³2)/4 + (π²/12) ln 2, a purely real number.

Thus the two expressions differ both in their real parts and because Candidate 1 retains a non-zero imaginary part whereas Candidate 2 is real. Hence they are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different symbolic expressions.  
Candidate 1 contains an explicit imaginary term \(i\pi\ln^{2}2\), whereas Candidate 2 is purely real.  For the two candidates to be equivalent, that imaginary part would have to cancel with the (implicit) imaginary part of \(\operatorname{Li}_3(2)\), and the remaining real parts would then have to match the real-valued expression in Candidate 2. Numerical and analytic checks show this is not the case; the resulting values differ.

Candidate 1 presents the value as 
  −2 π e^{−b c} cos(r c).

Candidate 2 presents the value as 
  Im [ e^{−(b−ir) c} E₁(−(b−ir) c) ].

These are manifestly different mathematical expressions.  For instance, setting r = 0 gives Candidate 1 = −2 π e^{−b c}, while Candidate 2 becomes Im[ e^{−b c} E₁(−b c) ], which is generally not equal to −2 π e^{−b c}. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give fundamentally different expressions:

Candidate 1:  −2 π e^(−b c) cos(r c)

Candidate 2:  [ e^(−c(b−ir)) E₁(−c(b−ir)) − e^(−c(b+ir)) E₁(−c(b+ir)) ] / (2 i)

The second answer contains the exponential-integral function E₁, while the first is a simple elementary function. There is no general identity that reduces the E₁ expression to the elementary one for arbitrary complex c with Re(c)>0, Im(c)<0 and real b,r>0. Hence the two results are not the same.

Both candidates give the product of the same two factors, merely in reversed order:

Candidate 1: (1 − cos r) · cos r  
Candidate 2: cos r · (1 − cos r)

Multiplication is commutative, so the two expressions are identical for every r. Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The two expressions differ in several essential factors:

1. Candidate 1 contains the factor cos(πa) whereas Candidate 2 contains Γ(b).  
2. The denominators are different: (s − k + 1)^a in Candidate 1 vs (k − s − 1)^a in Candidate 2.  Even after noting that s − k + 1 = −(k − s − 1), the resulting phase factor (−1)^{−a} does not match the cos(πa) factor, nor does it supply the missing Γ(b).  
3. Candidate 1 lacks the Γ(b) factor entirely.

Because of these discrepancies, the two candidates are not mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different expressions:

Candidate 1: cos(πa)·(s − k + 1)^{−a}·(k − s)^{a−b}

Candidate 2: Γ(b)·(k − s)^{a−b}/(k − s − 1)^a

They differ by the overall factors cos(πa) vs Γ(b) and by a possible (−1)^{−a} sign coming from (s−k+1) vs (k−s−1). Because these expressions are not generally equal, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives  
I₁ = cos(πa) (s-k+1)^{-a}(k-s)^{a-b}.

Rewrite the power of (s-k+1):

s-k+1 = –(k-s-1)  ⇒  (s-k+1)^{-a} = (–1)^{-a}(k-s-1)^{-a}.

Thus  

I₁ = cos(πa)(–1)^{-a}(k-s)^{a-b}(k-s-1)^{-a}  
   = cos(πa)e^{-iπa}(k-s)^{-(b-a)}(k-s-1)^{-a}.

Candidate 2 gives  
I₂ = Γ(b)(k-s)^{-(b-a)}(k-s-1)^{-a}.

Apart from the common factor (k-s)^{-(b-a)}(k-s-1)^{-a}, the two answers differ:  
I₁ has the factor cos(πa)e^{-iπa}, whereas I₂ has Γ(b).

Since cos(πa)e^{-iπa} is not identically equal to Γ(b) for general a,b, the two results are not the same.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Unless one explicitly assumes Δ ≥ 0, these are not identical; for negative Δ the two expressions give different results. The problem statement does not guarantee that Δ is restricted to be positive, so the answers cannot be considered universally equivalent.

The two expressions are not the same.

1. Factor in front:
   • Candidate 1:  (√π / T^{3/2})  
   • Candidate 2:  2 √π / T^{3/2}  
   ⇒ Candidate 2 is larger by a factor 2.

2. Phase factor:
   • Candidate 1 carries exp[i((√a+√b)²/T + π/4)].  
   • Candidate 2 carries exp[i((√a+√b)²/T − π/4)].  
   ⇒ The phases differ by exp(i π/2) = i.

Combining, I₁ = (i/2) I₂ (up to the sign choice of √i, which can at most flip a sign but cannot remove both the factor 2 and the factor i). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers have the same prefactor except for a factor e^{i\pi/4}.  
Their exponential phases differ more substantially:

• Candidate 1 phase: i[(√a+√b)²/T + π/4]  
• Candidate 2 phase: i[(√a−√b)²/T − π/4]

The difference between the two total phases is  
i[(√a+√b)² − (√a−√b)²]/T + iπ/2 = i(4√a√b/T + π/2),

which is not an integer multiple of 2π for arbitrary positive a, b, T. Hence the two expressions are generally different.

• Candidate 2  
 g(x)=2 ln 2 – 2√2 √π x + 4x² + … (quadratic coefficient = 4)

Reasoning:

To decide whether the two candidates are equivalent we need to check whether, for every positive b,  

 Candidate 1: I₂(0,b)=½ – (1/π)·arctan[ b / √(2+b²) ]  

 Candidate 2: I₂(0,b)=¼ + (1/2π)·arcsin[ 1 / (1+b²) ]  

give the same value.

Multiply both sides of Candidate 1 by π and compare with Candidate 2:

(π/2) – arctan( b / √(2+b²) ) vs (π/4) + ½·arcsin( 1/(1+b²) ).

Re-arranging gives the condition

arcsin( 1/(1+b²) ) + 2·arctan( b / √(2+b²) ) = π/2.

Testing several positive b (e.g. b=0.5, 1, 2) confirms this identity numerically to high precision, and it follows from the standard trigonometric identity
arcsin x = π/2 – 2·arctan(√[(1–x)/(1+x)]), with x=1/(1+b²).

Since the relation holds for all b>0, the two expressions are identical, so both candidates give the same function.

The two candidates give completely different analytic expressions for the same single integral.  

•  Candidate 1 contains a sum over m with incomplete-gamma functions and a hypergeometric function whose argument is 1 – b²/a².  
•  Candidate 2 is a simple closed-form factor (π/2) b e^(–b) multiplied by ₂F₁(½,½;1; a²/b²).

There is no straightforward identity that converts one formula into the other, and testing special cases (e.g. letting a→0) shows the two expressions yield different numerical values. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give completely different closed-form expressions for the same integral:

• Candidate 1:  I = e^{-b} + (1/2)(b²−a²) ∑_{m=0}^{∞} a^{2m} Γ(−1−2m,b) {}_2F_1(−m,3/2;2;1−b²/a²)

• Candidate 2:  I = (π/2) b e^{-b} {}_2F_1(½,½;1;a²/b²)

A numerical check (e.g. a=1, b=2) shows Candidate 1’s series matches a value ≈0.26, whereas Candidate 2 yields ≈0.46, so the two formulas are not equal. Thus the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers must give exactly the same set of convergent initial values and the same correspondence of limits.

Candidate 2 says:  
• “all real pre-images of 1 and –2 under f and its iterates.”  
That means every number that lands on 1 or –2 after finitely many iterations.

Candidate 1 says:  
• “a₀ can be written as ±√(2 ± √(2 ± √(2 ± … ± √2)))”.  
This produces only nested square-root expressions that contain the constant 2 in every radicand.  
Numbers such as ±1, which are pre-images of 1, cannot be written in that form, yet Candidate 1 simultaneously lists ±1 among the convergent starting values. Hence the verbal criterion (“iff it can be written …”) and the accompanying lists do not match Candidate 2’s description of “all pre-images”.

Therefore the two candidates are not describing identical sets, nor do they give identical conditions for the limits.

Both answers consist of single (real-valued) expressions that are supposed to equal the same definite integral.  
To see whether they are equivalent we compare the two expressions.

Candidate 1  
  I₁ = 512 Im Li₄((1+i)/2) + (8π/3) ln²2·ln2 + 6π³ ln2 – 384 β(4).

Candidate 2  
  I₂ = 7π β(4) – π⁵/24 – 4π ζ(3) ln2.

Numeric check (with standard high-precision constants)

• Im Li₄((1+i)/2) ≈ 0.5340224  
  ⇒ 512 Im Li₄((1+i)/2) ≈ 273.4195

• (8π/3) ln²2 ln2 ≈ 2.78994  
• 6π³ ln2 ≈ 128.95148  
• –384 β(4)  (β(4)≈0.988945) ≈ –379.75471  

Sum for Candidate 1: 273.4195 + 2.78994 + 128.95148 – 379.75471 ≈ 25.4062

For Candidate 2

• 7π β(4) ≈ 21.7480  
• –π⁵/24 (π⁵≈306.0199) ≈ –12.7508  
• –4π ζ(3) ln2 (ζ(3)≈1.2020569) ≈ –10.4703  

Sum for Candidate 2: 21.7480 – 12.7508 – 10.4703 ≈ –1.4731

Both answers present symbolic formulas for the same integral.  

• Candidate 2’s expression is purely real.  
• Candidate 1’s expression contains an explicit “ i ” (−π i ⋯) giving a non-zero imaginary part (since all other factors are real and non-zero for n≥0), so the result is complex.  

Because one result is complex and the other purely real, they cannot be the same. Thus the two predictions are not equivalent.
The two formulas are structurally different:

1. Candidate 1 contains an explicit imaginary term proportional to π i, while Candidate 2 is purely real.  
2. Even disregarding the imaginary part, the real coefficients multiplying ζ′(n+1) and Γ′(n+1) differ by factors of 2^{n+1}.  
3. Candidate 1 has factors involving (1 − (−1)^n), hence it vanishes for even n in some parts, whereas Candidate 2 has no such parity dependence.

Because of these differences, the two expressions cannot be the same for all n.

• Candidate 2 is
  (-1)^n / 2^{n+1} · (d^{\,n+1}/ds^{\,n+1})[Γ(s)ζ(s)] evaluated at s=1,
i.e. a single (n+1)-th derivative of the product Γζ at s=1, with no π i factor or the separate Γ′, ζ′ terms seen in Candidate 1.

Because the functional forms, the evaluation points (s=1 in Candidate 2 vs arguments n+1 in Candidate 1), and even the presence of an imaginary unit differ, the two answers cannot be the same expression.

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Because Li₄(½) is linearly independent of the other constants in the list, a difference in its explicit coefficient cannot be compensated by the remaining terms. Hence the two formulas cannot be the same.

Moreover, Candidate 1 contains the extra term  −(7/4) ζ(3) ln 2, which has no counterpart in Candidate 2.

Therefore the two candidates give different results.

The two proposed expressions are not the same.

1. The first expression contains the term “−Ei(0)”, while the second contains “ln A”.  Since Ei(0) (the exponential integral at 0) tends to −∞, “−Ei(0)” would diverge to +∞; it cannot equal the finite value “ln A” for arbitrary positive A.

2. The arguments fed into the generalized Wright function differ:
   • Candidate 1 uses  B / (A−1)^{c}  (positive).
   • Candidate 2 uses –B / A^{c}  (negative in sign and with a different denominator).

Because both the non-Wright terms and the Wright-function arguments disagree, the two answers represent different formulas and are therefore inequivalent.
The two candidates give clearly different analytical expressions:

1. Their first terms differ:
   • Candidate 1:  −Ei(0)  
   • Candidate 2:  ln A  

   −Ei(0) (which is undefined or −∞ in the usual principal‐value sense) is not the same as ln A (a finite number for A > 0).

2. Their generalized Wright function parts differ in both the type of Wright function and its argument:
   • Candidate 1 uses  _1Ψ_0[…] with argument  B/(A−1)^c.  
   • Candidate 2 uses  _1Ψ_1[…] with argument  −B/A^c.  

   These are distinct functions with different parameters and different arguments, so they cannot be equivalent.

Because both the prefactors and the special-function terms do not match, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers give completely different expressions:

Candidate 1:  −Ei(0) − {}_1Ψ_0[(0,c); B/(A−1)^c]

Candidate 2:  ln A − {}_1Ψ_0[(0,c); −B/A^c]

1. −Ei(0) is not equal to ln A (Ei(0) has a logarithmic singularity).
2. The arguments of the generalized Wright functions differ both in sign and in the factor (A−1)^c vs A^c.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two expressions are structurally different:  

1. Candidate 1 lacks the explicit “ln A” term that appears in Candidate 2 (−Ei(0)=0 does not supply it).  
2. The arguments supplied to the generalized Wright function differ: Candidate 1 uses B/(A−1)^c, while Candidate 2 uses −B/A^c.

Because of these discrepancies, the two answers cannot be the same.
The two candidate expressions are not equivalent.

Reasons:
1.  The coefficients of Li₄(½) differ drastically (16 π vs. π/2).  
2.  Even after substituting the known relation for Li₄(½) in terms of π, ln 2, and ζ(3), the resulting π⁵ coefficients differ (candidate 1 gives 23/360 π⁵ after combination, whereas candidate 2 gives 1/192 π⁵).  
3.  Other coefficients (e.g., for ln³2) also disagree.

Hence the two proposed closed-form values are not identical.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different numerical coefficients for every constant ( Li₄(½), ζ(3) log 2, ( log 2 )², ( log 2 )⁴, π⁵ ).  
For example:

• Li₄(½) term: 16 π (Candidate 1) vs π/2 (Candidate 2)  
• ζ(3) log 2 term: 5 π (Candidate 1) vs 7π/16 (Candidate 2)

Because the coefficients disagree, the expressions cannot be equal.
The two candidates give different closed-form expressions, and when evaluated numerically with high‐precision values for  
π, log 2, ζ(3) and Li₄(½) they do not match:

• Candidate 1  ≈ 1.210324  
• Candidate 2  ≈ 1.237586  

The difference (~2.7 × 10⁻²) is far beyond numerical round-off error. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both answers give the same formula on the relevant domain:

• Inside the strip u∈[0,1] they both equal  
 f_{X,Y}(F_X^{*-1}(u),y) / f_X(F_X^{*-1}(u)).

• Candidate 1 multiplies by 1_{[0,1]}(u), thus explicitly declaring the density is zero outside [0,1].  
  Candidate 2 omits this indicator but the question already restricts the space to [0,1]×ℝ, so outside that set the density is irrelevant.

Hence the two candidates describe the same density; the indicator function in Candidate 1 does not change the value on the prescribed domain and merely makes the zero-extension explicit.

The two expressions differ in the exponential factor that multiplies the second complementary-error-function term.

• Candidate 1’s exponential factor: exp[ k(z + a k t) ] = exp( k z + a k² t )

• Candidate 2’s exponential factor: exp[ k z + a k t² ]

Because a k² t ≠ a k t² for general positive a, k, t, the two results cannot be the same except in special, non-general situations (e.g., t = k or t = 0, which is ruled out). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both expressions are related by the identity

  ∑_{k=1}^{m} H_k / k = ½ (H_m² + H_m^{(2)}),

so

         = (2/m)·½ (H_m² + H_m^{(2)})
         = (H_m² + H_m^{(2)})/m

Both candidates give single numerical expressions for the same integral, so we can compare the results directly (Rule 4).

Numerical evaluation (to 6 significant digits):

• Candidate 1  
 I₁ ≈ 1.21055

• Candidate 2  
 I₂ ≈ 2.51639

The two values differ well beyond 6 significant digits, so the predictions are not the same.

The two expressions are clearly different.

• Candidate 1: a long combination involving π, ζ(3), ln 2, ln² 2, ln⁴ 2, π³, π⁵ and Li₄(½).

• Candidate 2: only (7π/8) ζ(3).

There is no way the many extra terms in Candidate 1 (including factors of ln 2 and Li₄(½)) can cancel to leave exactly (7π/8) ζ(3). Hence the two results are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives

Candidate 2 gives  
\big(2/((2m-1)\pi)\big)^{k}=2^{k}/\big((2m-1)^{k}\pi^{k}\big)

These two expressions differ in both numerator and denominator—they are not algebraically identical for general m and k (e.g., take k = 1, m = 1 to see different numerical values). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give clearly different expressions.

For generic m, k:
Candidate 1 = 2^{k-3} [(2m+1)^{k+2} − (2m−1)^{k+2}]  /  [m ((4m²−1)π)^k]

Candidate 2 = (2/((2m−1)π))^k = 2^k / [(2m−1)^k π^k]

They are not algebraically the same. A quick test with k = 1, m = 1 gives
 Cand 1 ≈ 1.0833/π, Cand 2 = 2/π,
showing they differ.

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives
          2^{k-3} [(2m+1)^{k+2} – (2m–1)^{k+2}]
   L₁ = ------------------------------------------
          m [(4m² – 1) π]^{k}

Candidate 2 gives
          2^{k}
   L₂ = ------------- .
        [(2m – 1) π]^{k}

Already for m = 1 we have  

L₂ = (2/π)^{k}  

L₁ = 2^{k-3} (3^{k+2} – 1) / (3^{k} π^{k})
    = (1/8)(9 – 3^{–k})(2/π)^{k} .

The factor (1/8)(9 – 3^{–k}) differs from 1 for any k ≥ 1, so L₁ ≠ L₂.  
Since they are not equal even for this single choice of m and k, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
Re Ψ(½ + ħω / (2π i k_B T)) − ln(ħω / k_B T).

Candidate 2 gives  
½ [ Re ψ(½ + ħω / (4π k_B T)) − ln(ħω / (4π k_B T)) ].

The two formulas differ in three independent ways:

1. An overall factor of ½ is present in Candidate 2 but not in Candidate 1.  
2. The argument of the digamma function differs: ½ + ħω/(2π i k_B T) (imaginary shift) vs ½ + ħω/(4π k_B T) (real shift).  
3. The logarithm’s argument differs by a factor 4π and the presence/absence of i, so even after simplifications they cannot coincide.

Because of these discrepancies, the two expressions are not mathematically the same.
Candidate 1 gives  
Re Ψ(½ + ħω / (2π i k_BT)) − ln(ħω / k_BT).

Candidate 2 gives  
Re Ψ(½ + i ħω / (2π k_BT)) + ln(2π k_BT / ħω).

• The digamma arguments differ only by complex conjugation (±i …); the real part is the same, so that part is equivalent.

• For the logarithmic part:  
ln(2π k_BT / ħω) = −ln(ħω / k_BT) + ln 2π.

Thus Candidate 2’s entire expression equals Candidate 1’s plus an extra constant term ln 2π.  
Since ln 2π ≠ 0, the two answers are not identical.

The two candidates give different functional forms:

Candidate 1:  Re Ψ(½ + ħω / (2π i k_B T)) − ln(ħω / k_B T)

• argument of Ψ contains an imaginary part (i)  
• no overall factor ½ in front of Re Ψ  
• logarithm lacks the ½ factor and the 4π inside the log that appear in candidate 2.

Candidate 2:  ½ Re Ψ(½ + ħω / (4π k_B T)) − ½ ln(ħω / (4π k_B T))

• argument of Ψ is purely real (no i) and has a denominator 4π instead of 2π  
• overall factor ½ multiplies both the Re Ψ and the log term.

Because of these structural differences (presence/absence of i, different coefficients, and different logarithmic arguments), the two expressions cannot be identical for all ω and T. Thus the candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 contains the factor R^{2l+1}.  
• Candidate 2 contains the factor R^{l+1}.  
For l = 2 (an allowed even integer), Candidate 1 gives a factor of R^{5} while Candidate 2 gives R^{3}, so they cannot be the same expression in general.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two proposed formulas are not the same.

Reasoning summary:

1.  Candidate 1 is manifestly real for every positive real n, as it is a combination of real constants, real dilogarithm values at real arguments, and a real arctangent.

2.  Candidate 2 contains the term  
   Li₂(√n/(√n+i)) − Li₂(√n/(√n−i)).  
   For real n > 0 these two arguments are complex conjugates, and with the standard (principal) branch one has  
   Li₂( z̄ ) =  conj[Li₂(z)].  
   Hence their difference is purely imaginary:  
   Li₂(z) − Li₂( z̄ ) = 2 i Im[Li₂(z)] ≠ 0 in general.

   Multiplying this purely imaginary quantity by the real factor −1/(2√n) leaves a purely imaginary contribution, so Candidate 2 yields a complex-valued result (π/(4√n) arctan√n plus a non-vanishing imaginary part).

3.  Since the integral in question is real whereas Candidate 2 is, in general, complex, the two expressions cannot be equivalent to each other (and in particular cannot both equal the sought real integral).

The two candidates give different analytical expressions for I(n).  
At n = 1, Candidate 1 yields the finite value I(1)=π²∕32, while Candidate 2’s formula involves Li₂ at an infinite argument (because the denominator in one of its fractions vanishes), resulting in a divergent/undefined expression. Since the two answers do not agree (indeed, Candidate 2 fails for a value allowed by the problem), the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:  (1/2) Γ((a+1)/2) b^{-(a+1)/2} · {}_1F_1\!\left((a+1)/2;\,1/2;\,1/(4b)\right)

These formulas differ in:
• the special functions used (a Meijer-G with argument b vs. a confluent hypergeometric {}_1F_1 with argument 1/(4b)),
• their overall prefactors.

Numerical checks for specific positive values of a and b (e.g., a=2, b=1 and a=0.5, b=1) show that the two expressions give different numerical results, confirming they are not equivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates are NOT equivalent.

The two candidates give different closed-form expressions whose numerical values disagree (e.g. for \(a=2,\; b=1\) candidate 2 exceeds the obvious upper bound \(\sqrt\pi/4\), so it cannot equal the integral, while candidate 1 might still satisfy the bound).

• Candidate 2: 16/3 = 5.333333…

Expressed to six significant digits:
– Candidate 1 → 5.33300  
– Candidate 2 → 5.33333  

Since 5.33300 ≠ 5.33333, the answers are different by Rule 4.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a single numerical area value.  
Candidate 1 gives 5.333.  
Candidate 2 gives 16/3.

Convert candidate 2: 16/3 = 5.333333…

Express both to 6 significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 → 5.33300 (implicit trailing zeros)  
• Candidate 2 → 5.33333

They differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits (0 ≠ 3), so by Rule 4 the answers are not equivalent.

The problem requires comparing the two numerical answers.

• Candidate 1 gives 1.0472  
• Candidate 2 gives π/3.

Numerically,
π/3 ≈ 1.047197551…

According to Rule 4 we must compare the answers to 6 significant digits.  
– π/3 rounded to 6 significant digits is 1.04720.  
– Candidate 1 provides only 5 significant digits (1.0472), leaving the 6th digit unspecified.

Because Candidate 1 does not match Candidate 2 to 6 significant digits, the two answers are considered different under the guideline.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same numerical value for the integral (to six significant digits, π/3 ≈ 1.04720 and 1.0472 can be written as 1.04720). Hence, the answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the value of the integral as a real number.

Convert candidate 2 to a decimal:  
π / 3 ≈ 1.047197 …

Express each answer to 6 significant digits:  
• Candidate 1: 1.0472 → 1.047200  
• Candidate 2: 1.047197 … → 1.047200 (rounded to 6 significant digits)

Since the two values are identical to 6 significant digits, the candidates are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 5.667  
Candidate 2 gives 17/3 ≈ 5.666666…

Expressed to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 5.66700  
• Candidate 2: 5.66667  

The sequences of six significant digits differ (…700 vs …667), so by Rule 4 the two answers are not the same.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives 5.667 (≈ 5.66700 to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives 17/3 (≈ 5.666666… → 5.66667 to six significant digits).

Comparing the six-significant-digit forms:

Candidate 1 supplies a single answer “163.”   
Candidate 2 supplies two answers “2, 163.”

The original question asks for both 1) the multiplicity of the root ξ = 1 and 2) the value of P′(2)+P″(2). Therefore two answers are required.

Candidate 1 gives only one number, omitting the multiplicity altogether, whereas Candidate 2 provides both required values. Because the number of answers differs and Candidate 1 is incomplete, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates give the same numerical value: –0.3.  

• Candidate 1 omits a unit, but the problem explicitly asks for a velocity in m/s, and m/s is the only reasonable unit here—no alternative units are plausible.  
• Candidate 2 includes the unit “m/s.”  

Since the numerical values match exactly (–0.300000 vs –0.300000) and the missing unit in Candidate 1 does not create ambiguity, the two answers are equivalent.

The question calls for a single numerical value (dy/dt) in m/s.

Candidate 1: 1.667  (unit omitted, but implicitly m/s)  
Candidate 2: 5/3 m/s = 1.666666…

To decide equivalence we apply Rule 4: compare to 6 significant digits.

• Candidate 1, padded to six significant digits, is 1.66700.  
• Candidate 2 to six significant digits is 1.66667.

Since 1.66700 ≠ 1.66667, the two answers do not match to six significant digits. Hence they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give numerical answers:

Candidate 1: 1.667  
Candidate 2: 5/3 m/s ≈ 1.666666…

Expressed to six significant digits:

Candidate 1 → 1.667000  
Candidate 2 → 1.666667

The values differ at the fourth significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not the same. Additionally, Candidate 1 omits the unit, while Candidate 2 includes “m/s,” introducing further potential ambiguity.

Both candidates give the same order-of-magnitude value (3 × 10⁻³⁶), but:

• Candidate 1: “3e-36” (only 1 significant digit, no unit stated)  
• Candidate 2: “3.0 × 10⁻³⁶ kg m/s” (2 significant digits, unit included)

Rule 4 requires agreement to 6 significant digits; since Candidate 1 supplies only 1 significant digit and Candidate 2 supplies 2, their values cannot be shown to match to 6 significant digits.  
Additionally, Rule 1 notes that omission of the required unit can make answers inequivalent.

Thus the predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 gives 0.098 (no unit).  
• Candidate 2 gives 0.098 nm.

Because the required unit is fixed by the question, the omission of the unit in Candidate 1 does not introduce real ambiguity—readers naturally interpret the number as being in nm. The numerical values are identical (0.098 vs 0.098) and thus match to at least six significant digits.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.
Both candidates give a single numerical answer of 0.098 (implicitly in the requested nm).

The question asks for an angle.  Angles can be expressed in at least two common units (degrees or radians).  
Candidate 2 explicitly states “7.1 degrees,” while Candidate 1 gives just “7.1” with no unit.  
Because a unit is omitted in Candidate 1 and more than one unit could reasonably be used, Rule 1 says this omission introduces ambiguity, so the two answers are not considered equivalent.

The question asks for an angle, and all angles mentioned in the problem statement are expressed in degrees. 

Candidate 1: “7.1”

      = (1/6) (x² + 4)^{3/2} / |x|³ + C.

Candidate 2 gives

F₂(x) = (x² + 4)^{3/2} / (6 x³) + C.

Hence  
F₁(x) = F₂(x) · (x³/|x³|) = F₂(x) · sign (x).

Therefore
• For x > 0, F₁ = F₂ + constant.  
• For x < 0, F₁ = –F₂, not differing merely by a constant.

Because the two expressions are not identical (and not just differing by an additive constant) on the entire domain of the integrand, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions simplify to  

Candidate 1: F₁(x)= (1/6)(x²+4)^{3/2}/(x²|x|)  
Candidate 2: F₂(x)= (1/6)(x²+4)^{3/2}/x³  

Hence  

F₁(x) = (x/|x|)·F₂(x) = sign(x)·F₂(x).

So for x>0 they coincide, but for x<0 they differ by a factor −1.  
Since this discrepancy cannot be absorbed into an additive constant, the two antiderivatives are not the same function on the whole domain x≠0.

Candidate 2: A(t) = 13 (4.75/13)^{t/12}
      = 13 · e^{(t/12) ln(4.75/13)}

Since (t/12) ln(4.75/13) = [ln(4.75/13)/12] · t, the exponents are identical, so the two models are mathematically the same. Thus the candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value expressed in the same units:

Candidate 1:  π·(72/5)  
Candidate 2:  (72/5)π

Multiplication is commutative, so these are identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates describe exactly the same set of solutions:

• Candidate 1 simplifies to x = 0.643501108… + 2πn (because π/2 − arcsin(4/5) = π/2 − arccos(3/5) = arctan(3/4)).  
• Candidate 2 explicitly gives x = arctan(3/4) + 2πn.

Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single infinite family of solutions of the form  

x = (constant) + 2πn , n ∈ ℤ.

Candidate 1’s constant is  
π/2 − arcsin(4/5)  (it also restates the same number as π/2 − arccos(3/5)).

Candidate 2’s constant is  
arctan(3/4).

Using the right-triangle with legs 3 and 4 and hypotenuse 5 we have  

arctan(3/4) = β, tan β = 3/4.  
Then sin β = 3/5 and cos β = 4/5.

Meanwhile  
π/2 − arcsin(4/5) = π/2 − θ, where sin θ = 4/5 ⇒ cos θ = 3/5.  
Hence sin(π/2 − θ) = cos θ = 3/5 and cos(π/2 − θ) = sin θ = 4/5,  
so tan(π/2 − θ) = (3/5)/(4/5) = 3/4, i.e.  
π/2 − arcsin(4/5) = arctan(3/4).

Thus the two constants are equal, and both candidates describe exactly the same set of solutions.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single family of solutions with period 2π.

•  Candidate 1:  
  x = –arcsin(4/5) + π/2 + 2π n  
  (the second expression is identical, just rewritten)

  Numerical value of the constant part:  
  –arcsin(4/5) + π/2 ≈ π/2 – 0.927295 ≈ 0.643501 rad.

•  Candidate 2:  
  x = arctan(3/4) + 2π n  
  arctan(3/4) ≈ 0.643501 rad.

Thus both candidates describe the same set {0.643501… + 2π n | n ∈ ℤ}.  
No additional or missing solutions appear in either answer, and both use radians.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.
The solutions given by both candidates represent the same single-parameter family of angles:

• Candidate 1’s two formulas both simplify to
  x = π/2 − arcsin(4/5) + 2πn = arccos(4/5) + 2πn = arcsin(3/5) + 2πn.

• Candidate 2 gives
  x = arctan(3/4) + 2πn.

Because arctan(3/4) = arcsin(3/5) = arccos(4/5), both candidates describe exactly the same set { x = 0.643501… + 2πn }. Hence their answers are equivalent.

Candidate 2:  y^{2/3} – x^{2/3} = 3  ⟺  –(y^{2/3} – x^{2/3}) = –3  ⟺  x^{2/3} – y^{2/3} = –3

Thus, after rearranging, the two equations are identical.

The two sets of answers differ in their treatment of the endpoints of the monotonicity intervals.

• Increasing interval  
  – Candidate 1: (−π/3, π/3) (open)  
  – Candidate 2: [−π/3, π/3] (closed)

• Decreasing intervals  
  – Candidate 1: (−π/2, −π/3) and (π/3, π/2) (open)  
  – Candidate 2: [−π/2, −π/3] and [π/3, π/2] (closed)

All other parts match exactly.  
Because the intervals given for monotonicity are not identical sets (the endpoints −π/3, π/3, −π/2, π/2 are included by Candidate 2 but excluded by Candidate 1), the two candidates’ answers are not exactly the same. Under the rules, this counts as a discrepancy.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different sets of answers for several sub-questions:

• Sub-question 2: Candidate 2 includes the endpoints −π/2 and π/2 in the decreasing intervals, while Candidate 1 does not.  
• Sub-question 3: Candidate 1 lists only one local minimum (−π/3), whereas Candidate 2 lists two (−π/3 and π/2).  
• Sub-question 4: Candidate 1 lists one local maximum (π/3), whereas Candidate 2 lists two (−π/2 and π/3).

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two overall answers are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives are

Candidate 1:   3 cos(5x) + cos³(5x)/sin²(5x) − (3/2) ln[(1+cos(5x))/(1−cos(5x))] + C  
Candidate 2:   cos(5x)/sin²(5x) + 2 cos(5x) − 3 ln| (1+cos(5x))/sin(5x) | + C

Step-by-step comparison:

1.  Rewrite the logarithmic piece of Candidate 1:

  (1+cos θ)/(1−cos θ) = [ (1+cos θ)/sin θ ]²   
  ⇒ ln[(1+cos θ)/(1−cos θ)] = 2 ln[(1+cos θ)/sin θ]

  So  
  −(3/2) ln[(1+cos θ)/(1−cos θ)] = −3 ln[(1+cos θ)/sin θ],

  matching the logarithmic term of Candidate 2 (the absolute-value bars just insure real values and change only by a possible constant).

2.  Rewrite the rational term of Candidate 1:

  cos³ θ / sin² θ = cos θ · (1 − sin² θ)/sin² θ   
           = cos θ / sin² θ − cos θ.

3.  Combine terms for Candidate 1:

  cos³ θ / sin² θ  + 3 cos θ  
  = (cos θ / sin² θ − cos θ) + 3 cos θ  
  = cos θ / sin² θ + 2 cos θ.

  This is exactly the sum of the first two terms in Candidate 2.

Thus, after these algebraic identities, every non-constant part of Candidate 1 coincides with the corresponding part of Candidate 2. Any remaining difference is at most an additive constant, which is irrelevant for an indefinite integral.

Therefore the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

The candidates give different solution sets when a = 1/√2.

• Candidate 1: always t = a.  
• Candidate 2: if a = 1/√2, then every t > 0 works (not just t = a).

Since a = 1/√2 is allowed by the problem statement (a > 0 and a ≠ 1), the two candidates give different answers in that situation. Hence they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives

• Minimum: 0

Candidate 2 gives
• Maximum: 4.755 (i.e., 4.755000 to six significant digits)  
• Minimum: 0

Comparing the maximum values to six significant digits:
– Candidate 1: 4.75528  
– Candidate 2: 4.75500  

Since 4.75528 ≠ 4.75500 at the 5th–6th significant digits, the two answers are not identical under Rule 4. Therefore the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives whose derivatives equal the integrand  cos³(x)/sin⁹(x).  
After rewriting Candidate 1 in terms of sin(x) only, its expression differs from Candidate 2’s result only by an additive constant (-1/24), which is immaterial for an indefinite integral. Therefore the two answers represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives differ only by an additive constant (specifically \( \tfrac{1}{24} \)), so they represent the same family of antiderivatives for the given integral.

Candidate 1 gives an antiderivative  
F₁(x)=−(1/8) cot⁸x−(1/3) cot⁶x−(1/4) cot⁴x+C.

Its derivative is  
F₁′(x)=cot³x csc⁶x=cos³x/ sin⁹x, which matches the integrand.

Candidate 2 gives  
F₂(x)=−1/(8 sin⁸x)+1/(6 sin⁶x)+C.

Its derivative is  
F₂′(x)=cos x(1/ sin⁹x−1/ sin⁷x)=cos x/ sin⁹x−cos x/ sin⁷x, which is different from the integrand cos³x/ sin⁹x.

Thus the two expressions are not equivalent antiderivatives of the given integrand.

The question asks for two items:  
1) the radius of convergence, and  
2) the sum of the series (i.e. a function that equals the series for every x in its domain, including x=0).

Both candidates give the radius of convergence as ∞, so they agree there.

For the sum:

• Candidate 1 gives a piece-wise function  
  f(x)= (x e^x − e^x + 1)/x² for x≠0, and f(0)=1/2.

• Candidate 2 gives only the single formula  
  (x e^x − e^x + 1)/x², without specifying x=0.

Although this formula agrees with Candidate 1’s on every x≠0, it is undefined at x=0 unless one explicitly adds the limiting value 1/2. Since Candidate 1 explicitly supplies that value while Candidate 2 does not, the two answers are not mathematically identical for all x, and Candidate 2 is missing information the problem implicitly requires (the value at x=0).

Hence the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.
The problem asks for TWO pieces of information  
1) the radius of convergence, and  
2) the sum of the series.

Candidate 1 supplies both:
• Radius = ∞  
• Sum = ((x-1)eˣ + 1)/x² (with the value ½ at x=0)

Candidate 2 supplies only the sum, ((x-1)eˣ + 1)/x², and gives no radius of convergence.

Because Candidate 2 is missing one of the required answers, the two candidates are not equivalent according to Rule 2 (all requested sub-answers must be present and match).

• Coefficient of y³:   2/3 in Candidate 1,  2 in Candidate 2.

2[∫₀^{π/3}2 dθ + ∫_{π/3}^{π/2}8cos²θ dθ]
= 2[(2)(π/3) + 8∫_{π/3}^{π/2}cos²θ dθ]

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by algebraic rearrangement of trigonometric identities:

• Candidate 2:  −2 cot(3x) − (4/3) cot³(3x) − (2/5) cot⁵(3x) + C

• Candidate 1 simplifies to
   −(2/5) cot csc⁴ − (8/15) cot csc² − (16/15) cot + C
   = −2 cot − (4/3) cot³ − (2/5) cot⁵ + C
   (using csc² = 1 + cot²).

After simplification, the two expressions are identical up to the constant of integration. Therefore the answers are equivalent.
The two antiderivatives can be shown to coincide after algebraic manipulation.

Candidate 2  
 −2 cot(3x) − (4/3) cot³(3x) − (2/5) cot⁵(3x)

Convert each power of cotangent to cos/sin:

cot = cos/sin  
cot³ = (cos³)/(sin³)  
cot⁵ = (cos⁵)/(sin⁵)

Now rewrite cos² and cos⁴ with 1 − sin²:

cos³/sin³ = (cos/sin³)(1 − sin²)  
cos⁵/sin⁵ = (cos/sin⁵)(1 − 2 sin² + sin⁴)

Substituting these into Candidate 2 and collecting like terms yields

−(2/5) cos(3x)/sin⁵(3x) − (8/15) cos(3x)/sin³(3x) − (16/15) cot(3x) + C,

which is exactly Candidate 1 (after distributing its constant factors).

Hence the two expressions differ only by an additive constant, so they are the same antiderivative.

The problem asks for two numerical answers: length and height.

Length:
• Candidate 1: 96 ft  
• Candidate 2: 96 ft  
→ identical.

Height:
• Candidate 1: 26.53 ft (no more digits provided)  
• Candidate 2: 8√11 ft ≈ 26.532998 ft  

To judge equivalence we must use Rule 4: both answers must agree to 6 significant digits.  
– Interpreting Candidate 1’s 26.53 as 26.530000 (missing digits treated as zeros), the value is 26.530000.  
– Candidate 2’s value to six significant digits is 26.532998.  

They differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits. Therefore, by the strict Rule 4 criterion, the heights are not the same, so the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for TWO values: the length and the height.

Candidate 1  
• Length: 96 ft  
• Height: ≈ 26.53 ft

Candidate 2  
• Length: 96 ft  
• Height: 8√11 ft  ≈ 26.532998 ft

Length: both give 96 ft → match.

Height:  
– Candidate 1 gives 26.53 ft → expressed to six significant digits: 26.5300  
– Candidate 2 gives 8√11 ft → ≈ 26.532998 ft → rounded to six significant digits: 26.5330  

Since 26.5300 ≠ 26.5330 at six significant digits, the two height values do not match per Rule 4.

Therefore, the two candidates’ overall answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates differ by an overall negative sign:

Candidate 1:  b · sec²(√(1 − x)) / [2 √(1 − x)]  
Candidate 2: –b · sec²(√(1 − x)) / [2 √(1 − x)]

Because these expressions are negatives of each other, they are not mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates give the derivative in exactly the same algebraic form:

Numerator: 4 x (ln x + 1) − 3 y  
Denominator: 3 x (ln x + 2) = 3 x (2 + ln x)

Since (ln x + 2) and (2 + ln x) are identical expressions, the two results are the same.

Candidate 2: { −7π/4, −5π/4, −3π/4, −π/4, π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4 }

The two lists contain exactly the same values, only in a different order. Since the problem does not require a specific ordering (Rule 3), order is irrelevant. Both candidates therefore provide identical solution sets, with no extra or missing elements.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates provide the same eight angles; they differ only in ordering.

Candidate 1:  {−7π/4, −5π/4, −3π/4, −π/4, π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4}
Candidate 2:  {−7π/4, −5π/4, −3π/4, −π/4, π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4}

Since the question does not require a specific order, we compare the sets (Rule 3) and find them identical. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for a “percentage error.”  

• Candidate 1 gives 0.003 (no percent sign).  
• Candidate 2 gives 0.3 %.

Interpreting Candidate 1’s 0.003 as a pure fraction, converting it to a percentage gives  
0.003 × 100 % = 0.3 %.

Thus both candidates state the same numerical value for the percentage error (0.3 %), merely expressed in different but directly convertible forms. Under Rule 1 this is acceptable, and the answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give two roots.

Candidate 1:  
x = 2 + √(13/2)   and   x = 2 − √(13/2)

Candidate 2:  
x = (4 + √26)/2   and   x = (4 − √26)/2  (≈ 4.55 and –0.55)

Note that  
√(13/2) = √13/√2 = √13·√2 /2 = √26 /2.

Therefore  
2 + √(13/2) = 2 + (√26)/2 = (4 + √26)/2  
and  
2 − √(13/2) = 2 − (√26)/2 = (4 − √26)/2.

Thus each root from Candidate 1 matches exactly the corresponding root from Candidate 2. Both candidates supply the same pair of solutions, merely written differently (exact form vs. rearranged exact form with decimals).

The two candidates give different expressions:

• Candidate 1: 1 / [16 · |sin(t/2)|]  
• Candidate 2: 1 / [16 · sin(t/2)]

Candidate 1 uses an absolute value, guaranteeing a non-negative curvature (as expected). Candidate 2 omits the absolute value, so its value can be negative whenever sin(t/2) < 0. Therefore the two answers are not mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ: Candidate 1 uses |sin(t/2)| in the denominator, guaranteeing a non-negative curvature, while Candidate 2 uses sin(t/2) without the absolute value, which can make the curvature negative when sin(t/2) < 0. Therefore, the two answers are not mathematically equivalent.

The two expressions are both valid antiderivatives of  

∫ sin⁻⁵(8 x) dx.  

Since any two antiderivatives of the same function can differ only by an additive constant, the two candidates are equivalent up to such a constant.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are antiderivatives of  

∫ csc⁵(8x) dx only if their difference is constant.  
Evaluating them numerically at two points gives:

x = 0.1  
 Candidate 1 ≈ –0.18609 + C₁  
 Candidate 2 ≈ –0.058999 + C₂  
 Difference ≈ –0.12709

x = 0.2  
 Candidate 1 ≈ 0.003652 + C₁  
 Candidate 2 ≈ 0.000873 + C₂  
 Difference ≈ 0.002779

The change in the difference (≈ 0.1299) shows it is not a constant; therefore the two antiderivatives are not equivalent (up to an additive constant).

Both candidates assert that the set of zeros is the closed interval from 2 to 4.  
• Candidate 1: “x ∈ [2, 4]”  
• Candidate 2: “[2, 4]”

Same interval, same endpoints, no unit issues, no extra or missing components. Hence they are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same interval notation, [2, 4], describing all real x between 2 and 4 inclusive. Candidate 1 explicitly writes “x ∈ [2,4]”; Candidate 2 simply writes “[2, 4]”, which in standard mathematical context also denotes the same closed interval. No difference in content or required elements exists. Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The two expressions are not always equal:

• Candidate 1 simplifies to  −(1/9)(1+3/x²)^{3/2}.  
  Rewriting gives −(1/9)(x²+3)^{3/2}/|x|³.

• Candidate 2 is  −(1/9)(x²+3)^{3/2}/x³.

These two coincide only when x>0 (where |x|=x). For x<0 they differ by a sign, so they are not the same antiderivative up to an additive constant over the whole domain. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives  
 F₁(x) = C − 1/9·(1 + 3/x²)·√(1 + 3/x²)

Candidate 2 gives  
 F₂(x) = C − (x² + 3)^{3/2}/(9x³)

Using √(x²) = |x|, rewrite F₁ (ignoring the arbitrary constant C):

(1 + 3/x²) = (x² + 3)/x²  
√(1 + 3/x²) = √(x² + 3)/|x|

Hence  
F₁(x) = − (x² + 3)^{3/2} / (9x²|x|)

Comparing with F₂(x):

F₂(x) = − (x² + 3)^{3/2} / (9x³)

Thus  
F₁(x) = (x/|x|) · F₂(x) = sign(x)·F₂(x)

Therefore  
• For x > 0, F₁(x) = F₂(x)  
• For x < 0, F₁(x) = −F₂(x)

Since they differ by a factor of −1 on x<0, the two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant on the whole real line. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Both antiderivatives give the same derivative (the integrand 3 cot⁶(7x)), and their difference  
F₁ – F₂ = (3/7) arctan(cot 7x) + 3x

Both candidates give:

Normal vector:
Candidate 1: (1, −1)
Candidate 2: (−5, 5) = −5 · (1, −1)  → same direction (scalar multiple).

Tangent vector:
Both give (1, 1).

Since, for vectors, any non-zero scalar multiple is considered the same direction, the normal vectors are equivalent, and the tangent vectors match exactly. Therefore the two candidate answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates supply the two required items (normal vector and tangent vector).

• Candidate 2: N = (–5, 5) = –5 · (1, –1), T = (5, 5) = 5 · (1, 1)

Each corresponding vector pair differs only by a non-zero scalar multiple, so they represent the same directions. Hence the two sets of answers are mathematically identical.

Both candidates agree on items 1–6, but for item 7:

• Candidate 2 gives the full coordinate: (2^{10/3}, 9/2^{10/3}), i.e. x = 8·2^{1/3} together with the corresponding y–value.

The question asks for “the inflection points,” which ordinarily means the full (x, y) point(s). Candidate 1 omits the y–coordinate, so the two answers are not identical. According to Rule 2, an answer that omits a required component is not equivalent to one that supplies it.

The two expressions can be rewritten to see if they match.

Candidate 1:
(π − ln 4)/4 − π²/48  
= [12(π − ln 4) − π²]/48  
= (12π − 12 ln 4 − π²)/48  
Since ln 4 = 2 ln 2, this becomes  
= (12π − π² − 24 ln 2)/48

Candidate 2 is already
(12π − π² − 24 ln 2)/48

They are identical.

The two antiderivatives only need to differ by an overall constant to be equivalent.

Let  
F₁(x) = cot x − (1/3) cot³x − arctan(cot x) + C₁  (Candidate 1 without its arbitrary constant)  
F₂(x) = x + cot x − (1/3) cot³x + C₂           (Candidate 2)

Compute their difference:

F₁(x) − F₂(x) = −arctan(cot x) − x + (C₁ − C₂).

Now check whether arctan(cot x) + x is constant.  
Differentiate:

d/dx[arctan(cot x) + x]  
= (1 / (1 + cot²x)) · (−csc²x) + 1  
= (1 / csc²x)(−csc²x) + 1  
= −1 + 1  
= 0.

Since its derivative is zero, arctan(cot x) + x is indeed a constant (on any interval where cot x is defined). Therefore F₁(x) − F₂(x) is just an overall constant, meaning the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Thus Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are equivalent.

Candidate 1 also states the corresponding maximum value, but this extra, consistent information does not create a conflict. Since the question’s essential requirement is to identify where the maximum occurs, the two answers coincide.

4.  One can show (or check numerically) that  
   (b−a)(x+ab)/(b+a)=−3, so D(x)=−9 ln 3, a constant.

The two candidates give expressions for the same single quantity (the derivative).  
We can rewrite Candidate 1:

E(x) = (tan x)^4 + 4(tan x)^2 + 6 + 4/(tan x)^2 + 1/(tan x)^4

Multiply numerator and denominator by sin^4 x cos^4 x:

E(x) = [sin^8 x + 4 sin^6 x cos^2 x + 6 sin^4 x cos^4 x + 4 sin^2 x cos^6 x + cos^8 x] / (sin^4 x cos^4 x)

The bracketed numerator is exactly the expansion of (sin^2 x + cos^2 x)^4 = 1^4 = 1. Hence

E(x) = 1 / (sin^4 x cos^4 x)  
     = 16 / sin^4(2x)  
     = 16 csc^4(2x).

This is precisely Candidate 2’s result.

Reasoning:
After algebraic simplification,

• Candidate 1 (without the “+ C”) becomes
 (2x² − 3)(1 + x²)^{3/2} / (15 x^5).

• Candidate 2 (without the “+ C”) is
 (2x² − 3)√(1 + x²) / (15 x^5).

Hence Candidate 1 = (1 + x²)·Candidate 2.  
The factor (1 + x²) is not a constant (it depends on x), so the two antiderivatives differ by more than an additive constant. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both expressions can be rewritten in a common form.

Candidate 1:
Let  
u = (1 + x²)/x².  
Then  
(1/3)u^{3/2} − (1/5)u^{5/2}  
= (1/3)(1+x²)^{3/2}/x³ − (1/5)(1+x²)^{5/2}/x⁵  
= (1+x²)^{3/2}/x⁵ · [ (1/3)x² − (1/5)(x²+1) ]  
= (1+x²)^{3/2}/x⁵ · (2x² − 3)/15  
= (2x² − 3)(1+x²)^{3/2}/(15x⁵).

Candidate 2 is exactly  
(2x² − 3)(1+x²)^{3/2}/(15x⁵) + C.

Thus the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by a constant of integration. They are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions can be rewritten into the same algebraic form (up to an additive constant):

Candidate 1  
= (1/3)(1/x²+1)^{3/2} − (1/5)(1/x²+1)^{5/2} + C  
= (2x²−3)(x²+1)^{3/2}/(15x⁵) + C

Candidate 2  
= (2x²−3)(x²+1)^{3/2}/(15x⁵)

Thus Candidate 1 differs from Candidate 2 only by the arbitrary constant of integration, which is permissible for an indefinite integral. Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The two antiderivatives coincide for x > 0, but for x < 0 candidate 1 contains |x| in the denominator (implicitly), whereas candidate 2 has x⁵.  Consequently,

•  For x > 0:  candidate 1 = candidate 2 (up to the same constant C).  
•  For x < 0:  candidate 1 = − candidate 2, so their difference depends on x and is not a constant.

Because an antiderivative is defined only up to an additive constant and the two expressions do not differ by a constant on the entire domain, the answers are not equivalent.

Both expressions are the same up to algebraic simplification and an arbitrary additive constant:

1. Candidate 1’s argument of arctan:
   (2/√7)·(½ + tan 2x) = (2 tan 2x + 1)/√7  
2. Candidate 2’s argument of arctan:
   (2 tan 2x + 1)/√7  

Thus the integrand inside arctan is identical. Both overall results are
−(2/√7) arctan( … ) plus an arbitrary constant, just written in a different order.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.
Both answers express the antiderivative as   

−(2 / √7) · arctan[(2 tan(2x)+1)/√7]  +  constant.

Candidate 1 just writes the constant first (“C − …”), while Candidate 2 writes it last (“… + C”).  
Since an additive constant can be written in any order, the two expressions are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give the antiderivative

-(2/√7) · arctan[(2 tan (2x)+1)/√7]  +  constant.

Candidate 1’s inner argument
  (2/√7)(½+tan 2x) = (1+2 tan 2x)/√7,
which is identical to Candidate 2’s.

The overall factor –2/√7 and an arbitrary additive constant are also the same in both expressions (writing “C – …” or “– … + C” makes no difference).

Hence the two answers represent the same function up to an irrelevant constant shift.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different answers for several sub-questions:

• Increasing intervals:

  – Candidate 2: (–∞, –9) and (–3, ∞)

• Concave-up intervals:  
  – Candidate 1: (–∞, –9), (–3, 0), (0, ∞)  
  – Candidate 2: (0, ∞)

• Concave-down intervals (also inconsistent with the above).  

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two overall predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates disagree on several of the requested items:

• Increasing intervals: C-1 splits the region (–3, ∞) at 0, while C-2 uses a single interval; the sets differ by the point 0.  
• Concave-up intervals: C-1 lists (–∞, –9) and (–3, 0) and (0, ∞); C-2 lists only (0, ∞).  
• Concave-down intervals: correspondingly different (and C-1 even repeats (–3, 0) in both up and down).

Because at least one sub-answer is different, the two overall answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates must match on every sub-answer.  
Differences:

• Increasing intervals – Candidate 1 excludes the point x = 0 (lists (-3,0) ∪ (0,∞)); Candidate 2 includes it (lists (-3,∞)).  
• Concavity – Candidate 1 says concave-up on (-∞,-9) ∪ (-3,0) ∪ (0,∞); Candidate 2 says concave-up only on (0,∞).

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:  
4/75 tan^{3/2}(10x) + 4/175 tan^{7/2}(10x) + C

The expressions can be algebraically compared.

Candidate 1  
f′(x)=−(cos²x)/15 · [3 sin x (cos²x−5)+cos x sin(2x)]

Since sin(2x)=2 sin x cos x, the bracket simplifies to  
3 sin x (cos²x−5)+2 sin x cos²x  
= sin x[3 cos²x−15+2 cos²x]  
= 5 sin x(cos²x−3).

Hence  
f′(x)=−(cos²x)/15·5 sin x(cos²x−3) = −(1/3) sin x cos²x(cos²x−3).

Candidate 2  
f′(x)= (1/3) sin x cos²x(3−cos²x)  
= (1/3) sin x cos²x[−(cos²x−3)]  
= −(1/3) sin x cos²x(cos²x−3).

Both simplify to the identical form −(1/3) sin x cos²x (cos²x−3).

Candidate 1 writes every occurrence of  
 √(5x² – 2x + 1) / |x|  

and uses ln |···|, hence the result is valid (and real-valued) for both x>0 and x<0 (x≠0).

Candidate 2 replaces |x| by x and omits the absolute–value bars in the logarithm, giving  
 √(5x² – 2x + 1) / x  
and ln(···) (no absolute value).  
For x>0 these two expressions coincide up to an additive constant, but for x<0 they differ by a non-constant factor of –1 in the radical term and the logarithm is no longer defined in the real domain. Hence the two antiderivatives are not the same on the whole domain of the integrand, and their difference is not a mere constant.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

  – minimum at (0, π/4).

• Candidate 2 gives only x-values:

Both candidates give an antiderivative of tan⁴x.

Candidate 1:  (1/3) tan³x − tan x + arctan(tan x) + C₁  
Candidate 2:  (1/3) tan³x − tan x + x + C₂

The extra terms differ by arctan(tan x) − x.  
On any open interval where tan x is continuous (between its vertical asymptotes x = π/2+kπ),
arctan(tan x) = x + kπ for some integer k, so arctan(tan x) − x is a constant (kπ) on that interval.  

Hence the two expressions differ only by an additive constant (possibly different constants on different continuity intervals), which is exactly the degree of freedom allowed for indefinite integrals. Therefore they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives whose derivatives equal tan⁴x.  
On any open interval where tan x is continuous (i.e., between successive vertical asymptotes x = π/2 + kπ),

• arctan(tan x) = x + kπ (with fixed integer k on that interval),  
so arctan(tan x) – x is a constant on that interval.

Hence

Candidate 1 − Candidate 2 = [arctan(tan x) − x] + (const)

is just a constant on each interval of definition, which is exactly the freedom allowed for indefinite integrals. Therefore the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives of tan⁴x.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give explicit antiderivatives of tan⁴x.

• Candidate 1:  F₁(x)= (1/3)tan³x − tan x + arctan(tan x) + C  
• Candidate 2:  F₂(x)= (1/3)tan³x − tan x + x + C

Compute the difference (ignoring the arbitrary constant C common to both):

F₁(x) − F₂(x) = arctan(tan x) − x.

On every interval where tan x is continuous (i.e. between its vertical asymptotes x = π/2 + kπ), arctan(tan x) equals x up to an integer multiple of π; therefore the derivative of arctan(tan x) − x is zero on each such interval, so the difference is a constant there. Since an indefinite integral is defined only up to an additive constant on each continuity interval of the integrand, the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Hence the two candidates are mathematically equivalent answers to the integral.

Both candidates give the same constant term 2/π and subtract the same series factor −4/π multiplied by cosines of even multiples.  
For each term k (k = 1, 2, 3, …):

• Candidate 1 denominator: (2k−1)(2k+1)  
• Candidate 2 denominator: 4k² − 1  

Since (2k−1)(2k+1) = 4k² − 1, the term-by-term denominators are identical, and both series run over cos(2k x). Hence the two expressions are mathematically the same.

 • n odd  ⇒ t =  π/6 + π + 2kπ = 7π/6 + 2kπ

Both candidates express the antiderivative in terms of  

u = tan(x/2) ,  with powers u^(2/3) and u^(4/3).

After rewriting Candidate 1,

C₁ = ½ ln|u^(4/3) − u^(2/3) + 1| − √3 arctan[(2u^(2/3) − 1)/√3] − ln(1 + u^(2/3)) + C.

Candidate 2 is

C₂ = −ln(1 + u^(2/3)) + ½ ln(u^(4/3) − u^(2/3) + 1) − √3 arctan[(2u^(2/3) − 1)/√3] + C.

These differ only by:

• order of terms (irrelevant),  
• absolute-value bars in the second logarithm (the argument u^(4/3) − u^(2/3) + 1 = v² − v + 1 with v = u^(2/3) is strictly positive for all real u, so |⋅| is superfluous),  
• an arbitrary constant of integration.

Thus they differ only by an arbitrary constant of integration, so they are equivalent.
The two antiderivatives can be rewritten in comparable form:

Candidate 1  
F₁(x)= (x³+3)^{1/3}/(9x) + x²/[18 (x³+3)^{2/3}] + C  

Candidate 2  
F₂(x)= 1/[3x (x³+3)^{2/3}] + x²/[6 (x³+3)^{2/3}] + C  

Compare the coefficients:

• For the x²-term: F₁ has 1/18, while F₂ has 1/6 (three times larger).  
• For the 1/x-term: F₁ has (x³+3)^{1/3}/(9x) = (x³+3)/(9)·1/[x (x³+3)^{2/3}], whereas F₂ has 1/[3x (x³+3)^{2/3}]. These differ by the factor (x³+3)/3, which is not a constant.

Since the difference between F₁ and F₂ is not merely an additive constant, the two candidates are not equivalent antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both antiderivatives can be rewritten in the same form:

Candidate 1 (without the “+ C”)  
= (1/9) (1+3/x³)^{1/3} + (1/18) (1+3/x³)^{-2/3}  
= (x³+3)^{1/3}/(9x) + x²/[18 (x³+3)^{2/3}]  
= (x³+2)/[6x (x³+3)^{2/3}]  

which is exactly Candidate 2 (up to the arbitrary integration constant C). Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

The question asks for “local extrema of the function,” which in standard usage refers to the extrema points (x, f(x)), i.e. both the x-locations and the corresponding function values.

• Candidate 1 supplies only the x-coordinates:
  – Local maxima at x = ±(8/27)^{1/4}
  – Local minimum at x = 0
  (No y-values are given.)

• Candidate 2 supplies both the x- and y-coordinates:
  – Local maxima at ( ±(2/3)^{3/4}, 4√6/9 )
  – Local minimum at (0, 0)

Although the x-coordinates given in Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 match (because (8/27)^{1/4} = (2/3)^{3/4}), Candidate 1 omits the y-values that are part of the extrema points. Under Rule 2, omitting a required component means the answers are not equivalent. The two responses therefore differ in the information they provide.

Both candidates present the antiderivative as a sum of the same four functional terms plus an arbitrary constant C:

1. (3/2) · ∛(x²)
2. –15 · ∛x
3. 60 · ln(4 + ∛x)  (Cand 1 writes ln|4+∛x|; when x ≥ 0, 4+∛x > 0, so the absolute-value bars do not change the function, only a possible constant.)
4. –3 · arctan(∛(x)/2)  (the argument written as (1/2)·x^{1/6} or x^{1/6}/2 is identical)

The terms appear in a different order, but addition is commutative. Any difference in the placement of the integration constant C is irrelevant. Hence the two expressions differ, at most, by a constant, making them the same antiderivative.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 contain the same algebraic terms except for the logarithmic one:  

• Candidate 1 has 60 ln |4 + ∛x|  
• Candidate 2 has 60 ln (4 + ∛x)

ln|u| and ln u are not the same function on intervals where u is negative; they coincide only where u > 0.  
Because 4 + ∛x can be negative (for x < −64), the two antiderivatives are not the same on every interval where the integrand is defined. Hence they are not equivalent up to an additive constant on the full real domain.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers give exactly the same symbolic antiderivative, term-by-term:

1.  3/2 x^{2/3}          – identical  
2.  –15 x^{1/3}          – identical  
3.  60 ln(4+x^{1/3})     – Candidate 1 writes ln|4+x^{1/3}|; adding the absolute–value bars does not change the derivative, so the two differ at most by a constant and therefore represent the same antiderivative.  
4.  –3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2) – identical  
5.  + C                  – both include an arbitrary constant.

Hence the two expressions are equivalent antiderivatives (they differ, at most, by a constant).

Candidate 1 introduces two independent integers n and k, which allow x and y to be shifted by different multiples of π (x gets +π n, y gets −π n).  
Explicitly, in the first family

 x = π/3 + π n + π/2 k, y = π/6 – π n + π/2 k,

so the two shift parameters for x and y are generally different (k+2n vs. k–2n).

Candidate 2, on the other hand, uses only a single integer k and therefore shifts x and y by the same multiple of π/2:

 x = π/3 + π/2 k, y = π/6 + π/2 k, or the swapped pair.

Hence every solution of Candidate 2 (k fixed) is included in Candidate 1 (take n = 0), but Candidate 1 also contains solutions where the shifts of x and y differ (n ≠ 0).  
These extra (x, y) pairs are not produced by Candidate 2, even when angles are taken modulo 2π, because Candidate 2 requires the same shift parameter for both variables.

Therefore the two answer sets are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 2 gives only the pairs  
1) x = π/3 + (π/2) k , y = π/6 + (π/2) k  
2) x = π/6 + (π/2) k , y = π/3 + (π/2) k  (k ∈ ℤ)  
so the same integer k must be used in x and y.

Candidate 1 parametrises the solutions with two independent integers n and k:

x = π/3 + (π/2)(2n + k)   or   x = π/6 + (π/2)(2n + k)  
y = π/6 + (π/2)(k – 2n)   or   y = π/3 + (π/2)(k – 2n)

For any n ≠ 0, the shift applied to x (2n+k) is different from the shift applied to y (k–2n), so these pairs are NOT of the form required by Candidate 2 (where the same shift must appear in both coordinates).  
Only when n = 0 do the formulas of Candidate 1 collapse to the two families listed by Candidate 2. Thus:

• every solution of Candidate 2 appears in Candidate 1 (take n = 0),  
• but Candidate 1 contains extra solutions (all cases with n ≠ 0) that are absent in Candidate 2.

Since the two answer sets are not identical, the predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers describe the same set of ordered pairs (x , y) modulo 2π.

1.  Candidate 1 gives two families
      (a)  x = π/3 + (π/2)(2n + k) , y = π/6 + (π/2)(k – 2n)  
      (b)  x = π/6 + (π/2)(2n + k) , y = π/3 + (π/2)(k – 2n)  
     with n , k ∈ ℤ.

     In each family we can set k′ = k + 2n.  Then

        x = π/3 + (π/2)k′                      (or x = π/6 + (π/2)k′),
        y = π/6 + (π/2)k′ – 2πn                (or y = π/3 + (π/2)k′ – 2πn).

     Because subtracting an integer multiple of 2π leaves the angle unchanged, this is
        (x, y) ≡ (π/3 + (π/2)k′ , π/6 + (π/2)k′)  (or the swapped pair)
     modulo 2π.

2.  Candidate 2 lists exactly those two possibilities
        (π/6 + (π/2)k ,  π/3 + (π/2)k) or (π/3 + (π/2)k ,  π/6 + (π/2)k),
     k ∈ ℤ.

Thus every pair produced by Candidate 1 corresponds to some pair of Candidate 2 (up to adding integer multiples of 2π), and vice-versa.  The two candidates are therefore equivalent.

The problem may have multiple real solutions.  
Candidate 1 lists two solutions: −2 and 6.

Candidate 1 gives   (ln x · ln b) / ln a  + C  
Candidate 2 gives   (ln b / ln a) · ln|x|  + C

The two expressions differ by the presence of the absolute‐value sign inside the logarithm.  
• For x > 0, ln x = ln|x|, so the expressions match.  
• For x < 0, ln x is undefined while ln|x| is defined, so the two answers are not the same antiderivative over the whole domain x ≠ 0 required by the problem.  

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Both answers represent antiderivatives of the integrand and differ only by an additive constant:  

1.  Write  
   u = √(x + 6), v = √(x – 6) ⇒ √((x + 6)/(x – 6)) = u / v.  

2.  Candidate 1: F₁(x) = (x – 30) u/v – 18 ln|(v – u)/(v + u)| + C.  
    Candidate 2: F₂(x) = –24 u/v + uv – 18 ln|x – uv| + C   
    (because √(x² – 36) = uv).

3.  Their difference is  
        F₁ – F₂ = uv – uv – 18 ln|(v – u)/(v + u)| + 18 ln|x – uv|  
                = –18 ln|(v – u)/(v + u)(1/(x – uv))|.

4.  But x – uv = v² + 6 – uv and straightforward algebra shows  
        |(v – u)/(v + u)| / |x – uv| = 1/6,  
   a constant independent of x.

5.  Therefore F₁ – F₂ = –18 ln(1/6) = 18 ln 6, a constant, which can be absorbed into the arbitrary constant of integration.

Since the two expressions differ only by a constant, they are equivalent antiderivatives.

The two candidates give different algebraic expressions for the second derivative.

• Denominators  
  C1:  −3375 cos⁶t sin³t  
  C2:  25 cos⁵t sin²t  
  ⇒  D₁ = (−135 cos t sin t)·D₂.

• Therefore we would need N₁ = (−135 cos t sin t)·N₂ for the results to be equal.

• Computing (−135 cos t sin t)·N₂ and expanding shows

  (−135 cos t sin t)·N₂  
  = −4860 cos t sin t sin(3t) + 7290 cos t sin t sin³(3t)  
    −1620 sin²(3t) cos(3t)(3 cos²t − 2),

while C1’s numerator is

  N₁ = −4860 cos²t sin t sin(3t) + 7290 cos²t sin t sin³(3t)  
        −1620 cos t sin²(3t) cos(3t) + 2430 cos³t sin²(3t) cos(3t).

The two numerators differ by powers of cos t and overall coefficients in each term, so N₁ ≠ (−135 cos t sin t)·N₂.

Hence the two candidate expressions are not mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates list two infinite families of solutions.

2.  2πk − 2 arctan 7   (Candidate 1)  
    π + arctan(7/24) + 2πn   (Candidate 2)  

   Using the identity  
   tan(–2 arctan 7) = 7/24, and because –2 arctan 7 lies in the third quadrant,  
   –2 arctan 7 ≡ π + arctan(7/24)  (mod 2π).  
   Hence these two formulas describe the same set of angles.

Therefore the two candidates give exactly the same solution set.

The family supplied by Candidate 2 coincides with Candidate 1’s first family (they differ by an integer multiple of 2π), but it does not reproduce Candidate 1’s second family x = π + 2πk.  
Since the two sets of answers are therefore not identical, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives can differ at most by an additive constant.  
Rewrite Candidate 2’s extra term using the identity  
sin³θ = (3 sin θ − sin 3θ)/4.

Take θ = 6x:

sin³(6x) / 9  
= [3 sin(6x) − sin(18x)] / (4·9)  
= (1/12) sin(6x) − (1/36) sin(18x).

Thus Candidate 2 equals  

−x + (1/12) sin(12x) + (1/12) sin(6x) − (1/36) sin(18x) + C,

which is exactly Candidate 1 (up to the choice of the constant C).  
Hence the two answers are mathematically the same antiderivative.

Although this value equals 6·2^{1/3} numerically, Candidate 2 fails to state whether it is the minimum or maximum and gives no information about the other required quantity.

Both candidates present antiderivatives of the integrand 2 cot⁶(14x).

1. When the common polynomial part (−cot⁵/35 + cot³/21 − cot/7) is differentiated, both yield 2(cot⁶ + 1).

2. Candidate 2 adds −2x, whose derivative is −2, giving the correct total derivative 2 cot⁶.

3. Candidate 1 adds +(1/7) arctan(cot 14x); its derivative is −2 as well, so the total derivative is also 2 cot⁶.

4. The difference between the two antiderivatives is
   (1/7) arctan(cot 14x) + 2x, whose derivative is (−2) + 2 = 0, hence this difference is a constant.

Because the two expressions differ only by an additive constant, they represent the same family of antiderivatives and are therefore equivalent.

we have dD/dx = −2 + 2 = 0, so D(x) is a constant.

The two antiderivatives differ only by  

(3/2) ln|tan x| + (3/4) ln|(1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x – 1)|.

But  
(1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x – 1)=2 cos²x/(–2 sin²x)= –cot²x, and with absolute value  
ln|(1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x – 1)| = ln(cot²x)=2 ln|cot x|.

Hence  

(3/2) ln|tan x| + (3/4)·2 ln|cot x|  
= (3/2)(ln|tan x| + ln|cot x|)  
= (3/2)(ln|sin x| – ln|cos x| + ln|cos x| – ln|sin x|) = 0.

So the difference between Candidate 2 and Candidate 1 is just an additive constant.  
Therefore the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions can be rewritten in the same elementary pieces.

Candidate 1  
 = (3/2)C  + (1/2) cos³(2x) + (3/2) cos(2x) − (3/4) ln |(1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x−1)|

Use 1+cos 2x = 2 cos²x and cos 2x−1 = −2 sin²x, so  
 (1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x−1) = −cot²x.  
With the absolute value the sign disappears, ln|−cot²x| = ln(cot²x) = 2 ln|cot x| = −2 ln|tan x|.

Hence the log term becomes  
 −(3/4)(−2 ln|tan x|) = (3/2) ln|tan x|.

Thus Candidate 1 simplifies to  
 (1/2) cos³ 2x + (3/2) cos 2x + (3/2) ln|tan x| + (constant),

which is exactly Candidate 2 (since an overall additive constant is arbitrary in an indefinite integral).

Therefore the two answers differ at most by a constant and are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give an antiderivative that, up to an additive constant, can be written in the form  

(1/2) cos³(2x) + (3/2) cos(2x) + (3/2) ln|tan x| + C.

Candidate 1’s logarithmic term  
−(3/4) ln |(1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x−1)|  
equals (3/2) ln|tan x| because  

|(1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x−1)| = |cot² x| = 1/tan² x  
⇒ ln of that ratio = −2 ln|tan x|.  

Multiplying by −3/4 gives (3/2) ln|tan x|, exactly the term in Candidate 2.

Thus the two antiderivatives differ only by a constant and are mathematically equivalent.

Both answers intend to give the first four non-zero Taylor terms about x = −1.  
Rewrite Candidate 1 with s = x+1:

x = s−1,

x·(1−3s+6s²−10s³+⋯)  
= (s−1)(1−3s+6s²−10s³+⋯)  
= −1 + 4s − 9s² + 16s³ + ⋯  
= −1 + 4(x+1) − 9(x+1)² + 16(x+1)³ + ⋯

The first four non-zero terms are exactly the same as Candidate 2’s
−1 + 4(x+1) − 9(x+1)² + 16(x+1)³ (Candidate 2 just omitted the “+ …”).

Hence the two candidates give equivalent series (up to the requested four terms).

Candidate 1:  
 S₁(x) = −x − 2√x − 2 ln|√x − 1|

Candidate 2:  
 S₂(x) = −x − 2√x − 2 ln(1 − √x)

For the series in the problem the real variable x must satisfy 0 ≤ x < 1 (|√x|<1 is needed for convergence).  
In this interval we have 1 − √x > 0, so

 ln|√x − 1| = ln|1 − √x| = ln(1 − √x).

Thus, on the whole domain where the series is defined, ln|√x − 1| equals ln(1 − √x).  
Consequently

 S₁(x) = S₂(x)  for every admissible x.

The two answers differ only by the absolute–value notation, which makes no difference on the relevant domain; therefore they are mathematically identical as results to the question.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ only by the presence of an absolute-value symbol around the logarithm’s argument:

Candidate 1: −x − 2√x − 2 ln|√x − 1|
Candidate 2: −x − 2√x − 2 ln(1 − √x)

For the domain in which the given power series converges (|√x| < 1, i.e. 0 ≤ x < 1 for real x), the quantity 1 − √x is positive, so |√x − 1| = 1 − √x. Consequently

ln|√x − 1| = ln(1 − √x),

making the two formulas identical on that domain. Hence the two candidates provide equivalent answers to the problem.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give

–x – 2√x – 2 ln(…)  

with the only difference being
ln|√x – 1| (Candidate 1) versus ln(1 – √x) (Candidate 2).

The series in the question converges only when |√x| < 1 (for real x, this is 0 ≤ x < 1). In that domain we have √x < 1, so |√x – 1| = 1 – √x. Therefore

ln|√x – 1| = ln(1 – √x)

throughout the domain where the sum is defined. Thus the two expressions coincide wherever the series sum is valid.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates can be rewritten to the same expression:

Candidate 1:
2 sin³(x/2)/cos(x/2) − 3x/2 + 3 sin x/2 + C  
 = 2 [sin(x/2)/cos(x/2)] − sin x − 3x/2 + 3 sin x/2 + C  
 = 2 tan(x/2) − sin x − 3x/2 + 3 sin x/2 + C  
 = 2 tan(x/2) − 3x/2 + (−sin x + 3 sin x/2) + C  
 = 2 tan(x/2) − 3x/2 + ½ sin x + C.

Candidate 2 already gives:
2 tan(x/2) − 3x/2 + ½ sin x + C.

They differ only by a constant of integration, which is immaterial for an indefinite integral. Hence the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by (at most) an additive constant.

Compute the difference:

F₁(x) − F₂(x)
= [2 sin³(x/2)/cos(x/2) − 3x/2 + (3/2) sin x]
  − [2 tan(x/2) − 3x/2 + (1/2) sin x]

= 2[sin³(x/2) − sin(x/2)]/cos(x/2) + sin x

= 2 sin(x/2)(sin²(x/2) − 1)/cos(x/2) + sin x

Since sin²(θ) − 1 = −cos²(θ),

= 2 sin(x/2)(−cos²(x/2))/cos(x/2) + sin x
= −2 sin(x/2) cos(x/2) + sin x
= −sin x + sin x
= 0.

The difference is a constant (in fact 0), so the antiderivatives are equivalent.

which differs from Candidate 2 only by the name/sign of the arbitrary constant.

Candidate 2 gives the numerical value 0.00197 (interpretable as 0.00197000 to six significant digits).  

Comparing to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.00196793 → digits 1 9 6 7 9 3  
• Candidate 2: 0.00197000 → digits 1 9 7 0 0 0  

The digits differ beginning at the third significant digit, so the two answers are not the same to six significant digits. According to Rule 4, the candidates are therefore not equivalent.

Both candidates can be rewritten as

F₁(x) = ⅓·tan³(10x)/5 – tan(10x)/5 + (1/5)·arctan(tan(10x)) + C  
F₂(x) = ⅓·tan³(10x)/5 – tan(10x)/5 + 2x + C

The two differ by
F₂(x) – F₁(x) = 2x – (1/5)·arctan(tan(10x)) + constant.

Differentiate that difference:

d/dx[2x] = 2  
d/dx[(1/5)·arctan(tan(10x))]  
 = (1/5) · 1/(1 + tan²(10x)) · 10·sec²(10x)  
 = (1/5) · 10 = 2.

Hence the derivative of their difference is 2 – 2 = 0 (away from the jump points of arctan(tan )). So on every open interval where the integrand is continuous their difference is a constant, meaning the two antiderivatives are equivalent up to an additive constant, which is all that is required for an indefinite integral.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives whose derivatives equal the integrand 2 tan⁴(–10x) (which equals 2 tan⁴(10x)).

Subtracting the two expressions,

(2x − tan(10x)/5 + tan³(10x)/15)  
− [ (1/15)tan³(10x) + (1/5)arctan(tan(10x)) − tan(10x)/5 ]

= 2x − (1/5)arctan(tan(10x)),

whose derivative is 2 − (1/5)·10 = 0 (except at the points where tan is undefined). Thus the two antiderivatives differ only by a constant on every interval where the integrand is defined. Hence they are equivalent up to an additive constant, as required for indefinite integrals.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives can differ only by a single (global) constant in order to be equivalent.  
Write

F₁(x) = 1/15 tan³(10x) − 1/5 tan(10x) + 1/5 arctan(tan(10x))  
F₂(x) = 2x − 1/5 tan(10x) + 1/15 tan³(10x).

Hence  
F₁(x) − F₂(x) = (1/5) arctan(tan(10x)) − 2x.

Because arctan(tan y) equals y − nπ on each interval ((n − ½)π, (n + ½)π), this difference equals −nπ/5, where n depends on x.  
Therefore F₁ − F₂ is not a single constant; it jumps by π/5 whenever 10x crosses an odd multiple of π/2.  

Since the two candidates are not related by one constant throughout their common domain, their answers are not equivalent.

= (x² + 10x − 59)/(3√(2x − 5)) + C.

Candidate 2 is already
(x² + 10x − 59)/(3√(2x − 5)) + C.

• 2nd sub-answer (|f(1) − P₄(1)|):

1. Domain – Candidate 1 writes “(-1·∞, -2)” which is simply “-∞” times –1, i.e. “(-∞, -2)”. Thus both give (-∞, -2) ∪ (-2, 2) ∪ (2, ∞).  
2. Vertical asymptotes – x = ±2  
3. Horizontal asymptote – y = 0  
4. Slant asymptotes – none  
5. Increasing – (0, 2) and (2, ∞)  
6. Decreasing – (-∞, -2) and (-2, 0)  
7. Concave up – (-2, 2)  
8. Concave down – (-∞, -2) and (2, ∞)  
9. Inflection points – none  

Hence every corresponding answer matches, so the two sets of predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the x–intercept as the point ( −530/21, 0 ).  
The exact value −530/21 = −25.238095…

Candidate 2 gives the x–intercept as −25.24 (no y–coordinate stated, but implicitly y = 0).

To 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: −25.2381  
• Candidate 2: −25.2400

These differ at the third decimal place, so the x-intercepts are not identical per Rule 4.  
Since at least one required sub-answer disagrees, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidate expressions reduce to the same formula:

Candidate 1:  −x / (|x| √(1 − x²))

Candidate 2:  −x / √(x² − x⁴)  
    = −x / √(x²(1 − x²))  
    = −x / (|x| √(1 − x²))

Since they are identical (up to the standard identity √(x²)=|x|), the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates answer both required sub-problems.

Sub-problem 1 (compute f(g(x))):
• Candidate 1: √(2 − x)  
• Candidate 2: √(2 − x)  
Identical.

Sub-problem 2 (compute f(x)/g(x) and give domain):
• Fraction: both give √(x² − 1) / √(3 − x) – identical.  
• Domain:  
  – Candidate 1: “1 ≤ x < 3 or x ≤ −1”, i.e. (−∞, −1] ∪ [1, 3).  
  – Candidate 2: “(−∞, −1] ∪ [1, 3)”.  
  These intervals coincide exactly.

Since every component of both answers matches, the two candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates correspond to different numerical values:

Candidate 1: 1573/90 ≈ 17.4778  
Candidate 2: (13 √13)/9 ≈ 5.20802

They do not match to six significant digits (nor remotely), so the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 supplies  
• radius: “3.95546093 − 2”  (numeric value 1.95546093)  
• height: 3.95546093  

Candidate 2 supplies  
• radius: 1.955 m  
• height: 3.955 m  

Comparing the numerical values (Rule 4, 6-significant-digit test):

Radius:  
  Candidate 1 → 1.95546…  
  Candidate 2 → 1.95500 (interpreting missing digits as zeros)  
The two differ from the 5th significant digit onward.

Height:  
  Candidate 1 → 3.95546…  
  Candidate 2 → 3.95500  
Again they differ from the 5th significant digit onward.

Since both the radius and height fail to match to at least 6 significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by a constant:

1.  Note that  
   2 − 3x = −3(x − 2/3)  ⇒  |2 − 3x| = 3|x − 2/3|.

2.  Compute the difference of the two expressions (ignoring the common −x² + x term):

   D(x) = −(1/3) ln|x − 2/3| + (1/2) ln|1 − 2/(3x)|
          + (1/2) ln|x| − (1/6) ln|2 − 3x|.

   Replace |2 − 3x| by 3|x − 2/3| and collect logarithms:

   D(x) = (1/2) ln[(1 − 2/(3x))·x] − (1/2) ln[3^{1/3}(x − 2/3)]
        = (1/2) ln[(x − 2/3)] − (1/2) ln[3^{1/3}(x − 2/3)]
        = (1/2) ln[3^{−1/3}] = −(1/6) ln 3,

   which is a constant.

Because their difference is just a constant, the two antiderivatives are mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1  
∫ = 1/25 √(6+10x+25x²) + 9/25 ln[1+5x+√(1+(5x+1)²)] + C  

Candidate 2  
∫ = 1/25 √(25x²+10x+6) + 9/25 ln[5x+1+√(25x²+10x+6)] + C  

The first radical terms are identical (just a different order of the summands).  
The logarithmic terms, however, differ:

• Candidate 1 uses √(1+(5x+1)²) = √(25x²+10x+2).  
• Candidate 2 uses √(25x²+10x+6) = √((5x+1)²+5).

Because 25x²+10x+2 ≠ 25x²+10x+6 for general x, the two logarithm arguments are not the same.  
The difference between the two logarithms is not a constant (it depends on x), so the two antiderivatives cannot differ only by an additive constant.

Hence the two expressions are not equivalent.
The two antiderivatives would be equivalent only if they differed by an overall constant independent of x.  
Write

y = 5x + 1.

Candidate 1:  
F₁(x) = (1/25)√(6 + 10x + 25x²) + (9/25) ln[ y + √(1 + y²) ] + C.

Candidate 2 (after rewriting with y):  
F₂(x) = (1/25)√(6 + 10x + 25x²) + (9/25) ln[ (y + √(y² + 5))/√5 ] + C.

Hence the two antiderivatives differ by  
Δ(x) = (9/25) ln [ (y + √(y² + 5))/√5  ÷ ( y + √(1 + y²) ) ].

The factor inside the logarithm depends on y (hence on x); for example, at x = 0, Δ(0) ≈ −0.161, while as x → ∞, Δ(x) → −(9/25) ln√5 ≈ −0.322. Because Δ(x) is not constant, the two expressions are not the same antiderivative.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ in the argument of the logarithm:

• Candidate 1 has ln (1 + 5x + √[1 + (5x + 1)²])  
  → the square-root contains 25x² + 10x + 2.

• Candidate 2 has ln (5x + 1 + √(25x² + 10x + 6)).

Because 25x² + 10x + 2 ≠ 25x² + 10x + 6, the logarithmic terms are not the same.  
The difference between the two antiderivatives therefore depends on x and is not a mere additive constant, so the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: (−∞, −√2) ∪ (2, ∞)

Decreasing:

The two candidates are single real numbers.  
Convert both to a common numeric form rounded (or padded with trailing zeros) to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 755 / 243 ≈ 3.10699588477…  → 3.10700 (rounded to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 3.107 = 3.107000… → 3.10700 (expressed to 6 significant digits)

Since they coincide to six significant digits, the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single numerical value for √[3]{30}.  
Candidate 1: 755/243 ≈ 3.10699588 → 6 significant digits: 3.10699  
Candidate 2: 3.107 → written to 6 significant digits: 3.10700  

Comparing these 6-digit numbers, they first differ at the 4th significant digit (…6… vs …7…).  
According to Rule 4, the answers must match to 6 significant digits to be considered equivalent. They do not, so the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives
F₁(x)=√(x²+1)+½ ln | (√(x²+1)−1)/(√(x²+1)+1) | +C.

Candidate 2 gives
F₂(x)=√(x²+1)+ln ( (√(x²+1)−1)/x ) +C.

To compare, set s=√(1+x²).

Difference (ignoring the common √(1+x²)):
D(x)=ln((s−1)/x)−½ ln((s−1)/(s+1))
     =½ ln((s−1)(s+1))−ln x
     =½ ln(x²)−ln x
     =ln|x|−ln x.

For x>0, ln|x|=ln x, so D(x)=0, hence the two antiderivatives differ only by a constant (indeed the same constant) on the domain x>0.

For x<0, ln x is not defined, so Candidate 2 is not an antiderivative there, while Candidate 1 still is. Thus the two expressions are not equivalent on the whole real line; Candidate 2 is a restricted-domain version.

Since the question did not specify a domain restriction, the two answers are not fully equivalent.

Both candidates express the antiderivative in different trigonometric forms, but after using the identity

sin³(4x) = (3 sin(4x) – sin(12x))/4,

Candidate 2 becomes
3/16 x – 3/128 sin(8x) – 3/128 sin(4x) + 1/128 sin(12x) + C,

which is exactly Candidate 1 (up to an overall additive constant). Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

Both answers are prices in dollars, so the same unit is used.

Convert each answer to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 101/3 = 33.666666… → 33.6667 (6 sig. digits).  
• Candidate 2: 33.67 → 33.6700 (pad with zeros to reach 6 sig. digits).

The two numbers, 33.6667 and 33.6700, differ at the fourth decimal place, so they do not match to six significant digits.

Hence, the two predictions are not equivalent.
Both answers are single numerical prices in dollars.

• Candidate 1: 101/3 ≈ 33.666666…  
  Six significant digits → 33.6667

• Candidate 2: 33.67  
  Six significant digits → 33.6700

Comparing 33.6667 vs 33.6700, the values differ within six significant digits, so they are not equivalent.
The problem asks for a single numerical price (one answer).  

Candidate 1: 101/3 = 33.666666…  
Candidate 2: 33.67 (interpreted as 33.670000 to six significant digits).

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1 → 33.666667  
• Candidate 2 → 33.670000  

Because 33.666667 ≠ 33.670000 at the 6-significant-digit level, the two answers are not identical. Therefore, they are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 coefficient for (x − 1)^n: √3 · C_{1/2}^n · [(x − 1)/3]^n = √3 · (1/3)^n · C_{1/2}^n

For part 2, Candidate 1 writes  
(3 e^{t³} t² + e^{t}) / (e^{t} + e^{x})  
and explicitly states the condition x = t³.  
Under this condition, e^{x} = e^{t³}, so Candidate 1’s denominator becomes e^{t} + e^{t³}, exactly matching Candidate 2’s result  
(3 t² e^{t³} + e^{t}) / (e^{t³} + e^{t}).

Thus, for each sub-problem the two answers are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give the antiderivative in the form  

2x ln(√(2-x)+√(2+x)) − x + 2 arcsin(x/2) + (constant).

Candidate 1 can be rewritten as  
2x ln(√(2-x)+√(2+x)) − (C + x − 2 arcsin(x/2))  
= 2x ln(√(2-x)+√(2+x)) − x + 2 arcsin(x/2) − C,  

and the term “− C” is just another arbitrary integration constant.  
Thus the two expressions differ only by a constant, which is allowed for indefinite integrals. They are therefore equivalent.
Both candidates give the same two solutions, x = −3 and x = 1 (order is irrelevant here). Therefore, their answers are equivalent.

The value represented by Candidate 1 is

(2 / 0.3³) × (0.7⁴ / 4!)  
= 74.074074074 × 0.01000416667  
≈ 0.741049  (to 6 significant digits).

Candidate 2 gives 0.7410, which to 6 significant digits is 0.741000.

Because 0.741049 and 0.741000 do not match to 6 significant digits, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions represent antiderivatives of the same integrand.  
Compute the difference (ignoring the arbitrary constants):

Let S = √(x²+4).

F₁ = S + ln│(S−2)/(S+2)│  
F₂ = S − 2 ln((S+2)/x)

Difference:
Δ = F₁ − F₂  
    = ln│(S−2)/(S+2)│ + 2 ln│(S+2)/x│  
    = ln│(S−2)(S+2) / x²│  
    = ln│(S²−4)/x²│  
    = ln│(x²)/x²│  
    = ln(1) = 0.

Hence F₁ and F₂ differ only by, at most, an additive constant. Therefore the two candidates are equivalent antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both antiderivatives differ only by a constant:

Let S = √(4 + x²).

Candidate 1:  S + ln |(S – 2)/(S + 2)| + C₁  
Candidate 2:  S – 2 ln |(S + 2)/x| + C₂

Difference:

[S + ln |(S – 2)/(S + 2)|] – [S – 2 ln |(S + 2)/x|]
= ln |(S – 2)/(S + 2)| + 2 ln |(S + 2)/x|
= ln |(S – 2)(S + 2)² / (S + 2)x²|
= ln |(S – 2)(S + 2)/x²|
= ln |(S² – 4)/x²|
= ln |x²/x²|
= ln 1 = 0.

Thus the two expressions differ only by an additive constant, meaning they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

while the second candidate gives only the single pair

Although the single pair from Candidate 2 is included in Candidate 1 when k = 0, Candidate 1 contains many additional solutions that Candidate 2 omits. Therefore the two answers are not the same.

Both candidates give the same formulas and the same exact values ( 121/4 π for the area at t = 3 and 11 π for the circumference).  
However, the question also asks for approximate numerical values.  
Rule 4 requires equality to at least 6 significant digits.  

Area at t = 3:  
• Candidate 1: 95.03317777 ⇒ 95.0332 (6 sig figs)  
• Candidate 2: 95.03 ⇒ 95.0300 (6 sig figs)  
Numbers differ (95.0332 ≠ 95.0300).

Circumference at t = 3:  
• Candidate 1: 34.55751919 ⇒ 34.5575  
• Candidate 2: 34.56 ⇒ 34.5600  
Numbers differ (34.5575 ≠ 34.5600).

Because at least one required sub-answer (the approximations) differs beyond the allowed tolerance, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates have the same algebraic term:

(1/12 x² – 5/48 x – 5/96)√(4x²+4x+5)
= (8x² – 10x – 5)/96 · √(4x²+4x+5)

so the first parts coincide exactly.

For the logarithmic part, write A = x + ½ + √(1+(x+½)²).  
Then Candidate 1 has ln A, while Candidate 2 has ln(2A) because

2x+1 + √(4x²+4x+5) = 2[(x+½)+√(1+(x+½)²)] = 2A.

Hence

ln(2A) = ln A + ln 2,

and Candidate 2’s integral equals Candidate 1’s result plus the constant (5/16)·ln 2.  
Since indefinite integrals may differ by an arbitrary constant, the two expressions represent the same antiderivative.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

1. The algebraic (square-root) terms are identical once rewritten with a common denominator:
   (1/12)x² – (5/48)x – (5/96) = (8x² – 10x – 5)/96.

2. For the logarithmic terms,
   Candidate 1: ln(x+½ + √[(x+½)²+1])
   Candidate 2: ln(2x+1 + √{4x²+4x+5})
   but √{4x²+4x+5}=2√[(x+½)²+1], so the argument of Candidate 2 is twice the argument of Candidate 1. Hence
   ln(2k)=ln k+ln 2, giving Candidate 2 = Candidate 1 + (5/16)ln 2, a constant.

Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant, the two expressions represent the same antiderivative.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions can be rewritten to check for equality up to an additive constant.

1. Algebraic ( √ ) term  
   Candidate 1 factor in front of the square-root:
      (1/12)x² − (5/48)x − (5/96)
      = (8x² − 10x − 5)/96.  
   Candidate 2 has exactly (8x² − 10x − 5)/96.  
   Hence the algebraic terms match.

2. Logarithmic term  
   Candidate 1 argument:
      A = x + ½ + ½√(4x² + 4x + 5).

   Candidate 2 argument:
      B = 2x + 1 + √(4x² + 4x + 5)
        = 2(x + ½ + ½√(4x² + 4x + 5))
        = 2A.

   Therefore ln B = ln(2A) = ln 2 + ln A.  
   The extra ln 2 merely adds the constant (5/16)·ln 2 to the whole integral, which is absorbed into the arbitrary constant C.

Since the difference between the candidates is only an additive constant, the two antiderivatives are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give an antiderivative of  

∫ x³ /√(4x²+4x+5) dx.

1. Algebraic (√) term  
   • Candidate 1:
     (1/12 x² − 5/48 x − 5/96) √(4x²+4x+5)  
     = (8x² − 10x − 5)/96 √(4x²+4x+5)

   • Candidate 2:
     (8x² − 10x − 5)/96 √(4x²+4x+5)

   These are identical.

2. Logarithmic term  
   • Candidate 1: (5/16) ln( x+½ + √{1+(x+½)²} )  
     Note √{1+(x+½)²} = ½√(4x²+4x+5).  
     Hence the argument equals ½[ 2x+1+√(4x²+4x+5) ].

   • Candidate 2: (5/16) ln( 2x+1+√(4x²+4x+5) )

   The two logarithms differ only by ln 2:  
        ln(½[2x+1+…]) = ln(2x+1+… ) – ln 2.  
   Multiplying by 5/16, the extra term is (5/16) ln 2, a constant that can be absorbed into the arbitrary integration constant C.

Since their difference is only an additive constant, both expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both candidates give the antiderivative

-(2/√3) arctan [ (1/√3) √((6 − x)/(x − 4)) ] + C,

just written in two algebraically equivalent forms:

1. √(−x²+10x−24) = √((x−4)(6−x))
2. √3 x − 4√3 = √3 (x−4)

Hence

√(−x²+10x−24) / (√3 x − 4√3)
= (1/√3) √((x−4)(6−x)) / (x−4)
= (1/√3) √((6−x)/(x−4)).

So the two antiderivatives differ at most by an additive constant, making them equivalent.

The two antiderivatives can differ by at most an additive constant.

1. Rewrite Candidate 1:
   I₁ = (1/(2√2)) √(4x²+2x−5) − (3/(4√2)) ln|2 + 4√(4x²+2x−5) + 8x| + C

   Factor 8 out of the logarithm’s argument:
   2 + 4√(4x²+2x−5) + 8x = 8[ x + ¼ + ½ √(4x²+2x−5) ].

   Hence
   ln|2 + 4√(4x²+2x−5) + 8x| = ln|8| + ln|x + ¼ + ½ √(4x²+2x−5)|.

   The extra ln|8| term is a constant and can be absorbed into C.

   Also, (1/(2√2)) √(4x²+2x−5) = (√2/4) √(4x²+2x−5)
   and −(3/(4√2)) = −(3√2)/8.

2. Candidate 2 is
   I₂ = (√2/4) √(4x²+2x−5) − (3√2)/8 ln|x + ¼ + ½ √(4x²+2x−5)| + C.

3. After the above simplifications, I₁ = I₂ + constant.

Therefore Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 represent the same antiderivative up to an additive constant.

Both candidates give the first three non-zero Maclaurin terms for tan x:

Candidate 1: x + (2/6)x³ + (16/120)x⁵ + … = x + (1/3)x³ + (2/15)x⁵ + …

Candidate 2: x + (1/3)x³ + (2/15)x⁵

The coefficients match exactly, and the ellipsis in Candidate 1 does not alter the equivalence for the requested first three terms. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 2:  -∑ₙ₌₀^∞ [ (n+2)(n+1) / 2 ] xⁿ

Pulling the minus sign outside or leaving it inside the summand makes no mathematical difference. Thus, the two series are identical.

The question asks for a “maximum percentage error,” so the natural unit is percent (%).

Candidate 2 explicitly states “10 %.”
Candidate 1 gives “0.1” with no percent sign.

Because 0.1 could reasonably be interpreted either as
• 0.1 % (if the reader keeps the unit “percent” implicit), or
• 0.1 (i.e., a fractional value equal to 10 %),
the omission of the percent sign creates ambiguity. Per Rule 1, when a missing unit can lead to multiple reasonable interpretations, the two answers are not considered equivalent.

Hence the two candidates are NOT equivalent.

Candidate 1: ln[(1 + √(1−x²)) / |x|] + C  
Candidate 2: ln[(1 + √(1−x²)) / x] + C  

The only difference is that Candidate 1 uses |x| in the denominator whereas Candidate 2 uses x itself.

For x > 0, |x| = x, so both expressions coincide up to the same constant.

For x < 0 (still within the domain −1 < x < 0), the ratio in Candidate 2 is negative, hence its natural logarithm is undefined in the real domain. Candidate 1, using |x|, remains well-defined and real. Therefore the two expressions do not define the same real antiderivative on the entire domain of the integrand. They are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s antiderivative is  

C + ln[(1 + √(1 – x²)) / |x|].

Candidate 2’s antiderivative is  

ln[(1 + √(1 – x²)) / x] + C.

The two differ in that Candidate 1 uses |x| in the denominator whereas Candidate 2 uses x.  
For x > 0, |x| = x, so the expressions match up to an additive constant.  
For x < 0, however, |x| = –x, so Candidate 1’s logarithm argument remains positive, while Candidate 2’s argument becomes negative (and hence not defined in the real logarithm). Thus the two antiderivatives are not the same on the full real domain where the integrand is defined.

Candidate 1 gives the curvature as  
κ₁(t) = 1 / [40 · |sin(t/2)|].

Candidate 2 gives  
κ₂(t) = 1 / [40 · sin(t/2)].

These two expressions differ by the presence of an absolute-value sign. Since sin(t/2) can be negative for many values of t, κ₂(t) can be negative or even undefined where sin(t/2)=0, whereas κ₁(t) is always non-negative (aside from the same undefined points). Therefore the two answers are not mathematically equivalent.
The two expressions differ:  

• Candidate 1 has 1 / [40 · |sin(t⁄2)|]  
• Candidate 2 has 1 / [40 · sin(t⁄2)]

Because the absolute-value bars are present in Candidate 1 but absent in Candidate 2, the two formulas give different (and sometimes opposite-sign) results whenever sin(t⁄2) is negative. Therefore they are not equivalent.

The two proposed formulas describe the same exponential function:

Candidate 1: f(x) = (1/8)·2^x

Both candidates provide the same single exponential formula:

• Candidate 1:  f(x) = (1/8)·2^x  
• Candidate 2:  y = (1/8)·2^x

The only difference is the dependent-variable symbol (f(x) versus y); mathematically these denote the identical function. All other components (coefficient 1/8 and base 2) match exactly, and the question requires just one equation. Thus, by Rule 8 (same mathematical object despite notational variation) the answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give five answers, matching the required count.  
Numerical values agree (6, 4, 6, 500, 9).  

However, Candidate 1 omits the numerator unit in four of the five rates (“per person/hour/minute” without specifying slices, votes, km, bags).  
According to Rule 1, if a unit omission causes ambiguity, the answers are considered inequivalent.  
Candidate 2 explicitly includes all numerator units, while Candidate 1 does not, leaving the type of quantity unclear.

Therefore the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates give the same numerical values for every sub-problem, but Candidate 1 omits the “what” units (slices, votes, km, bags) in several answers, writing only “4 per person”, “6 per hour”, “500 per hour”, and “9 per minute”.  
According to Rule 1, if omission of a unit creates ambiguity, the answers are not considered equivalent. Because Candidate 2 explicitly supplies all required units (slices, votes, km, bags) while Candidate 1 does not, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:  (10 – 55√2)/238

   • Candidate 2: ∑ (12·2ⁿ – 10) xⁿ

The problem asks for the pair(s) of consecutive even numbers whose product is 624.  There are two such pairs: (24, 26) and (-26, ‑24).

Candidate 1 lists the four numbers 24, 26, ‑24, ‑26.  
Candidate 2 lists the same four numbers, grouped explicitly into the two pairs “24 and 26” and “-26 and ‑24”.

Candidate 2 is
−(x²+9)^{7/2}/(1701 x⁷) + 2(x²+9)^{5/2}/(1215 x⁵) − (x²+9)^{3/2}/(729 x³) + C.

Both candidates give the two intersection points in terms of m.  

• Candidate 2’s y–coordinates contain the factor m, so their sign follows the sign of m.  
• Candidate 1’s y–coordinates contain |m| (because √(m²)=|m|), so their y–values are always non-negative for the first point and non-positive for the second point, regardless of the sign of m.  

When m < 0, these y–coordinates differ in sign, so the two sets of points are not identical. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 2 gives the intersection points as  
( 2 / √(1+m²), 2m / √(1+m²) ) and ( −2 / √(1+m²), −2m / √(1+m²) ).

Candidate 1 gives  
( √[4/(1+m²)], √[4m²/(1+m²)] ) and ( −√[4/(1+m²)], −√[4m²/(1+m²)] ).

Observe that
√[4/(1+m²)] = 2/√(1+m²), so the x-coordinates match.

For the y-coordinates:
√[4m²/(1+m²)] = 2|m|/√(1+m²), i.e., it is always non-negative.  
Thus, for m < 0 the first point in Candidate 1 has a positive y-value, whereas the correct value 2m/√(1+m²) is negative; similarly, the second point’s y-value in Candidate 1 becomes negative while the correct one −2m/√(1+m²) is positive. Hence Candidate 1’s points coincide with the true intersection points only when m ≥ 0 (and m=0), but differ when m < 0.

Since the two sets of points are not identical for all real m, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.  
For m < 0 the y–coordinates in Candidate 1 (which use |m|) have the wrong sign, so its listed points do not satisfy y = m x, whereas Candidate 2’s points do. Hence the point sets differ.

The numbers differ (–1.00000 × 10⁶ vs –9.81000 × 10⁶). They do not match to 6 significant digits (or to any reasonable tolerance), so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of  

∫ sin²x cosx /(sinx + cosx) dx.

Write candidate 1 (dropping the explicit “+ C”) as

(1/4)[ln(1+tan x)+ln|cos x|] − (1/4)(1+tan x)cos²x.

Note that (1+tan x)cos²x = (1 + sinx/cosx)cos²x = (sinx + cosx)cosx,
so the algebraic (non-logarithmic) part equals −(sinx cosx + cos²x)/4, which is
exactly the corresponding part in candidate 2.

For the logarithmic part, observe

ln(1+tan x) + ln|cos x|
= ln[(1+tan x)|cos x|]
= ln[(sinx+cosx) · sign(cos x)]
= ln|sinx + cosx|,

because (1+tan x) = (sinx+cosx)/cosx and multiplying by |cosx| contributes the
sign(cos x), giving |sinx+cosx|.  Thus the logarithmic terms in both
candidates coincide up to the usual additive constant that is immaterial for an
indefinite integral.

Hence, apart from a possible overall constant of integration, both
expressions represent the same antiderivative.

The two antiderivatives can be rewritten into the same form.

1. Candidate 1  
   • Log part:  
      (1/4)[ln(1+tan x)+ln|cos x|]   
      = (1/4) ln[(1+tan x) cos x]  
      Since 1+tan x = (sin x+cos x)/cos x,  
      (1+tan x) cos x = sin x+cos x.  
      So the log term is (1/4) ln|sin x+cos x|.

   • Algebraic part:  
      −(1/4)(1+tan x) cos²x  
      = −(1/4) [(sin x+cos x)/cos x] cos²x  
      = −(1/4) (sin x+cos x) cos x.

   • Therefore Candidate 1 = (1/4) ln|sin x+cos x| − (1/4) cos x (sin x+cos x) + C.

2. Candidate 2 is already (1/4) ln|sin x+cos x| − (1/4) cos x (sin x+cos x) + C.

They differ only by an arbitrary constant C, hence they are equivalent antiderivatives.

The two derivatives are not the same.  
If we write both candidates in the common form

  y′ = y · ( … ),

the multiplier given by Candidate 1 equals  
(50x³ + 35x² + 14x + 10)/(30x⁴ + 20x³ + 12x² + 8x),

whereas Candidate 2’s multiplier equals  
(100x³ + 70x² + 14x + 10)/(60x⁴ + 40x³ + 12x² + 8x).

Evaluating at, for example, x = 1 gives 109/70 ≈ 1.557 for Candidate 1 and 194/120 ≈ 1.617 for Candidate 2, so the expressions are different. Therefore the two answers are inequivalent.

Both candidates give algebraic expressions for dy/dx.  
Starting from Candidate 1,

y' = −y² / [2(x² − y²) − x y]  
  = −y² / [2(x−y)(x+y) − x y]

From the implicit relation 3(x + y) = 4y⁴(x − y), substitute (x + y):

2(x−y)(x+y) = 2(x−y)·(4y⁴(x−y)/3) = 8y⁴(x−y)² / 3.

Hence

denominator = 8y⁴(x−y)² / 3 − x y  
  = [8y⁴(x−y)² − 3x y]/3.

Therefore  
y' = −3y² / [8y⁴(x−y)² − 3x y]  
  = 3y / [3x − 8y³(x−y)²],

which is exactly Candidate 2 (up to the obvious factor y ≠ 0 required by both expressions).

Since the two forms are algebraically identical under the given implicit relation, the candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates give algebraic expressions for dy/dx.  
Comparing them:

Candidate 1: y′ = − y² / [2(x² − y²) − xy]

Candidate 2: y′ = 3y / [3x − 8y³(x − y)²]

These two expressions are generally different, but on the curve defined by the implicit relation

 2y⁴ − (3x + 3y)/(2x − 2y) = 0

one has the identity y⁴ = 3(x + y)/[4(x − y)], which implies

 4y⁴(x − y) = 3(x + y).

Using this relation turns the denominator–numerator combination of Candidate 1 into exactly that of Candidate 2 (up to the common factor −1 that is likewise canceled), showing that the two derivative formulas coincide everywhere on the given curve.

Hence, the two candidate answers are mathematically equivalent for the implicit function in question.

Both candidates list three zeros:

Candidate 1:  −2,  +i√(3/2),  −i√(3/2)  
Candidate 2:  −2,  +i√6/2,  −i√6/2

Note that
√(3/2) = √3 / √2 = √(3·2) / 2 = √6 / 2.

Thus i√(3/2) = i√6/2 and −i√(3/2) = −i√6/2.  
Hence each root in Candidate 1 matches exactly a root in Candidate 2, and both lists contain the same three values (order is irrelevant here).

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates simplify to the same expression (up to the arbitrary integration constant):

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
(6x)^{2/3} − 5(6x)^{1/3} + 5 ln|1 + (6x)^{1/3}| − 6 arctan((6x)^{1/6}) + C.

Candidate 2 is  
(36x²)^{1/3} − 5(6x)^{1/3} + 5 ln(1 + (6x)^{1/3}) − 6 arctan((6x)^{1/6}) + C,

and (36x²)^{1/3} = (6x)^{2/3}.  
The only apparent difference is the absolute-value bars in the logarithm, which change the expression by at most a constant where the integral is defined (x > 0). That falls within the arbitrary constant of integration.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

First compare each sub-answer required by the problem.

1. Concave-up interval(s)  
   • Candidate 1:  (-2, 0) ∪ (0, ∞)  (excludes the single point x = 0)  
   • Candidate 2:  (-2, ∞)            (includes x = 0)

   These two sets differ by the point {0}. Hence they are not identical.

2. Concave-down interval(s)  
   Both give (-∞, -2); they match.

3. Point(s) of inflection  
   Both give (-2, 44); they match.

Because the concave-up answers are not the same, the overall sets of answers are not identical. According to Rule 2, any discrepancy in one required sub-answer makes the candidates inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates differ in their description of the interval where the function is concave up.

• Candidate 1 lists the concave-up set as the union (−2, 0) ∪ (0, ∞), explicitly excluding x = 0.  
• Candidate 2 lists it as (−2, ∞), which includes x = 0.

Since the two answers disagree on whether x = 0 is included in the concave-up interval, the candidates’ predictions are not identical. All other parts match, but Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to be exactly the same for equivalence.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the antiderivative as

(8x² – 10x – 1)√(x² + x + 1) / 24  +  (7/16) ln|x + ½ + √(x² + x + 1)| + C,

since Candidate 1’s prefactor
(1/3)x² – (5/12)x – 1/24
equals
(8x² – 10x – 1)/24
after putting everything over the common denominator 24.  
The logarithm parts match (the absolute‐value bars in Candidate 1 do not change anything because the argument is always positive).

Thus the two answers differ at most by an additive constant, so they are equivalent.

Candidate 1 simplifies as follows:

[(sin x)² + x sin x cos x − 2x (sin x)² − cos x] / sin x  
= sin x + x cos x − 2x sin x − cot x.

Candidate 2 is

sin x + x cos x − 2x sin x + cot x.

The two results are identical except for the cot x term, which has opposite sign. Since −cot x ≠ +cot x in general, the two derivatives are not the same.

Both answers describe the same subset of ℝ.

Per 2π-period:

• Candidate 1 keeps the closed interval  
  [−π/6 + 2πk , 7π/6 + 2πk].

• Candidate 2 keeps everything except the open interval  
  (7π/6 + 2πk , 11π/6 + 2πk).

Modulo 2π, Candidate 1’s interval [−π/6 , 7π/6] equals the union  
[11π/6 , 2π] ∪ [0 , 7π/6], which is exactly the complement of the open gap
(7π/6 , 11π/6) specified by Candidate 2.  
Endpoints 7π/6 and 11π/6 are included in both descriptions.

Thus the two sets coincide for every integer k.

Both answers describe the same set of real numbers:

• Candidate 2 removes every open interval  
  ( 7π/6 + 2kπ,  11π/6 + 2kπ ),  
so the remaining (allowed) part of the line is exactly  
  [ 11π/6 + 2π(k−1),  7π/6 + 2kπ ] = [ −π/6 + 2kπ,  7π/6 + 2kπ ].

Σ_{n=0}^∞ [(-1)^n /(n+1)] x^{2n+2}  
Let m = n+1 ⇒ (-1)^{m-1}/m · x^{2m}, m = 1,2,…  

Candidate 2:  
Σ_{n=1}^∞ [(-1)^{n-1}/n] x^{2n}  

Thus both are Σ_{k=1}^∞ (-1)^{k-1}/k · x^{2k}. The candidates are equivalent.

The expressions to compare are:

Candidate 1:  
C + ¼ · sin(2x)/(cos(2x))² + ¼ · ln|tan(x + π/4)|

Candidate 2:  
¼ · sec(2x) tan(2x) + ¼ · ln|sec(2x) + tan(2x)| + C

1. Note that  
   sin(2x)/(cos(2x))² = sec(2x) tan(2x).  
   So their first (non-constant) terms are identical.

2. There is the trigonometric identity  
   sec θ + tan θ = tan(π/4 + θ/2).  
   Putting θ = 2x gives  
   sec(2x) + tan(2x) = tan(x + π/4).

   Therefore ln|sec(2x) + tan(2x)| = ln|tan(x + π/4)| exactly.

Since each non-constant term in Candidate 1 matches the corresponding term in Candidate 2 (and both include an arbitrary constant of integration), the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by a constant—and are thus equivalent.

4. 2π/3 + 2π ℤ
5. 4π/3 + 2π ℤ   (since −2π/3 + 2π n = 4π/3 + 2π (n−1))

Candidate 1’s compact form “(−1)^n π/6 + π n” generates both π/6 + 2π ℤ and 5π/6 + 2π ℤ, so no solutions are missing or extra.

Hence the two candidate answers are mathematically identical.

After rewriting both antiderivatives with the common denominator sin⁸(6x),

• Candidate 1 gives  
 F₁(x)=−[c⁸/108 + (2 c⁶ s²)/81 + (c⁴ s⁴)/54] · 1/sin⁸(6x),

• Candidate 2 gives  
 F₂(x)=−1/(108 sin⁸(6x)) + 1/(81 sin⁶(6x))  
    = [−1/108 + s²/81] · 1/sin⁸(6x),

where s = sin(6x) and c = cos(6x).

Subtracting, F₁−F₂ has numerator  
−c⁸/108 − (2 c⁶ s²)/81 − (c⁴ s⁴)/54 + 1/108 − s²/81,  
which simplifies (using c² = 1−s²) to a non-zero polynomial in s²; it is not a constant.  
Therefore F₁ and F₂ are not the same up to an additive constant.

Hence the two candidate answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers are antiderivatives of the same integrand, so they may differ by at most an additive constant.  
Expanding Candidate 1 shows

C₁(x)  
= C − (2/27)[(1/3)cot⁶(6x) + (1/4)cot⁴(6x) + (1/8)cot⁸(6x)]  
= C′ − 1/(108 sin⁸(6x)) + 1/(81 sin⁶(6x)),

where C′ is a new constant (obtained after combining the constant terms in the expansion).

Candidate 2 is exactly

C₂(x) = −1/(108 sin⁸(6x)) + 1/(81 sin⁶(6x)) + C.

Thus C₁(x) and C₂(x) differ only by an (inessential) constant. Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates give the antiderivative  

(x − 5) √((x+1)/(x−1))  +  logarithmic part

and only the form of the logarithmic term looks different.

Using A = √(x−1), B = √(x+1), √(x²−1)=AB,

ln | (A−B)/(A+B) |  
= ½ ln( (A−B)²/(A+B)² )  
= ½ ln( (x−AB)/(x+AB) )  
= ½[ln(x−√(x²−1)) − ln(x+√(x²−1))].

Hence  

−3 ln | (A−B)/(A+B) |  
= −(3/2)ln(x−√(x²−1)) + (3/2)ln(x+√(x²−1)).

Comparing with Candidate 2’s +3 ln(x+√(x²−1)), the difference between the two logarithmic expressions is  

(3/2)[ln(x+√(x²−1)) + ln(x−√(x²−1))]  
= (3/2)ln[(x+√(x²−1))(x−√(x²−1))]  
= (3/2)ln 1  
= 0.

Therefore, the two entire antiderivatives differ only by an overall constant (in fact, they coincide exactly up to the arbitrary “+ C”). Hence the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

Both antiderivatives can be rewritten in the same form:

1.  Rewrite the “algebraic” part of Candidate 1  
   √((x+1)/(x-1))(x-5)
   = (x-5)(x+1)/√(x²-1)
   = [x² − 4x − 5]/√(x²-1),

   which is exactly the first two terms of Candidate 2:  
   √(x²-1) − 4(x+1)/√(x²-1) = [x² − 4x − 5]/√(x²-1).

2.  For the logarithmic part, the identity  
   ln | (√(x−1) − √(x+1)) / (√(x−1) + √(x+1)) | = − ln (x + √(x²−1))
   shows that  
   −3 ln| … |  =  3 ln(x + √(x²−1)),

   matching the logarithmic term of Candidate 2 up to a constant.

Since both expressions differ at most by an additive constant (indeed, here not even that), the two candidates represent the same antiderivative.

Candidate 2 states exactly  
5x/128 − sin³(6x)/144 − sin(12x)/384 − sin(24x)/3072 + C

Aside from the order of the addends (which is immaterial) they are identical up to an overall constant of integration.

Both answers are antiderivatives and can differ at most by a constant.  
Rewriting Candidate 1:

1. Combine x-terms: 1/32 x + 1/128 x = 5/128 x  
2. Rewrite sin(6x)³ by the identity sin³θ = (3 sin θ − sin 3θ)/4:
   −(1/144) sin³(6x) = −(1/144)·(3 sin 6x − sin 18x)/4  
   = −3/(576) sin 6x + 1/(576) sin 18x  
   = −1/192 sin 6x + 1/576 sin 18x

After these steps, Candidate 1 becomes
5/128 x − 1/192 sin 6x − 1/384 sin 12x + 1/576 sin 18x − 1/3072 sin 24x + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2 (up to the constant of integration).

The two candidates state different conditions:

• Candidate 1: |p| < 1/2  ⇒  −1/2 < p < 1/2  
• Candidate 2: p < 1/2  ⇒  p can be any real number less than 1/2 (no upper bound on how negative p can be).

Since these two sets of p-values are not the same, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The quantity p is defined in the problem as  

 p = limₙ→∞ |a_{n+1}/a_n|,  

so p cannot be negative (it is the limit of absolute‐values).  
Hence the only admissible values for p lie in [0, ∞).

• Candidate 1 states |p| < 1/2, which on the real line means −1/2 < p < 1/2.  
• Candidate 2 states p < 1/2.

Restricting to the feasible domain p ≥ 0, both conditions reduce to exactly the same requirement: 0 ≤ p < 1/2.  
Therefore, in the context of the problem (where negative p values are impossible), the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates provide an antiderivative for the same integrand; the two expressions differ at most by an additive constant.  
Numerical checks at several values of x (e.g., x = 0 and x = 1) show that the two formulas return the same value (up to rounding error), meaning their difference is constant. Therefore the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give antiderivatives of the same integrand.  
After rewriting Candidate 1,

1/(e^{3x}+√(1+e^{6x})) = √(1+e^{6x}) − e^{3x},

so the term  
−(2/3)/(e^{3x}+√(1+e^{6x})) equals (2/3)(e^{3x} − √(1+e^{6x})), matching the first two terms of Candidate 2.

For the logarithmic parts, let  
A = e^{3x}, B = √(1+A²), K = A+B.

Candidate 1 has −(2/3) ln((K−1)/(K+1)), while Candidate 2 has −(1/3) ln((B−1)/(B+1)).  
Using B²−A² = 1 and K = A+B, one finds

(B−1)/(B+1) = ((K−1)/(K+1))²,

so

−(1/3) ln((B−1)/(B+1)) = −(2/3) ln((K−1)/(K+1)),

which is exactly the logarithmic term in Candidate 1 up to a constant. Hence the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by an additive constant.

Therefore the results are mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives an antiderivative whose derivative equals  
 −2 / (e^{3x}+√(1+e^{6x})), so it matches the integrand.  
Candidate 2’s derivative is 2 e^{3x} − 2√(1+e^{6x}), which is not the given integrand.  
Thus the two expressions cannot differ only by an additive constant and are not equivalent.

The question asks for the dollar amounts invested in each of three accounts (4 %, 3 %, and 2 %).  
Both candidates provide all three required numbers, with the same values:

• 4 % account: \$75,000  
• 3 % account: \$15,000  
• 2 % account: \$10,000  

The ordering and units (dollars) are consistent in both answers. Therefore, the two candidates’ predictions are identical.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 disagree on the concave-down interval.

• Candidate 1: concave down on (−∞, −2) ∪ (−2, 0)  (excludes x = −2).  
• Candidate 2: concave down on (−∞, 0)  (includes x = −2).

Because their listed sets differ at x = −2, the two answers are not identical for sub-problem 2. Hence the overall predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The answers must match for every sub-part (concave-up region, concave-down region, inflection point).

Concave up:
• Both candidates give (0, ∞) → match.

Concave down:
• Candidate 1: (-∞, -2) ∪ (-2, 0)  (this excludes x = -2)
• Candidate 2: (-∞, 0)  (this includes x = -2)

Because one candidate includes the point x = -2 while the other excludes it, the concave-down sets are not identical. Hence the overall answers are not equivalent.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Reasoning:

Sub-problem 1 (concave-up interval):  
Both candidates give (0, ∞).  → agree.

Sub-problem 2 (concave-down interval):  
• Candidate 1: (−∞, −2) ∪ (−2, 0) (excludes x = −2).  
• Candidate 2: (−∞, 0) (includes x = −2).  
The two sets differ at the single point x = −2, so they are not identical.

Sub-problem 3 (inflection point): both give (0, 100).

Because there is a discrepancy in the concave-down interval, the two answers are not equivalent according to Rule 2.

The question asks for a single numerical answer: the annual interest rate (in percent).  
Both candidates give a percentage, so units are the same.

• Candidate 2: 4.4926 % → 4.49260 (six significant digits)

The fifth significant digit differs (0 vs 6), so the two numbers are not identical to six significant digits.

• Candidate 2 sine coefficient:  
  8 n (−1)ⁿ sinh(2π) / [π (n²+4)]

Candidate 1 gives (0.8351, 0.6974).  
Candidate 2 gives (0.835, 0.697).

Using Rule 4, we must compare each numerical component to 6 significant digits.  
Treating missing digits as zeros, Candidate 1’s x-coordinate is 0.835100… while Candidate 2’s is 0.835000…; they already differ at the 4th decimal place.  
The same discrepancy exists for the y-coordinate (0.697400… vs 0.697000…).

Since they do not match to 6 significant digits, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that, after simplification, differ only by an additive constant:

• Candidate 1 simplifies to  
 F₁(x) = – 4 / (3 sin 3x) + 2⁄3 tan 3x · sec 3x + ln|(1+sin 3x)/(1–sin 3x)| + C

• Candidate 2 is  
 F₂(x) = – 4 / (3 sin 3x) + 2⁄3 tan 3x · sec 3x + 2 ln|sec 3x + tan 3x| + C

Using the identity sec x + tan x = (1+sin x)/cos x, one gets  
2 ln|sec x + tan x| = ln|(1+sin x)/(1–sin x)|, so the logarithmic terms are identical up to a constant.  
All other terms match exactly.

Hence the two expressions are equivalent antiderivatives (they differ only by a constant).

Set k = n + 1 ⇒ n = k − 1:
(−1)^{n+1} (2n + 1) x^{2n} / (2n + 3)!

Candidate 1 includes the absolute-value bars, guaranteeing the log argument is positive on the whole real domain where √(x²+8x) is real (x ≤ −8 or x ≥ 0).  
Candidate 2 omits the absolute value, so for x ≤ −8 the argument of the logarithm is negative and the expression becomes undefined (or complex). Therefore the two antiderivatives are not the same function on the natural real domain; they cannot differ merely by an additive constant everywhere.

Both candidates present antiderivatives of the integrand.  
Computing the difference

F₁(x) = (1/42) cot⁴(10x) + (1/63) cot⁶(10x)  
F₂(x) = 1/(63 sin⁶(10x)) – 1/(42 sin⁴(10x))

gives

F₁(x) – F₂(x) ≡ 1/126,

a constant independent of x.

Both antiderivatives can be rewritten to match:

Candidate 1  
C + [sin x / (2(sin²x – 1))] + (3/4) ln|sin x – 1| – (3/4) ln|1 + sin x| + 1/ sin x

•  sin²x – 1 = –cos²x, so sin x/[2(sin²x – 1)] = –sin x/(2 cos²x) = –½ sec x tan x  
•  1/sin x = csc x  
•  ln|sin x – 1| = ln|1 – sin x| (absolute value)  

Hence Candidate 1 simplifies to  
csc x – ½ sec x tan x + (3/4) ln| (1 – sin x)/(1 + sin x) | + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2.

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent up to an additive constant (allowed for antiderivatives).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions can be rewritten into the same form:

Candidate 1  
C + (−½) sec x tan x + csc x − (¾) ln| (1 + sin x)/(1 − sin x) |

Candidate 2  
csc x − (¾) ln| (1 + sin x)/(1 − sin x) | − ½ sec x tan x + C

These differ only by a rearrangement of terms and the arbitrary constant of integration. Hence they are equivalent antiderivatives.

The two candidates are not equivalent:

• Both give the same constant term, but their cosine / sine terms have different arguments:  
  – Candidate 1 uses cos(n x) and sin(n x)  
  – Candidate 2 uses cos(n x / 2) and sin(n x / 2)

• Because of this frequency difference, the two series represent different periodic extensions and cannot be the same Fourier series.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different trigonometric bases and different coefficient factors.

• Candidate 1 uses cos(n x) and sin(n x), which corresponds to a fundamental period 2π.  
• Candidate 2 uses cos(n x / 2) and sin(n x / 2), which corresponds to the required period 4π.

Because the arguments of the sine and cosine terms differ by a factor of 2, the two series cannot represent the same periodic extension. Their overall coefficient factors (proportional to sinh (4π)) are also scaled differently. Hence the two answers are not the same Fourier series.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not the same.

Key difference:
• Candidate 1 has trigonometric terms  cos(n x) and sin(n x).  
• Candidate 2 has trigonometric terms  cos(n x / 2) and sin(n x / 2).

Those angular arguments differ by a factor of 2, so the series represent different sets of basis functions (different frequencies) for a given period. Because of this mismatch the two Fourier-series representations cannot be equivalent.

(x + 6)(x − 6) = x² − 36  

Thus

72·(x − 1)(x + 1) / ((x + 6)(x − 6)) = 72(x² − 1)/(x² − 36)

Since (x − 1)(x + 1) = x² − 1 and (x + 6)(x − 6) = x² − 36, the two forms are algebraically identical.

Candidate 1 writes

Candidate 2 writes  
 e^{-x} = [sinh π / π] + [2 sinh π / π] Σ_{n=1}^∞ (-1)^n/(1+n²)·(cos nx + n sin nx)

Because sinh π = (e^π − e^{-π})/2, set A = (e^π − e^{-π})/(2π). Then:

• Candidate 1: constant term = A/2, coefficients = A·(-1)^n/(1+n²) etc.  
• Candidate 2: constant term = A, coefficients = 2A·(-1)^n/(1+n²) etc.

The constant term and every Fourier coefficient differ by a factor of 2. Therefore the two series are not identical; the answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for all common tangents (multiple answers).  

• Candidate 1 lists four distinct tangent‐line equations.  
• Candidate 2 gives only one equation (y = –2x – 5).

Since Candidate 2 omits three of the required lines, the two candidate answers are not the same.

The question asks for  
• the local minimum value(s) and  
• the local maximum value(s).  

Candidate 1 explicitly assigns:  
– local minima:  –4 and –516  
– local maximum:  24  

Candidate 2 simply lists the three numbers –516, 24, –4 without indicating which are minima and which is the maximum.  
Because the problem has two distinct sub-answers (minimum vs. maximum), Rule 2 requires that each candidate give a clear answer for each sub-problem. Candidate 2 does not label which values correspond to which sub-problem, so its response is ambiguous/incomplete relative to Candidate 1’s explicitly categorized answer. Therefore the two answers are not considered equivalent.
Candidate 1 lists two local minimum values (–4, –516) and one local maximum value (24), giving the corresponding x-coordinates as well.  
Candidate 2 lists exactly the same two minimum values (–4, –516) and the same maximum value (24), just without the x-coordinates.

Since the question requests only the values of the local minima and maxima, both candidates supply the same required values; the extra coordinate information in Candidate 1 does not create a discrepancy. Thus the answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by algebraic simplification of logarithmic terms, and their difference equals zero (a constant). Therefore, the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same algebraic term  −x²/2.

For the logarithmic part:

1. Candidate 1:
   −2 ln|x²−2x−3|  − ln|(x−3)/(x+1)|  
   = −2[ln|x−3|+ln|x+1|] − [ln|x−3|−ln|x+1|]  
   = −3 ln|x−3| − ln|x+1|.

2. Candidate 2 already writes −3 ln|x−3| − ln|x+1|.

Thus, after simplification Candidate 1 matches Candidate 2 up to an additive constant of integration.

Both candidates represent antiderivatives of the integrand.  
Expressing Candidate 2 in terms of \(t = \tan \frac{x}{2}\) gives

F₂(t) =  
\(-\frac{1-t^{2}}{64t^{4}}-\frac{1}{8t^{2}}+\frac18t^{2}+\frac{1}{64}t^{4}+\frac38\ln|t|+C\).

Candidate 1 is

F₁(t) =  
\(\frac18 t^{2}+\frac38\ln|t|+\frac{1}{64}t^{4}-\frac18 t^{-2}-\frac{1}{64}t^{-4}+C\).

After arranging the terms of F₂(t) in the same order, the two expressions are identical term-by-term, differing at most by an additive constant. Hence the two antiderivatives are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions can be rewritten with the half-angle substitution t = tan(x/2):

• Candidate 1 becomes  
 t⁴/64 + t²/8 – 1/(8 t²) – 1/(64 t⁴) + (3/8) ln|t| + C.

• Candidate 2 simplifies to exactly the same algebraic part  
 t⁴/64 + t²/8 – 1/(8 t²) – 1/(64 t⁴)  
and its logarithmic term  
 –(3/8) ln|csc x + cot x|  
equals (3/8) ln|tan(x/2)| because csc x + cot x = cot(x/2) = 1/tan(x/2).

Thus the two antiderivatives differ at most by an additive constant; they are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates provide antiderivatives for  

∫ csc⁵x dx = ∫ 1/ sin⁵x dx.

1.  Candidate 2  
   Differentiate  
   F₂(x) = −¼ cot x csc³x − ⅜ cot x csc x − ⅜ ln|csc x+cot x|.  
   A direct differentiation (using d/dx cot x = −csc²x and d/dx csc x = −csc x cot x) gives  
   F₂′(x) = csc⁵x,  
   so Candidate 2 is a correct antiderivative.

2.  Candidate 1  
   Let t = tan(x/2).  Write the answer as  
   F₁(t) = t²/8 + 3/8 ln|t| + t⁴/64 − 1/(8t²) − 1/(64t⁴).  
   Because dt/dx = ½(1+t²),  
   F₁′(x) = ½(1+t²) F₁′(t) = (1+t²)⁵ /(32 t⁵) = csc⁵x,  
   so Candidate 1 is also a correct antiderivative.

Since both expressions differentiate to exactly the integrand, they represent the same family of antiderivatives and therefore differ at most by an additive constant. Hence the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions:

Candidate 2: 1 / [48 · sin(t/2)]

Candidate 1 takes the absolute value of sin(t/2), guaranteeing a non-negative result, while Candidate 2 does not. For values of t where sin(t/2) is negative, the two expressions have opposite signs. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives

Because κ₂ lacks the absolute–value bars, κ₂ changes sign whenever sin(t/2) is negative, whereas κ₁ is always non-negative. Hence the two expressions are not mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates list two families of zeros.

Family 1  
• Candidate 1: x = –π/4 + π n  
• Candidate 2: x = 3π/4 + π k  

Since 3π/4 = –π/4 + π, we have  
3π/4 + π k = –π/4 + π(k+1).  
As k runs over all integers, k+1 also runs over all integers. Hence the two expressions represent the same set of points.

Family 2  
• Candidate 1: x = arctan(1/2) + π n  
• Candidate 2: x = arctan(1/2) + π k  

These are obviously identical (just different dummy integer symbols).

Thus each family in Candidate 1 matches exactly the corresponding family in Candidate 2, so the overall solution sets are identical.

Both expressions can be rewritten in the same form.

Candidate 1:
x² = π²/3 – 4 ( cos x/1² – cos 2x/2² + cos 3x/3² – … )
        = π²/3 – 4 ∑_{n=1}^∞ (–1)^{n+1} cos(nx)/n²
        = π²/3 + 4 ∑_{n=1}^∞ (–1)^n cos(nx)/n².

Candidate 2:
π²/3 + 4 ∑_{n=1}^∞ (–1)^n cos(nx)/n².

Thus, after simplifying Candidate 1, both candidates give exactly the same Fourier series.

Both candidates conclude that the series does not converge:

• Candidate 2: “The series diverges.”

Since both indicate divergence, the answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates describe the same polar region.

• For Candidate 1: θ ∈ [3π/2, 5π/2] and 0 ≤ r ≤ 4 cos θ.  Because angles are periodic with period 2π, [3π/2, 5π/2] is equivalent to the union of 270°–360° and 0°–90°, i.e. θ where cos θ ≥ 0.

• For Candidate 2: θ ∈ [0, 2π] and 0 ≤ r ≤ 4 cos θ.  On portions of this θ–interval where cos θ < 0 (π/2 < θ < 3π/2), the upper bound for r is negative, so the r–interval is empty there; effectively only the same θ where cos θ ≥ 0 contribute, namely 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 and 3π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 2π—the same set obtained from Candidate 1.

Hence both candidates produce exactly the same set of points in the plane.

 = − 3/8 · (1 + 4 tan²x) · tan^{−8/3}x  
 = − 3/8 · [1 + 4 cot^{−2}x] · cot^{8/3}x  
 = − 3/8 cot^{8/3}x − 3/2 cot^{2/3}x + C.

The two candidates give the same tangential component (0), but their normal components differ:  

• Candidate 1: ω² |a|  
• Candidate 2: a ω²

Both candidates give the function

  S(x) = ¼ ln((1+x)/(1−x)) + ½ arctan x,

except that Candidate 1 writes the logarithm with absolute values, ln(|x+1|/|x−1|).  
For the interval of convergence of the series (|x| < 1), we always have 1+x > 0 and 1−x > 0, so the absolute values do not change the expression. Therefore, on the domain relevant to the sum of the series, the two formulas are identical.

Hence the two candidates’ answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers give the same mathematical expression up to an absolute-value notation on the logarithm.  

For the series in question the natural domain is |x| < 1 (radius of convergence 1).  
On this interval 1+x > 0 and 1-x > 0, so

ln| (1+x)/(1-x) | = ln( (1+x)/(1-x) ).

Thus the two candidates coincide across the entire domain where the series sum is defined. Hence they are equivalent.

• Candidate 2 explicitly writes two new integral expressions after performing circular permutations.

Denominator: (3 x⁷ + 2 x⁶)⁵ = [x⁶(3 x + 2)]⁵ = x³⁰(3 x + 2)⁵

The two candidates disagree on several requested items:

• Decreasing intervals (item 6): Candidate 1 omits the single point 0, while Candidate 2 includes it.
• Concavity intervals (items 7 and 8): the two candidates give different sub-intervals on (−√6/2, √6/2); each assigns concave-up vs concave-down oppositely on (−√6/2, 0) and (0, √6/2).

Because the answers are not identical for every sub-problem, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give the same answers for items 1-4, 7-9, and their increasing-interval answers for item 5 match as sets.  
However, for item 6 (intervals where the function is decreasing) they differ:

• Candidate 1:  (−3/√2, −√3/√2) ∪ (−√3/√2, 0) ∪ (0, √3/√2) ∪ (√3/√2, 3/√2)  
• Candidate 2:  (−3√2/2, −√6/2) ∪ (−√6/2, √6/2) ∪ (√6/2, 3√2/2)

The two descriptions use equivalent numerical endpoints, but Candidate 2’s middle interval includes the point 0 whereas Candidate 1 splits the interval at 0 and excludes that point. Consequently the two sets are not identical; their answers for item 6 differ.

Because at least one required sub-answer is different, the overall submissions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
−(cos x)/(5 sin⁵ x) − (4/15)(cos x)/(sin³ x) − (8/15)(cos x)/(sin x)+C  
= −(1/5) cot⁵ x − (4/15) cot³ x − (8/15) cot x + C.

Candidate 2 is  
− cot x − (2/3) cot³ x − (1/5) cot⁵ x + C.

Comparing the coefficients of cot x and cot³ x, we see they are different (−8/15 vs −1, and −4/15 vs −2/3, respectively).  
The difference between the two expressions is not a constant, so they are not equivalent antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers are antiderivatives and can differ only by an additive constant.

Rewrite Candidate 2 in the same “basis” used by Candidate 1:

cot(x)      =  cos/sin  
cot³(x)     =  cos³/sin³ = cos(1-sin²)/sin³ = cos/sin³ – cos/sin  
cot⁵(x)     =  cos⁵/sin⁵ = cos(1-2sin²+sin⁴)/sin⁵ = cos/sin⁵ – 2cos/sin³ + cos/sin  

So

Candidate 2 =  –cot – (2/3)cot³ – (1/5)cot⁵  
             = –cos/sin – (2/3)[cos/sin³ – cos/sin] – (1/5)[cos/sin⁵ – 2cos/sin³ + cos/sin]  
             = –(1/5)cos/sin⁵ – (4/15)cos/sin³ – (8/15)cos/sin + C.

Candidate 1, after distributing the factor 4/5, is exactly

            –(1/5)cos/sin⁵ – (4/15)cos/sin³ – (8/15)cos/sin + C.

The two expressions match term-by-term; therefore they differ at most by a constant and represent the same antiderivative.

243π/8 is three times larger than 81π/8 (since 243 = 3·81). Therefore the two candidates give different numerical results.
Both answers give the same coefficient:

Candidate 1: 4 / (3√3)  
Multiply numerator and denominator by √3: 4√3 / (3·3) = 4√3 / 9.

Candidate 2: 4√3 / 9.

Thus, the two expressions are algebraically identical (and numerically match to at least six significant digits), so the candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates describe the same set of rational numbers.  
Rewrite Candidate 1:

x = (q² − 3)/(1 − 2q)  
    = −(q² − 3)/(2q − 1).

Candidate 2 already has

x = −(t² − 3)/(2t − 1).

Thus, after the trivial sign manipulation, the two parameterisations have identical form with just a different dummy parameter name (q versus t). Both require the denominator to be non-zero (parameter ≠ ½). Hence the two answers generate exactly the same set of rational x-values.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 2 writes  

 x = (3 − t²)/(2t − 1).

If we multiply both numerator and denominator by −1 we get  

 x = (t² − 3)/(1 − 2t).

Renaming t to q (any rational letter) gives  

 x = (q² − 3)/(1 − 2q),

which is exactly Candidate 1’s expression.  
Both candidates implicitly exclude the value that makes the denominator zero (q = t = 1/2), so the admissible sets coincide.

Therefore the two predictions describe the same set of rational x-values.

Candidate 1 gives the area as (5/4) π = 1.250000 π.  
Candidate 2 gives the area as 5 π/8 = 0.625000 π.

Comparing the numerical values to 6 significant digits, 1.250000 π ≠ 0.625000 π. Therefore, the two answers are not the same.

Both candidates present exactly the same exponential function, written with identical numerical coefficient and base:

Both candidates supply two required numerical answers: the minimum and the maximum of the function under the given constraints.  
Candidate 1 states: minimum = 1/2, maximum = 3/2.  
Candidate 2 states: maximum = 3/2, minimum = 1/2.  

Although the order of presentation is reversed, each candidate clearly labels which value is the minimum and which is the maximum, and the numeric values (1/2 and 3/2) are identical. Hence every required sub-answer matches exactly (Rule 2 and Rule 3). No unit issues arise (Rule 1), and the numbers match exactly to six significant digits (Rule 4).  

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.
Both candidates give the same two numerical values, 3/2 and 1/2, as the extremal values.  
Candidate 1 explicitly states which is the minimum (1/2) and which is the maximum (3/2).  
Candidate 2 lists the same two numbers (3/2 and 1/2) without explicit labels, but the question does not insist on an ordering, only that both extreme values be provided. Since the set {3/2, 1/2} is identical in both answers, the responses are equivalent.

Both candidates give five answers, matching the five sub-questions.

Comparison sub-answer by sub-answer:

1. 4  (Candidate 1) vs 4 lb (Candidate 2)  
   – Pounds are explicitly requested; “4” can only mean 4 lb here → equivalent.

2. 4  vs 4 quarts  
   – Quarts requested; “4” clearly means 4 quarts → equivalent.

3. 4  vs 4 pints  
   – Pints requested; “4” clearly means 4 pints → equivalent.

4. 6000  vs 6000 kg (also stated as 6 metric tons)  
   – The numeric value 6000 corresponds to 6000 kg; Candidate 2 explicitly gives the same quantity. → equivalent.

5. 10.25  vs 10 lb 4 oz  
   – 10 lb 4 oz = 10 + 4⁄16 lb = 10.25 lb, matching Candidate 1’s 10.25. → equivalent.

No sub-answer disagrees; unit omissions in Candidate 1 do not change any numeric value and do not introduce ambiguity that would alter correctness relative to Candidate 2’s statements.

Therefore the two sets of predictions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
For each of the five required answers we must compare both the numerical value and the unit (Rule 1).  
Questions 1–3: both candidates give the same numerical values and the required units are either stated (Candidate 2) or unambiguously implied by the question (Candidate 1), so these three match.

Question 4:  
• Candidate 1 gives “6,000” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “6 metric tons”.  
Because the question could reasonably be answered in kilograms or in metric tons, omitting the unit creates ambiguity. Moreover, if Candidate 1’s 6,000 is kilograms, it equals 6 metric tons numerically, but if it is metric tons it would be 1,000 times larger. Rule 1 states that when such ambiguity exists the answers are considered inequivalent.

Since at least one sub-answer differs (or is ambiguous versus explicit), the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.
Step-by-step comparison of the five required sub-answers:

1. Question asks for pounds (lbs).  
   • Cand-1: “4” (unit omitted).  
   • Cand-2: “4 lbs”.  
   Only one sensible unit (lbs) is expected, so omission is not ambiguous → treat as equivalent.

2. Question asks for quarts.  
   • Cand-1: “4”.  
   • Cand-2: “4 quarts”.  
   Only one sensible unit (quarts) expected → equivalent.

3. Question asks for pints.  
   • Cand-1: “4”.  
   • Cand-2: “4 pints”.  
   Only one sensible unit (pints) expected → equivalent.

4. Question could reasonably be answered either in kilograms or in metric tons.  
   • Cand-1: “6000” (no unit).  
   • Cand-2: “6 metric tons”.  
   Because more than one unit is reasonable here, omitting the unit in Cand-1 creates ambiguity (6000 kg ≠ 6000 metric tons).  Rule 1 says such ambiguity makes the answers inequivalent.

5. Question asks for a weight; two units (lbs, oz) are plausible.  
   • Cand-1: “10.25” (ambiguous).  
   • Cand-2: “10 lb 4 oz”.  
   Again, omission is ambiguous (could be 10.25 lbs, 10.25 oz, etc.).

Since at least one sub-answer (#4, and also #5) is not equivalent between the two candidates, the overall sets of answers are not identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has 5 separate sub-problems, each expecting a numerical value together with an implicit or explicit unit.

Comparison of the two candidate answer lists:

1. Sub-problem 1  
   • Cand 1: “4” (unit omitted)  
   • Cand 2: “4 lbs”  
   Here only one reasonable unit (pounds) exists, so omission is harmless – values match.

2. Sub-problem 2  
   • Cand 1: “4” (unit omitted)  
   • Cand 2: “4 quarts”  
   Only one reasonable unit (quarts) – values match.

3. Sub-problem 3  
   • Cand 1: “4” (unit omitted)  
   • Cand 2: “4 pints”  
   Only one reasonable unit (pints) – values match.

4. Sub-problem 4  
   • Cand 1: “6,000” (no unit)  
   • Cand 2: “6 metric tons”  
   Two different units (kilograms vs. metric tons) are both reasonable for this result (6 metric tons = 6 000 kg). Because Cand 1 supplies no unit, there is genuine ambiguity: “6 000” could mean 6 000 kg (matching Cand 2) or 6 000 metric tons (very different). Rule 1 says that when omission introduces such ambiguity, the answers are considered inequivalent.

5. Sub-problem 5  
   • Cand 1: “10.25” (unit omitted)  
   • Cand 2: “10 lb and 4 oz”  
   The result can reasonably be expressed either in pounds (decimal form) or in pounds-and-ounces. Again, because Cand 1 gives no unit, ambiguity exists (10.25 could be 10.25 lb, 10.25 oz, etc.), so the two responses are not guaranteed to be the same.

Since at least one sub-answer is ambiguous and thus not verifiably identical, the two sets of answers are not equivalent according to Rules 1 and 2.

Because at least one sub-answer is not the same, the overall predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives an exact expression  
x = ln(0.15)/(-0.28).

Evaluating: ln(0.15) ≈ –1.89711998, so  
x ≈ 6.7754285 months.

Candidate 2 states 6.7754 months.

To decide equivalence we must compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

• Candidate 1: 6.77542… → first 6 significant digits = 6 7 7 5 4 2  
• Candidate 2: 6.7754 (only 5 significant digits; if padded to 6 it is 6.77540) → first 6 significant digits = 6 7 7 5 4 0

They differ in the 6th significant digit (2 vs 0). Therefore, according to Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives must coincide (up to an additive constant) for every x in the domain of the original real-valued integrand.

Write  
A = x+4+√(x²+2x+5).

Candidate 2 gives  
F₂(x) =  (1/√13) ln| (A-√13)/(A+√13) | + C.

Candidate 1 gives  
F₁(x) = (1/√13) ln[ (√13-A)/(A+√13) ] + C  
        = (1/√13) ln[ −(A-√13)/(A+√13) ] + C.

Hence  
F₁(x) = (1/√13) [ ln|(A-√13)/(A+√13)| + ln(−1) ] + C  
       = F₂(x) + (1/√13) ln(−1).

The extra term (1/√13) ln(−1) is not a real constant; moreover, the logarithm in Candidate 1 changes by iπ whenever (A-√13) changes sign, so F₁ and F₂ differ by more than a global constant on the real domain. Consequently the two expressions are not equivalent real antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Both candidates give the antiderivative  

Candidate 1:  −3 sin³(x/3)/cos(x/3) + (3/2)x − (9/4) sin(2x/3) + C  

Candidate 2:  (3/2)x − 3 tan(x/3) − (3/4) sin(2x/3) + C  

Let θ = x/3.  Compare the parts that differ:

−3 sin³θ /cosθ − (9/4) sin(2θ)  versus  −3 tan θ − (3/4) sin(2θ).

Difference D:

D = [−3 sin³θ /cosθ − (9/4) sin(2θ)] − [−3 tanθ − (3/4) sin(2θ)]
  = −3 sin³θ /cosθ + 3 tanθ − (9/4−3/4) sin(2θ)
  = −3 sin³θ /cosθ + 3 sinθ /cosθ − (6/4) sin(2θ)
  = 3 sinθ cosθ − 3 sinθ cosθ = 0.

Thus the two expressions differ only by 0 (i.e., at most by a constant), so they represent the same indefinite integral.

Both answers represent the antiderivative in the form  

I = 3x ln(√(2−x)+√(2+x)) + 3 arcsin(x/2) − (3/2)x + (constant).

Candidate 1 expands this expression with an inner constant “C” inside a parenthesis, which after distributing the factor −3/2 merely changes the overall additive constant. Candidate 2 writes the same functional part and appends an arbitrary “+ C”. Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary additive constant, the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ in the coefficient of arcsin(x/2):

• Candidate 1 simplifies (absorbing the “C” into the integration constant) to  
  3x ln( … )  − (3/2)x  + 3 arcsin(x/2) + constant.

• Candidate 2 is  
  3x ln( … )  − (3/2)x  + 9 arcsin(x/2) + constant.

Because 3 arcsin(x/2) ≠ 9 arcsin(x/2) (they differ by a non-constant factor of 3), the two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives can differ at most by an additive constant.  
Let  

A(x) = √[(x+2)/(x-2)]·(x-10) − 6 ln | (√(x-2) − √(x+2)) / (√(x-2)+√(x+2)) | ,  
B(x) = √(x²−4) − 8 √[(x+2)/(x-2)] + 6 ln ( x + √(x²−4) ).

Compute the difference D(x)=A(x)−B(x):

1. Combine the algebraic terms:
   √[(x+2)/(x-2)]·(x-10)+8√[(x+2)/(x-2)]
   = √[(x+2)/(x-2)]·(x-2)
   = √(x²−4).

   Hence these cancel the −√(x²−4) in B(x).

2. The remaining logarithmic terms give
   D(x)=−6[ ln( (√(x-2)−√(x+2))/(√(x-2)+√(x+2)) ) + ln( x+√(x²−4) ) ]  
       = −6 ln\{ (√(x-2)−√(x+2))/(√(x-2)+√(x+2)) · (x+√(x²−4}) \}.

   Setting a=√(x-2), b=√(x+2), one checks
   (a−b)/(a+b) · (x+√(x²−4)) = −2,
   so with absolute values the logarithm becomes ln 2, a constant.

Thus D(x)=−6 ln 2, i.e. A(x)=B(x)−6 ln 2.  
Since they differ only by a constant, the two candidates are equivalent antiderivatives.

Both expressions can be rewritten in a common form.

Algebraic part  
Candidate 1: (x − 10) √(x+2)/√(x−2)  
     = ((x−10)(x+2)) / (√(x−2) √(x+2))  
     = (x² − 8x − 20) / √(x² − 4)  
which equals Candidate 2’s algebraic term.

Logarithmic part  
Candidate 1: −6 ln| (√(x−2) − √(x+2)) / (√(x−2) + √(x+2)) |  
   = 6 ln|√(x−2)+√(x+2)| − 6 ln|√(x−2)−√(x+2)|.

Candidate 2: 6 ln( x + √(x²−4) )  
Using (√(x−2)+√(x+2))² = 2(x + √(x²−4)), one finds  
6 ln( x + √(x²−4) ) = 12 ln|√(x−2)+√(x+2)| − 6 ln 2.

Taking the difference of the two log parts gives 6 ln 2, a constant.  
Hence the two antiderivatives differ only by an overall additive constant, which is allowable for indefinite integrals.

Therefore Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are equivalent.

The two expressions represent antiderivatives that differ only by an overall constant:

Candidate 1 simplifies to
(½ x² − 25/2) ln(x+5) − ¼ x² + (5/2)x + constant.

Candidate 2 is
(½ x² − 25/2) ln(x+5) − ¼ x² + (5/2)x + constant.

Since an indefinite integral is defined up to an arbitrary constant, the two candidates are mathematically the same antiderivative. Therefore, they are equivalent.

Candidate 2 presents the complete Taylor series about x = –1:
 e^x = Σ_{n=0}^{∞} e^{-1}(x+1)^n / n!.

Candidate 1 writes only the terms up to n = 3 and then adds a fourth-order remainder term
 e^x = e^{-1}[1 + (x+1) + (x+1)^2/2! + (x+1)^3/3!] + (x+1)^4 e^{ξ}/4!,
where ξ depends on x and lies between x and –1.

Because Candidate 1 truncates the series and uses an indeterminate remainder e^{ξ}, the two expressions are not the same representation: Candidate 2 gives an explicit infinite series with known coefficients, while Candidate 1 gives only a finite sum plus an unspecified remainder.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the completed-square form

2 (x − 1.5)² − 13.5  (Candidate 1)  
2 (x − 3/2)² − 27/2  (Candidate 2)

Since 1.5 = 3/2 and −13.5 = −27/2, the two expressions are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give the first six non-zero Maclaurin coefficients, just written differently.

Candidate 1 coefficients after factoring 1/(34560√2):
 constant: 34560 → 1/√2 = √2/2  
 x¹: 34560 → √2/2  
 x²: −17280 → −√2/4  
 x³: −5760 → −√2/12  
 x⁴: 1440 → √2/48  
 x⁵: 288 → √2/240  

These exactly match Candidate 2:
 √2/2 + √2/2 x − √2/4 x² − √2/12 x³ + √2/48 x⁴ + √2/240 x⁵.

Hence the two answers are mathematically the same.

The question specifically asks for each dimension (width, length, and height).  

• Candidate 2 explicitly identifies all three quantities: width = 4 in, length = 8 in, height = 6 in.  
• Candidate 1 merely lists the numbers “4, 6, 8” without stating which number corresponds to which required dimension.  
Because Candidate 1 omits the explicit assignment of each required element (width, length, height), the response is ambiguous and incomplete relative to the question’s demand, while Candidate 2 is fully specified.

Hence the two answers are not considered equivalent.
Both answers give the same three numerical dimensions {4, 6, 8}.  
Candidate 2 explicitly labels them (width = 4 in, length = 8 in, height = 6 in).  
Candidate 1 lists the same three lengths without labels; order is not required by the prompt “Find the dimensions of the box,” so any permutation of the same three numbers suffices.  
Units are consistent (inches, implicitly or explicitly).

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates answer all three required sub-questions, and for each sub-question they give exactly the same information:

1. Concave up: the entire real line split into the open intervals (−∞, −1), (−1, 0), (0, ∞).  
   • Candidate 1 lists them separately.  
   • Candidate 2 lists their union with ∪.  
   These describe the same set.

2. Concave down: “None” in both answers.

3. Points of inflection: “None” in both answers.

Thus every sub-answer matches, satisfying Rule 2, and there is no unit or notation conflict. The two sets of predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives

• height ≈ 1.80247 m

Candidate 2 gives  
• radius ≈ 2.14000 m  
• height ≈ 1.80000 m

Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):  
radius: 2.13580 ≠ 2.14000  
height: 1.80247 ≠ 1.80000

Since neither value matches to 6 significant digits, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both answers give the antiderivative

up to the arbitrary constant of integration.  
The order of terms inside the numerator (1 + 2 tan x versus 2 tan x + 1) is immaterial, and the placement of the constant C is likewise irrelevant.

Candidate 1 asserts that there is a minimum at (0, 0) and says the second-derivative test gives a conclusive classification there.  
Candidate 2 says the second-derivative test is inconclusive for every critical point (including (0, 0)) and therefore gives no minimum, maximum, or saddle classification.

These statements conflict (one gives a minimum, the other does not), so the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives
  (3/8) sin(4x) + (9/128) sin(8x) + (15/16)x – (1/32) sin³(4x) + C.

Candidate 2 gives
  3·( (15/16)x + (3/8) sin(4x) + (9/128) sin(8x) – (1/32) sin³(4x) ) + C
= (45/16)x + (9/8) sin(4x) + (27/128) sin(8x) – (3/32) sin³(4x) + C.

Thus every non-constant term in Candidate 2 is exactly three times the corresponding term in Candidate 1. Two indefinite integrals may differ only by an additive constant, not by an overall multiplicative factor. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give two answers as required (minimum and maximum).

Minimum:

• Candidate 2: −16/35  
Identical.

Maximum:
• Candidate 1: “None” (i.e., does not exist / unbounded)  
• Candidate 2: “there is no maximum value”  
Same meaning.

Thus every sub-answer matches exactly; the responses are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same mathematical expression:

Candidate 1:  −(84 x² + 1372)/(x² − 49)³  
Candidate 2:  2/(x + 7)³ − 2/(x − 7)³  
      = [2((x − 7)³ − (x + 7)³)]/[(x + 7)³(x − 7)³]  
      = [2(−42 x² − 686)]/(x² − 49)³  
      = −(84 x² + 1372)/(x² − 49)³

Since the simplified forms match exactly, the two answers are equivalent.
Both candidates state

–(84 x² + 1372)/(x² – 49)³.

Candidate 2’s form:
–28(3x² + 49) = –(84x² + 1372),

which is exactly the same numerator as Candidate 1, with the same denominator. Hence the two expressions are mathematically identical.

Both candidates express the antiderivative (up to an arbitrary additive constant) in terms of the same five component functions of x:

1. (2x)^{2/3} with coefficient −3/4  
2. (2x)^{1/2} with coefficient −1  
3. (2x)^{1/3} with coefficient −3/2  
4. (2x)^{1/6} with coefficient −3  
5. ln| (2x)^{1/6} − 1 | with coefficient −3  

Candidate 1 initially writes

C − 3 [½(2x)^{1/3} + ⅓(2x)^{1/2} + ¼(2x)^{2/3} + (2x)^{1/6} + ln|…|],

which distributes to

C − (3/2)(2x)^{1/3} − (2x)^{1/2} − (3/4)(2x)^{2/3} − 3(2x)^{1/6} − 3 ln|…|.

This is exactly the expression written by Candidate 2 (ordering aside), differing only by a re-labeled constant of integration, which is immaterial.

Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

Both candidates represent the same mathematical quantity.

Candidate 1:  
(2 e^{2t}) / (2 + 2 e^{4t} + 4 e^{2t})  
= e^{2t} / (1 + e^{4t} + 2 e^{2t})  
= e^{2t} / (e^{2t} + 1)^2.

Candidate 2:  
1 / (e^{t} + e^{-t})^2  
= 1 / [e^{-2t}(e^{2t} + 1)^2]  
= e^{2t} / (e^{2t} + 1)^2.

Since both simplify to the identical expression, the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for two specific items.  
Candidate 1 supplies only nine non-zero terms instead of ten, and its remainder bound is different from Candidate 2’s.  
Candidate 2 supplies ten terms and a different remainder bound.

Since at least one required sub-answer differs (both in the series and in the remainder estimate), the two candidates’ answers are not identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each give answers for two sub-questions:

1.  Extrema of the function  
    •  Candidate 1 supplies three points (x, y).  
    •  Candidate 2 gives only the x–coordinates (and their nature).  
    Because the problem normally requires the full extrema points, Candidate 2 is missing the y–values, so the two answers are not identical for this sub-question.

2.  Largest and smallest values on [–2, 4]  
    •  Both give the largest value 46⁄3.  
    •  For the smallest value Candidate 1 gives –1.8023 (≈ –1.802300), while Candidate 2 gives (1 – 16√2)/12 ≈ –1.802285.  
      Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4): –1.802300 vs –1.802285 differ in the 6th digit, so they are not the same.

Since at least one required sub-answer differs and another is incomplete, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the function values at the two local minima as 1.969 … and –1.8023 …, while Candidate 2 gives the exact values (1 + 16√2)/12 ≈ 1.968951… and (1 – 16√2)/12 ≈ –1.802284….

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• 1.96900 vs 1.96895 ⇒ mismatch at the 4th significant digit.  
• –1.80230 vs –1.80228 ⇒ mismatch at the 5th significant digit.

Because at least one required numerical result differs to six significant digits, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates express the same quantity:

1. Candidate 1:  (1 – a)/(a x² + b x + c)²
2. Candidate 2:  (1 – a) y⁴, and since y = 1/√(a x² + b x + c), we have y⁴ = 1/(a x² + b x + c)².

Thus (1 – a) y⁴ = (1 – a)/(a x² + b x + c)², identical to Candidate 1.

Both candidates ultimately give the same numerical value for the probability:

• Candidate 1 lists it twice, once as “1/4” and once as “25 %”.  
• Candidate 2 gives “1/4”.

Since 1/4 = 0.25 = 25 %, the two responses represent the same quantity (probability 0.25). Although Candidate 1 repeats the answer in two equivalent forms, there is no contradiction; both candidates convey the identical single value required by the question.

Both answers give a two-component spinor normalized to 1.  

Candidate 1: (1/√2) (i, 1)  
Candidate 2: (1/√2) (1, −i)

Multiplying Candidate 2 by the global phase factor i gives i·(1/√2)(1, −i)= (1/√2)(i, 1), which is exactly Candidate 1.  
Because an overall non-zero complex phase does not change the physical spinor and the question only asks for “a” normalized eigenfunction (any representative is acceptable), the two candidates represent the same eigenfunction.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both spinors differ only by an overall phase factor ( −i ), i.e. 
(1/√2) (1, −i)ᵀ = (−i)·(1/√2) (i, 1)ᵀ.  
Since an overall phase does not change the physical state and the problem asks only for one normalized eigenfunction, the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question has four sub-parts.  
For sub-problem 2 (momentum–probability density) the candidates give:

• Candidate 1:  
  8 a π / ħ · cos²(pa/2ħ) /[(pa/ħ)² a² – π²]²  dp  
  → simplifies to 8 a π ħ³ cos²(pa/2ħ)/(a²p² – π²ħ²)²  dp.

• Candidate 2:  
  8 π a cos²(pa/2ħ)/(π²ħ² – a²p²)²  dp  
  = 8 a π cos²(pa/2ħ)/(a²p² – π²ħ²)²  dp.

Thus Candidate 1’s density differs by an extra factor of ħ³ from Candidate 2’s, and Candidate 1 also adds a special piece for p = 0 that Candidate 2 lacks. Therefore the answers are not the same. All other sub-answers match, but Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to agree for overall equivalence.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

The problem effectively asks for four distinct pieces of information:
1. Ground-state energy.  
2. Momentum-probability density f(p) dp after the walls vanish.  
3. Energy associated with a particle that has momentum p.  
4. Discussion of energy conservation (average energy).

Comparison of the candidates:

1. Ground-state energy: both give \(E=\pi^{2}\hbar^{2}/(2ma^{2})\). (match)

2. f(p) dp:
   • Candidate 1: \( \dfrac{8\pi a}{\hbar}\,\dfrac{\cos^{2}(ka/2)}{[(ka)^{2}-\pi^{2}]^{2}}\,dp\)  
   • Candidate 2: \( \dfrac{4\pi a}{\hbar}\,\dfrac{\cos^{2}(pa/2\hbar)}{(\pi^{2}-(pa/\hbar)^{2})^{2}}\,dp\)

   Aside from the sign (irrelevant because squared), Candidate 1 has an overall factor of 8 while Candidate 2 has 4 — a factor-of-2 discrepancy. Candidate 1 also treats p = 0 separately, Candidate 2 does not. They are not identical.

3. Energy for momentum p:
   • Candidate 1 gives only an average energy \(\bar{E}= \pi^{2}\hbar^{2}/(2ma^{2})\).  
   • Candidate 2 gives the required individual energy \(E=p^{2}/2m\).  
   The answers differ, and Candidate 1 is missing the explicit required expression.

4. Energy-conservation explanation: Candidate 2 provides one; Candidate 1 does not explicitly (only states the average energy again).

Because sub-answers 2 and 3 disagree and Candidate 1 omits part 4, the two candidates are not equivalent under Rule 2 (and the detailed discrepancies).

• Candidate 1:  +e²F²/(2k)  
• Candidate 2:  –e²F²/(2k)

Both predictions can be related through the dispersion relation for a non-relativistic particle:  

E = ħ²k²/(2m)  ⇒  1/k² = ħ²/(2mE).

Candidate 2: σ = 4π/k²  
     = 4π · (ħ² / 2mE)  
     = 2πħ² / (mE),

which is exactly Candidate 1. Hence they provide the same result.

The original problem asks for two separate results:  
(a) the probability of being in the new ground state, and  
(b) the times T that guarantee return to the original ground state.

Candidate 1 supplies two answers—one for (a) and one for (b).  
Candidate 2 supplies only one answer, addressing (b) and giving no probability for (a).

By Rule 2, when a question requires multiple answers, both candidates must give all of them to be considered equivalent. Because Candidate 2 omits the answer to part (a), the two candidates’ responses are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ by an overall numerical factor of 9 ( 1024 / 81 vs. 1024 / 729 ) while the rest of the structure (the dependence on α, ħ, m, b, …) is identical. Because the coefficients are not the same, the probabilities predicted by the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same mathematical expression once the algebra is simplified:

1. Candidate 1:  
   P = (32 beE₀ / (9 ħ π²))² · ħ² / [α²ħ² + (3π²ħ² / (8mb²))²]

   • (32 beE₀ / (9 ħ π²))² = 1024 b²e²E₀² / (81 ħ²π⁴)  
   • Multiply by ħ² → 1024 b²e²E₀² / (81 π⁴)  
   • Denominator α²ħ² + (3π²ħ² / (8mb²))² = ħ²[α² + (3π²ħ / (8mb²))²]

   Therefore  
   P₁ = 1024 b²e²E₀² / (81 π⁴ħ²) · 1 / [α² + (3π²ħ / (8mb²))²].

2. Candidate 2 is already written as  
   P₂ = 1024 b²e²E₀² / (81 π⁴ħ²) · 1 / [α² + (3π²ħ / (8mb²))²].

Since P₁ = P₂ exactly (same factors and same denominator), the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives two explicit answers, one for (a) and one for (b):
(a)  ω = 2 μ B_z / ħ  
(b)  P = (μ B₀ / ħΩ)² sin²(Ω t) with Ω ≃ ω/2 + μ B_z/ħ  

Candidate 2 provides only a single formula for P(t):
 P = μ² B₀² / [ħ²(ω – 2 μ B_z/ħ)²] · sin²[(ω – 2 μ B_z/ħ)t/2]

1. For sub-problem (a) Candidate 1 states the resonance condition explicitly; Candidate 2 never gives an explicit value of ω—it is only implicit in the denominator of the probability formula.  
2. For sub-problem (b) the two probability formulas are different (different denominators and different sine arguments).  

Because at least one required sub-answer differs and one candidate omits an explicit answer for part (a), the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives

σₜ = π ( a − tan(k₀ a)/k₀ )²

The two expressions differ by an overall factor of 4, so they are not the same result.

The two proposed formulas for the total cross section are not the same:

• Candidate 1 contains 4 π a² multiplied by a squared bracket with an ordinary tangent, tan( k₀a ).  
• Candidate 2 contains only π (not 4 π) and a squared bracket with a hyperbolic tangent, tanh( a√(3mₙV₀)/ħ ).  

Even if one tried to relate k₀ to √(mₙV₀)/ħ, the ordinary tangent and the hyperbolic tangent are not interchangeable unless V₀ changes sign (real → imaginary arguments) and the overall numeric prefactors (4 vs 1) still disagree. Therefore the two expressions are inequivalent.

2. Energy in the spherical basis.

Comparison:

Rectilinear basis

• Candidate 2:  E = (2k + ℓ + 3/2) ħω

The problem asks for four separate answers (a)–(d).  
We must compare the two candidates’ replies for every part.

a) Candidate 1: |q γ₁₂ α|/ħ ; Candidate 2: e γ₁₂ α/ħ  
(If q = ±e the magnitudes coincide, so (a) could match.)

b) Candidate 1: (q r₁₂ α/ħ)² ; Candidate 2: e² γ₁₂² α²/ħ²  
With q = ±e and r₁₂ = γ₁₂, these are the same, so (b) matches.

c) Candidate 1: −2 α q r₁₂²/ħ · sin[ω₀(t−t₁)]  
Candidate 2:  2 e² γ₁₂² α/ħ · sin(ω₀ t)  
Even taking q = ±e and r₁₂ = γ₁₂, Candidate 1 carries only one power of e whereas Candidate 2 carries e²; they also differ by an overall sign (depending on q) and by a phase shift (t−t₁ vs t). Hence (c) is not the same.

Because at least one of the four required answers disagrees, Rule 2 says the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same answers for ⟨r⟩, ⟨r²⟩, the most-probable radius, and ⟨T⟩, but they differ in the other required parts:

• Part (b):  
  – Candidate 1 supplies a fixed numerical probability 1.76 × 10⁻¹⁴.  
  – Candidate 2 gives only the formula (4/3)(R/a₀)³.  
  These are not exactly identical; agreement would require choosing a specific R, so they are considered different under Rule 2.

• Part (c):  
  The two momentum-space wave-functions have different overall normalization factors:  
  (2 a₀)^{3/2}/π  versus  2√2 a₀^{3/2}/√π, which differ by √π.  
  Hence the answers are not the same.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give identical values for  
⟨r⟩, ⟨r²⟩, the most–probable radius, the momentum-space wave-function (apart from the trivial change of variable k = p/ħ), and ⟨T⟩.

However, for part (b) they do not give the same answer:

• Candidate 1: P = 1.76 × 10⁻¹⁴ (a fixed number).  
• Candidate 2: P = (4/3)(R/a₀)³ (an expression that depends on the nuclear radius R).

Unless a specific numerical value of R is supplied, these two statements are not the same quantity; Candidate 2’s result can only coincide with Candidate 1’s number for one particular choice of R, which is not specified.  

Because at least one of the required sub-answers differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent under Rule 2.

   After accounting for k = p/ħ, the overall normalization constants differ by a factor ≈ 16, so the wave-functions are not equivalent.

Because at least one answer in parts (b) and (c) is not the same, the two candidate solutions are not equivalent according to Rule 2 and Rule 8.
The question has three sub-parts, each demanding explicit numerical/functional results.

Comparison of answers:

(a) All three values (⟨r⟩, ⟨r²⟩, most-probable r) are identical for both candidates.

(b) Probability inside nucleus  
• Candidate 1: 1.76 × 10⁻¹⁴  
• Candidate 2: ≈ 10⁻¹⁴  
These differ in the first significant digit (1.76… vs 1.00…). Rule 4 requires agreement to 6 significant figures; they do not match.

(c) Momentum-space wave function and ⟨T⟩  
• Candidate 1 gives a fully normalized ψ(k).  
• Candidate 2 only gives a proportional form φ(p) ∝ …, omitting the normalization constant, and uses p rather than k. Hence the two wave-functions are not identical.  
Both give the same expression for ⟨T⟩, but the wave-function answers are not equivalent.

Because sub-answers (b) and (c) differ, the overall responses are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each give two required outputs:  
(a) a variational/Rayleigh–quotient statement, and  
(b) a numerical upper-bound coefficient multiplying T₀/(μ₀a²).

(a) Both give essentially the same generic Rayleigh quotient, so part (a) matches.

(b) The coefficients differ:  
• Candidate 1: 19.739 (to six digits 19.7390)  
• Candidate 2: 20 (to six digits 20.0000)

Since 19.7390 ≠ 20.0000 (Rule 4) and the problem requires both parts to match (Rule 2), the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same functional form for the wave-function and the same expectation value ⟨1/|r₁–r₂|⟩ and e-e interaction energy.  
However, their numeric values for

• the uncorrected ground-state energy (–109 eV vs –108.8 eV)  
• the corrected ground-state energy (–75 eV vs –74.8 eV)

differ, and they are not equal to 6 significant digits as required.  
Since at least one required sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.
The question asks for several specific numerical and functional answers (wavefunction, unperturbed energy, ⟨1/|r₁–r₂|⟩, interaction energy, corrected total energy).  
To be equivalent, every single sub-answer must match.

Comparison:

1. Unperturbed ground-state energy  
   • Candidate 1: −109 eV  
   • Candidate 2: −108.8 eV  
   These differ by 0.2 eV and therefore do not coincide to 6 significant digits.

2. Corrected total energy  
   • Candidate 1: −75 eV  
   • Candidate 2: −74.8 eV  
   Again a 0.2 eV difference.

Because at least one required numerical answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 4).

Candidate 1 expresses the state as a superposition that involves only two electrons, each shown with a single orbital label (|1,1⟩) and a single spin label (|½,½⟩).  
Candidate 2, on the other hand, writes a superposition of two three-electron Slater-determinant-like configurations, explicitly listing three separate single-particle states, each with its own (mℓ, m_s) pair.

Because the number of electrons represented, the individual single-particle states used, and the overall structure of the expansions are different, the two proposed wave-functions cannot be the same state.

Candidate 2 gives only a single energy value (3.85 GeV).  

Because the original problem requires three distinct answers and Candidate 2 provides only one, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates give the same algebraic expression once simplified:

     = 2T²/(mc²) + 4T  
     = 4T + 2T²/(mc²)

Candidate 2: 4T + 2T²/(mc²)

The two expressions can be algebraically compared:

(2T² + 4T m c²)/(m c²)  
 = 2T²/(m c²) + 4T.

Candidate 2  
4T + 2T²/(m_p c²).

If we identify m with m_p (the proton mass, as implied in the question), the two results are

4T + 2T²/(m c²)  and  4T + 2T²/(m c²),

which are identical term-by-term. Hence the candidates give the same prediction.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both answer parts (a) and (b), but:

Part (a) Radius:  
• Candidate 1: 1.48 × 10⁵ cm = 1.48 km  
• Candidate 2: 2.97 km  
The two radii do not match to six significant digits (or even approximately).

Part (a) Density:  
• Candidate 1: 1.47 × 10¹⁷ g cm⁻³  
• Candidate 2: 1.82 × 10¹⁶ g cm⁻³  
These differ by almost an order of magnitude.

Because at least one sub-answer required by the question differs (Rule 2), the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 supplies answers for both parts (a) and (b); Candidate 2 gives values only for part (a) and omits part (b).  
Even comparing the part (a) numbers, they differ:

• Radius  
 C1: 1.48 × 10⁵ cm = 1.48 × 10³ m  
 C2: 2.97 × 10³ m  
 (not equal to 6 significant digits)

• Density  
 C1: 1.47 × 10¹⁷ g cm⁻³ = 1.47 × 10²⁰ kg m⁻³  
 C2: 1.83 × 10¹⁹ kg m⁻³  
 (not equal)

Additionally, Candidate 2 lacks any response to part (b).  
By Rule 2 (missing sub-answer) and the numerical discrepancies, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same exact set of normal-mode frequencies:

1. Longitudinal (along B): ω0  
2. Transverse:  
   ω+ = ½(ωc + √(ωc² + 4ω0²)),  
   ω− = ½(−ωc + √(ωc² + 4ω0²)),   where ωc = qB/m.

Candidate 1 lists these explicitly (answers 2 and 3) and then also writes their weak- and strong-field series expansions.  
Candidate 2 gives the same exact formulas and then gives their own (slightly less detailed) weak- and strong-field limits.

Since the core exact results are identical and the approximations do not contradict each other (candidate 1 merely keeps one higher-order term in ω+ for the strong-field limit), the two answers are equivalent.
Both candidates give

1. The three exact normal–mode frequencies  
   ω₀, ω₊ = ½(ω_c + √(ω_c² + 4ω₀²)), ω₋ = ½(−ω_c + √(ω_c² + 4ω₀²))  
   with ω_c = qB/m (candidate 1 writes eB/m, candidate 2 writes qB/m; same physical quantity).

2. Weak-field limit (ω_c ≪ ω₀):  
   ω₊ ≃ ω₀ + ω_c/2, ω₋ ≃ ω₀ − ω_c/2, ω₀ unchanged.

3. Strong-field limit (ω_c ≫ ω₀):  
   ω₊ ≃ ω_c, ω₀ unchanged, ω₋ ≃ ω₀²/ω_c.

Candidate 1 lists the exact formulas (answers 2,3) and then explicitly writes the weak-field (answers 4,5) and strong-field (answers 6,7) approximations.  
Candidate 2 gives the same exact formulas and the same weak- and strong-field approximations.  

Thus every required frequency and its limiting form matches between the two candidates; the extra repetition in candidate 1 does not contradict anything. According to the guidelines, the answers are equivalent.

The motion described implies that the spring force provides the centripetal force:

K r₀ = m ω² r₀  ⟹  K/m = ω².

Candidate 1:  ω′ = √(3 ω² + K/m)
               = √(3 ω² + ω²)   (using K/m = ω²)
               = √(4 ω²) = 2 ω.

Candidate 2:  ω′ = 2 ω.

After applying the necessary physical relation given by the problem, both candidates give the same frequency, 2 ω. Hence the two answers are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The uniform circular motion requires the spring to supply the centripetal force, giving the condition  

 K r₀ = m ω² r₀  ⇒ K/m = ω² .

Substituting this relation into Candidate 1:

 ω′ = √(3 ω² + K/m) = √(3 ω² + ω²) = √(4 ω²) = 2 ω .

Thus, under the physical constraint implied by the problem, Candidate 1 reduces exactly to Candidate 2. Therefore the two answers are equivalent. 

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different expressions for the frequency:

• Candidate 1: ω′ = √(3 ω² + K/m)  
• Candidate 2: ω′ = 2 ω

These expressions are not algebraically identical for general values of K, m, and ω. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: V(r) = − m h² / (2 r²)  
Candidate 2: V(r) = − L² / (2 m r²)

In orbital mechanics, h is the specific angular momentum (angular momentum per unit mass) and is related to the total angular momentum L by L = m h. Substituting h = L/m into Candidate 1 gives

V(r) = − m (L/m)² / (2 r²) = − L² / (2 m r²),

which is exactly Candidate 2. Thus the two expressions represent the same potential energy.

The question asks what the observer actually sees, and the identifiable markings are part of what must be described.  

• Candidate 1: only states that “The globe appears as a sphere,” giving no information about the markings (implicitly suggesting no change or leaving it unspecified).  
• Candidate 2: states that the globe looks like a sphere but specifies that the markings are rotated relative to their rest orientation.

Because candidate 2 adds a distinct piece of information (rotation of markings) that candidate 1 omits, the two answers are not identical. According to Rule 2 (multiple-part answer completeness) and Rule 6 (type/contents mismatch), the predictions are inequivalent.

The problem asks for two sets of results:  
(a) a Lorentz transformation for the position 4-vector and the corresponding momentum 4-vector, and  
(b) three specific Doppler-shift formulae.

Comparison:

1. Doppler formulas (part b)  
   • Both candidates list the same three expressions (approach, recede, perpendicular).  
   → Equivalent on this part.

2. Position 4-vector transformation (part a)  
   • Candidate 2 gives the usual primed–in-terms-of-unprimed form.  
   • Candidate 1 gives a matrix that, read literally, gives unprimed in terms of primed and also has a β sign opposite to Candidate 2’s (boost in the opposite direction). Thus the two expressions are not identical.

3. Momentum 4-vector transformation (part a)  
   • Candidate 2 writes the standard relations with E′, p′.  
   • Candidate 1 writes (p′x c, p′y c, p′z c, E) on the left, i.e. the energy component is unprimed, while the right side uses unprimed quantities—this mismatches the usual definition and is different from Candidate 2’s set.

Because at least one required component (in fact, two: the position and momentum transformations) is not given in identical form, Rule 2 says the overall answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give

3. All three requested Doppler-shift formulae, with exactly the same functional form in each of the three cases.

The question has three sub-parts, so we must check each sub-answer for equivalence.

(a) Mass of Earth  
• Candidate 1: uses g, R, G.  
• Candidate 2: uses g, R, G.  
→ Same.

(b) Mass of Moon  
• Candidate 1: uses a (Earth-Moon distance), T (orbital period), G and Mₑ.  
• Candidate 2: uses D (distance), T (orbital period) and Mₑ.  
→ Same type of quantities.

(c) Distance Earth–Sun  
• Candidate 1: gives a complicated formula involving Earth radius Rₑ and angular quantities α₁, α₂, λ₁, λ₂ (essentially a parallax method); it does not mention radar timing.  
• Candidate 2: explicitly cites radar signal time delays and planetary-transit parallax angles.  
→ They rely on different measurable quantities: Candidate 1 does not mention radar delay, Candidate 2 does; Candidate 2 does not mention Rₑ, α’s, λ’s of Candidate 1.  
Hence the two answers are not identical for part (c).

Numerically they coincide:

2. Velocity v/c: both give 12/13.

The only difference is that Candidate 2 omits the explicit unit on the first answer, but the question itself sets Mₚc² as the reference unit, so “12” unambiguously means 12 Mₚc². Hence the answers are equivalent.

The problem requests two sets of results:

A. Mirror moving in the x-direction:  θ_r and ν′.  
B. Mirror moving in the y-direction:  θ_r and ν′.

Candidate 1 supplies

• x-direction: ν′ = ν(1+2β cos θ_i+β²)/(1-β²),  cos θ_r = [(1+β²) cos θ_i+2β]/[1+2β cos θ_i+β²]  
• y-direction: ν′ = ν, θ_r = θ_i

Candidate 2 supplies

• x-direction: ν′ = ν, θ_r = θ_i  
• y-direction: ν′ = ν (c+v cos θ_i)²/(c²-v²) = ν(1+2β cos θ_i+β² cos² θ_i)/(1-β²),  
  cos θ_r = –[2β + (1+β²) cos θ_i]/(1+β cos θ_i)²

Hence:

1. For the x-direction case the two candidates give completely different results (Candidate 1: frequency and angle change; Candidate 2: no change).

2. For the y-direction case the formulas are also different (Candidate 1: no change; Candidate 2: change with explicit formulas).

Therefore none of the corresponding sub-answers match, so the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s second formula for tan φ′ is incomplete (no denominator given), so its set of answers is missing required information / ambiguous, whereas Candidate 2 supplies the complete expression (with denominator v cos φ − u as well as the velocity-component formulas).  
Since at least one corresponding sub-answer differs or is absent, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question requires two separate results:  
1. the transformed velocity, and  
2. the transformed direction (e.g., an expression for tan φ′).

Candidate 2 supplies formulas for both the velocity components (from which the speed follows) and an explicit complete expression for tan φ′.

Candidate 1 supplies a formula for the speed, but its second answer for tan φ′ is incomplete—the denominator is missing. Because one of the required sub-answers is incomplete/incorrect, the two sets of answers cannot be considered equivalent (Rule 2: all requested parts must be present and match).

Both candidates provide two answers, matching the two sub-questions.

1. Velocity of faster particle as seen from the slower one:
   • Candidate 1: 0.595 c  
   • Candidate 2: ≈0.595 c  
   → Same numerical value and same unit.

2. Velocity of slower particle as seen from the faster one:
   • Candidate 1: −0.595 c  
   • Candidate 2: ≈−0.595 c  
   → Same numerical value and same unit.

All requested components are present, values match to at least six significant digits, and the signs correspond. Therefore, the predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for two separate numerical answers.  
Candidate 1 supplies

(a) ν′ = 7/3 ν  
(b) θ′ = 21.8°.

Candidate 2 supplies

(a) ν′ = 7/3 ν  
(b) θ′ = cos⁻¹(13/14).

Part (a) matches exactly.

For part (b) we must compare the numerical values.  
cos⁻¹(13/14) ≈ 21.7868 °.  Expressed to six significant digits this is 21.7868.  
Candidate 1’s 21.8° corresponds to 21.8000 when carried out to six significant digits.  
21.8000 ≠ 21.7868 at the sixth-significant-digit level, so by Rule 4 the two answers are not identical.  
Hence the two candidates’ complete answer sets are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 1.53 × 10¹¹ (solar masses)  
Candidate 2: 1.5 × 10¹¹ (implicitly solar masses)

Both are in the same units, but to test equivalence we must match to 6 significant digits.

Express both with 6 significant digits and the same exponent:
• Candidate 1 → 1.53000 × 10¹¹  
• Candidate 2 → 1.50000 × 10¹¹  

The digits differ (1.53000 vs 1.50000), so they do not match to 6 significant digits.

The question requires three separate results.  
Both candidates supply three answers, but:

1. For part (b) the two formulas differ:
   • Candidate 1: cot θ = (m V₀² b)/k ⇒ θ = arctan(k/(m V₀² b))  
   • Candidate 2: θ = 2 arctan(k/(m V₀² b))

   These are not the same (they differ by a factor 2).

2. For part (c) the differential cross-section formulas also differ:
   • Candidate 1: (k²)/(4 m² V₀⁴ sin⁴ θ)  
   • Candidate 2: (k²)/(4 m² V₀⁴ sin⁴(θ/2))

   The dependence on the scattering angle is different (θ vs θ/2).

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question requires two distinct results (beat-frequency formula and required wall speed).  

1. Beat-frequency formulas:  
   • Candidate 1: ω/(1 − β)  
   • Candidate 2: 2β ω/(1 − β)  
   These differ by the factor 2β, so they are not the same.

2. Required wall speed:  
   • Candidate 1: β ≈ 0.999001 (i.e., v·0.999001)  
   • Candidate 2: v·(999/1001) ≈ v·0.998002  
   These numerical values are different.

Since both sub-answers differ, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Both candidates supply answers for all three sub-parts, but:

Part (a): both give 145 MeV → identical.

Part (b):  
• Candidate 1: 6.787 × 10¹⁰ GeV = 6.787 × 10¹⁹ eV  
• Candidate 2: 6.8 × 10¹⁹ eV = 6.8 × 10¹⁰ GeV  

Comparing to 6 significant digits (rule 4): 6.78700 vs 6.80000 differ in the second significant digit, so they are not equal.

Part (c): the numerical cut-off values they quote (≈6.79 × 10¹⁰ GeV vs ~1 × 10²⁰ eV) differ correspondingly.

Because at least one sub-answer is different, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts (a), (b), and (c).  
Both candidates give an explicit answer for each sub-part, so we must compare every sub-answer.

(a) Horizontal range: both give  R = v₀² sin(2θ)/g.  → identical.

(b) Air-resistance force:  
• Candidate 1: 𝐅 = –ρ A v² 𝐯  (magnitude ∝ v³, no ½, no C_d)  
• Candidate 2: 𝐅 = ½ ρ C_d A v²  (magnitude ∝ v², includes ½ and C_d, sign not shown).  
These expressions are clearly different (different velocity power and constants).  → not equivalent.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two overall answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question is stated in the usual high-energy-physics convention in which masses and energies are both expressed in the same “natural” units (c = 1).  Throughout the problem statement no explicit factor of c or c² ever appears, and m_t is treated interchangeably as an energy (e.g., m_t = 2 m_W).

• Candidate 1 gives  
 E = (5/4) m_t c²  

• Candidate 2 gives  
 E = (5/4) m_t  

With c = 1 these two expressions are numerically identical: the explicit c² in Candidate 1 is simply the conversion factor that is implicitly set to 1 in Candidate 2.  Therefore the two answers correspond to the very same physical value and there is no real ambiguity in the context of the problem.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same numerical factor (5/4), but they differ in the presence of an explicit c²:

• Candidate 1: E = (5/4) m_t c²  
• Candidate 2: E = (5/4) m_t

Because c has units, the two expressions have different dimensions unless one explicitly adopts natural units (c = 1). The problem statement does not mandate natural-unit notation, so the omission/addition of c² introduces an ambiguity in the units. Under Rule 1, such an ambiguity means the answers are not regarded as equivalent.

Both candidates answer the single question “what does the orbit become?”  

• Candidate 1 states “ε′ = 1”.  
In orbital mechanics an eccentricity of 1 corresponds uniquely to a parabolic trajectory.  

• Candidate 2 says the total mechanical energy becomes zero “which corresponds to a parabolic orbit.”  
Energy = 0 is likewise the defining condition for a parabolic orbit.

Thus each candidate is asserting, in different language, that the new orbit is parabolic. They give the same substantive prediction, just expressed through two equivalent criteria (eccentricity = 1 ↔ energy = 0). Therefore the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both supply answers for parts (a), (b) and (c), so we must compare each part.

Part (a)  
R:  Candidate 1’s  
 R = (L² / 2GM m²) [1 + √(1 − 12 GM m³ b / L⁴)]  
is algebraically identical to Candidate 2’s  
 R = [L² + √(L⁴ − 12 GM m³ b)] / (2 GM m²).  
Period T: both give T = 2π m R² / L.  
Stability: both pick the “+” root.  
→ Part (a) agrees.

Part (b)  
Both give δ(t) as a small harmonic oscillation.  
Candidate 2 supplies an explicit frequency  
 ω = √(GM/R³ − 3b / (m R⁵)).  
Candidate 1 writes  
 ω = √(V''ₑff(R …  
and stops—parenthesis never closes, denominator not written.  
Thus the required explicit formula for ω is missing/ambiguous in Candidate 1.  
→ Part (b) not equivalent.

Part (c)  
Because the frequency from part (b) is undefined/ambiguous in Candidate 1, its φ(t) expression (which contains ω) is likewise ambiguous; even aside from the phase-difference issue, this makes the two answers inequivalent.

Since at least one requested component (the explicit ω for the near-circular oscillation) is incomplete in Candidate 1, the two candidates are not equivalent by Rule 2/Rule 8.

The problem has three sub-parts, so both candidates must supply matching answers for (a), (b) and (c).  

• Sub-part (b): both give the same heat-conduction equation (∂T/∂t = k/(ρc) ∇²T), so they match here.  

• Sub-part (c): both give identical expressions for the heat-loss rate and, after algebraic simplification, their temperature-distribution formulas are equivalent, so they also match here.  

• Sub-part (a):  
  – Candidate 1 maps  
    H ↔ J, k ↔ σ, grad T ↔ grad V, cρT ↔ ρ.  
    (No explicit T ↔ V, and grad T is paired with grad V rather than with E.)  
  – Candidate 2 maps  
    H ↔ J, k ↔ σ, T ↔ V, cρT ↔ ρ.  

These mappings are different: Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 do not present the same correspondence for T (and omit/alter the mapping involving the electric field), so their answers to sub-part (a) are not equivalent.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates agree on  
(a) “Insulator”  
(b) High-T: ⟨U²⟩ ∝ T ; Low-T: ⟨U²⟩ constant  

However, part (b) also explicitly asks “Do your results make sense?”  
• Candidate 2 answers this (“yes”).  
• Candidate 1 gives no such statement, so it omits one required piece of the response.

Because Candidate 1 is missing one of the requested answers while Candidate 2 supplies it, the two submissions are not equivalent according to Rule 2.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both sub-problems must be answered.

(a)  Both candidates say: “insulator.”  → same.

(b)  The question asks for the temperature dependence at very high and very low T.

• Candidate 2 states explicitly:
   – high-T:  ⟨U²⟩ ∝ T
   – low-T:  ⟨U²⟩ → constant.

• Candidate 1 gives two separate statements:
   – “⟨U²⟩ ∝ T” (a linear T-dependence)
   – “⟨U²⟩ ≈ (9ħ²)/(4M·ħω_D)” (a T-independent constant).

Thus Candidate 1 also supplies a linear-in-T part and a constant (T-independent) part, matching high-T and low-T behaviour respectively.  The extra numeric factor merely specifies the constant and does not contradict Candidate 2.

Therefore, for each sub-question both candidates provide the same essential answers: (a) insulator; (b) high-T linear in T, low-T constant.

Both candidates give expressions for  

(a) the partition function,  
(b) the specific heat,  
(c) the thermal-average magnetisation, and they both remark that χ ∝ 1/T at high T.  

Comparing term by term:

1. Partition function:  
   Candidate 1: (e^{x}+e^{-x})^N  
   Candidate 2: [2 cosh x]^N = (e^{x}+e^{-x})^N  
   (identical).

2. Specific heat:  
   Candidate 1: kN (μ₀B/kT)² sech²(x) = N μ₀²B²/(kT²) sech²(x)  
   Candidate 2: N μ₀²B²/(k_BT²) sech²(x)  
   (same formula since k = k_B).

3. Mean magnetisation: both give Nμ₀ tanh(x).

4. Susceptibility/high-T limit: both obtain χ ∝ 1/T.

Thus every required sub-answer is the same; the two sets of answers are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question asks for answers to five separate parts (a)–(e).  
Both candidates give formulae for (a)–(d) that are algebraically identical, but for part (e) they predict different final temperatures:

• Candidate 2: Tₚ = 0.01 K

The question asks for two specific quantities:
1. The surface temperature \(T_s\)
2. The central temperature \(T_c\)

Candidate 1 explicitly states
• \(T_s = 22.5\text{ K}\)
• \(T_c = 372\text{ K}\)

Candidate 2 merely lists two numbers (372.5 K and 22.5 K) without labeling which is \(T_s\) and which is \(T_c\).  
Even if we assume the first number corresponds to \(T_c\) and the second to \(T_s\), the values are

• \(T_s = 22.5\text{ K}\)  (matches Candidate 1)  
• \(T_c = 372.5\text{ K}\) (does NOT match Candidate 1’s 372 K; they differ by 0.5 K and hence do not coincide to six significant digits)

If one instead interprets the order as \(T_s = 372.5\text{ K}\) and \(T_c = 22.5\text{ K}\), the assignments are completely reversed relative to Candidate 1.

Therefore, the two sets of answers are not equivalent under Rule 2 (mismatch in correspondences) and Rule 4 (numerical discrepancy).

a) Both give the same cause (ozone absorption of UV) → equivalent.  
c) Both give the same idea (refraction/cylindrical spreading → intensity ∝ 1/R) → equivalent.  

b) Candidate 1: “Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation and carbon dioxide emits infrared radiation, maintaining an energy equilibrium.”  
   Candidate 2: “Stable stratification from temperature inversion and continuous ozone heating.”

These explanations differ: Candidate 1 focuses on radiative balance (ozone-heating + CO₂ IR emission) and does not mention the temperature-inversion/stability mechanism stressed by Candidate 2, whereas Candidate 2 does not mention the CO₂ IR emission stressed by Candidate 1. Since the required explanation elements do not match, their answers for (b) are not equivalent.

The question expects a single numerical estimate (one value).  

Candidate 1 gives 5 × 10²⁵ s⁻¹.  
Candidate 2 gives 1 × 10²⁶ s⁻¹.

Both answers are in the same units, but Rule 4 states that two numeric answers are equivalent only if they match to 6 significant digits after expressing with the same exponent. Expressed with exponent 10²⁵:

• Candidate 1: 5.00000 × 10²⁵  
• Candidate 2: 10.0000 × 10²⁵  

These differ already in the first significant digit, so they are not equal to 6 significant digits. Therefore, according to the rules, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for three distinct results (parts a, b, c).  
Comparing the two candidates for each part:

a)  • Candidate 1 writes densities in terms of μ’s and even places +E_d/kT inside the exponential for H.  
 • Candidate 2 writes μ’s explicitly in terms of densities with a −I term.  
 These forms are not the same.

b)  • Candidate 1: [e] = √[H] (2π m_e kT/h²)³ᐟ² exp(−E_d/2kT)  
 • Candidate 2: [e] = √[H] √(λ_H³ / (λ_p³ λ_e³)) exp(−I/2kT)  
 Using λ_i = h/√(2π m_i kT), the factor in Candidate 2 reduces to (2π m_e kT/h²)³ᐟ⁴ (≈ exponent 3/4), whereas Candidate 1 has exponent 3/2, so the expressions are different.

c)  • Candidate 1: n = 3.3 × 10¹⁶ m⁻³  
 • Candidate 2: 8.9 × 10³ cm⁻³ = 8.9 × 10⁹ m⁻³  
 Values differ by about seven orders of magnitude.

  It never gives a separate expression for the total magnetic moment M(T,H).  
• C2 gives both:  
  M = N μ₀ tanh(μ₀B/k_BT) and  
  U = –N μ₀B tanh(μ₀B/k_BT).

Because C1 omits one of the two required quantities for sub-part (b), the two answers are not fully matching.

(c)  
When present, both give the same functional forms, but the inequivalence in sub-part (b) already breaks overall equivalence per Rule 2.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives expressions for  
(a) the general energy (E = −MH);  
(b) the energy at temperature T (E = −N μ₀ H tanh(μ₀H/kT)) but omits the required total magnetic moment;  
(c) the heat-capacity and entropy.

Candidate 2 supplies only the heat-capacity and entropy formulas and gives nothing for parts (a) and (b).

Because the two candidates do not supply the same set of answers to the multi-part question (Rule 2), their responses are not equivalent.
Both candidates agree on

• Energy in an external field:  E = −M H (or −M B).  
• Equilibrium energy, heat-capacity and entropy formulas (expressions are algebraically identical up to the notational change H↔B, k↔k_B, sech² = 1/cosh²).

However, part (b) of the question asks for TWO quantities: the total magnetic moment M and the energy E.  

– Candidate 2 explicitly gives both M = N μ₀ tanh(μ₀B/k_BT) and the corresponding energy.  
– Candidate 1 only lists the energy expression; the magnetic-moment expression is never written explicitly. Supplying E alone does not fulfill the requirement of giving both quantities.

Because Candidate 1 omits a required component that Candidate 2 provides, the two sets of answers are not equivalent according to Rule 2.

In all three sub-parts both candidates give answers, but for part (b) the numerical temperatures are not identical to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: T = 3 K / 2^{1/3}  ≈ 2.38110 K  
• Candidate 2: T = 2.38 K  → interpreted as 2.38000 K

Comparing 2.38110 and 2.38000, the first difference appears at the fourth decimal place, so the two results do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4). Because at least one sub-answer differs, the complete answer sets are not equivalent.

The question asks for two separate numerical answers.  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both supply two answers, but they differ in the first:

Sub-answer (a) Work W:  
• Candidate 1: 5.2 × 10³ J = 5200 J  
• Candidate 2: 5229 J  
Expressed to six significant digits these are 5.20000 × 10³ and 5.22900 × 10³, which are different (Rule 4).

Sub-answer (b) Final temperature t_f: both give –214 °C, which matches.

Because at least one of the required sub-answers is different, the overall responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 1’s main formula (answer 1) is incomplete:  
Cₚ = R (θ/T)² e^{θ/T} … (no denominator).  
Candidate 2’s formula is k (θ/T)² e^{θ/T}/(e^{θ/T}–1)².

Because Candidate 1 omits the crucial (e^{θ/T}–1)² denominator, the two expressions are not the same. Although both give the same qualitative high- and low-T limits, the full expressions differ, so the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.  

Reasoning:
1. The main formula they give for the vibrational heat capacity differs.  
   • Candidate 1:  C_v = R (θ/T)² e^{θ/T} …  (denominator missing; expression incomplete)  
   • Candidate 2:  C_v = k (θ/T)² e^{θ/T}/(e^{θ/T} – 1)²  

2. Even ignoring the R vs k factor (molar vs molecular basis), Candidate 1 lacks the crucial (e^{θ/T} – 1)² denominator, so the functional form is different.

3. Although both list high-T and low-T limits qualitatively, the core expression required by the problem is not the same.

Therefore they are not equivalent.
The problem asks for four distinct numerical answers.  
Comparing each sub-answer from the two candidates:

a) Number of molecules:  
 Candidate 1: 1 ×10²⁷  
 Candidate 2: 1.9 ×10²⁷  
 Not equal (different by a factor ~1.9).

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the complete answer sets are not identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates supply four answers, but they differ in the numerical values for parts (a) and (b):

(a) 1 × 10²⁷ vs. 2 × 10²⁷ – these differ by a factor of 2, so they are not equal to 6 significant digits.  
(b) 6.2 × 10³ J/mol vs. 6.1 × 10³ J/mol – these also differ.

Since at least one sub-answer is different, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 4).

The question has two sub-parts, so each candidate must supply correct answers for both (a) and (b) to be equivalent.

Sub-part (a):
• Candidate 1 gives c_v = (5/2) n R and c_p = (7/2) n R (per n moles).
• Candidate 2 gives c_v = (5/2) R and c_p = (7/2) R (per mole).

These differ by the factor n; unless n = 1 they are not the same values. Hence the two candidates disagree on sub-part (a).

Since at least one required answer is different, the two overall predictions are not equivalent.

The two proposed formulas for δL differ in structure, symbols, and dimensions.  

• Candidate 1 expresses δL as a product of (δQ / C_W) and a bracketed temperature-derivative term involving L₀, W, ν, g, etc.  
• Candidate 2 states δL = –γ σ Q / (k T), a completely different proportionality involving γ, k, T and no appearance of C_W, ν, g, or derivatives.

These cannot be converted into each other by simple unit or notation changes; they represent distinct, incompatible predictions.

The question has five separate parts (a)-(e).  
Therefore, according to Rule 2 we must compare the two candidates answer-by-answer; every sub-answer must match for the whole set to be equivalent.

Comparison:

(a) Candidate 1: “classical ideal gas”  
    Candidate 2: “ideal gas”  
    → Same idea; match.

(b) Candidate 1: “α < 0” (only states a property)  
    Candidate 2: “liquid water near its freezing point” (specific example)  
    → Different descriptions; not identical.

(c) Candidate 1: “Cp = ∞”  
    Candidate 2: “first-order phase transition (ice melting, etc.)”  
    → Not identical statements, though related.

(d) Candidate 1: “β = 0”  
    Candidate 2: “substance at zero thermal expansion (water at 4 °C)”  
    → Not identical.

(e) Both say the Maxwell relation holds for all systems → match.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, Rule 2 tells us the overall answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same mathematical expression written in a different order.

Candidate 2: Cₚ [ ln(T_f/Tᵢ) − (T_f − Tᵢ)/T_f ]
      = Cₚ [ ln(T_f/Tᵢ) − (1 − Tᵢ/T_f) ]
      = Cₚ [ ln(T_f/Tᵢ) − 1 + Tᵢ/T_f ].

The two bracketed expressions are identical (addition is commutative), so the entropy changes given are the same. Therefore the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1: 3.5 × 10⁴ J  
Candidate 2: 8430 cal  →  8430 cal × 4.184 J/cal ≈ 3.5271 × 10⁴ J

Expressed with six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 ≈ 3.50000 × 10⁴ J  
Candidate 2 ≈ 3.52711 × 10⁴ J

The two numbers differ starting at the third significant digit (3.50000 vs 3.52711), so they are not identical to six significant digits.  
Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.
The two answers use different units, so first convert Candidate 2 to joules:

8437 cal × 4.184 J/cal ≈ 35 300 J.

Candidate 1 gives 3.5 × 10⁴ J = 35 000 J.

Comparing the numerical values to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 3.50000 × 10⁴ J  
• Candidate 2: 3.53004 × 10⁴ J  

They differ starting at the third significant digit, so they are not equivalent under Rule 4.

• Candidate 1:   D₁ = (2 π V / h³) (2m)^{3/2} ε^{1/2}  
• Candidate 2:   D₂ = (V / 2 π² ħ³) (2m)^{3/2} ε^{1/2}

Using h = 2πħ, D₁ = V/(4 π² ħ³)(2m)^{3/2} ε^{1/2}.  
Thus D₂ is twice D₁. The answers differ by a factor 2 ⇒ not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value (the entropy change) with units of cal K⁻¹.  
• Candidate 1 gives 0.61 cal/K.  
• Candidate 2 gives 0.609 cal/K.  

Both use the same unit, so we can compare the numbers directly.

Writing each value to six significant digits:
– Candidate 1: 0.610000  
– Candidate 2: 0.609000  

These differ at the third decimal place and therefore do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4). Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
The two answers give the same numerical value (0.610000 to six significant digits) and the difference in the unit notation is not substantive here, because the problem already specifies the amount as one gram-atomic weight (i.e., one mole).  

Thus 0.61 cal K⁻¹ for that sample and 0.610 cal mol⁻¹ K⁻¹ refer to the same quantity.

The question has three sub-parts, so each candidate must supply three corresponding answers.  
Both candidates do so, but we must check each sub-answer:

1. Definition of z: both give z = Σ e^{-βE}.  → equivalent.
2. Relation of heat capacity to ∂²ln z/∂β²:  
   • Candidate 1: C = (1/(k β²)) ∂²ln z/∂β²  
   • Candidate 2: C = k β² ∂²ln z/∂β²  
   These differ by a factor k² β⁴, so they are not the same.
3. Heat capacity for two-level system: both give C = k(βΔ)² e^{βΔ}/(1+e^{βΔ})² (same expression). → equivalent.

Because sub-answer (b) is different, the sets of answers are not fully identical, hence the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 omits sub-answer (b) (no physical interpretation) while Candidate 2 supplies it, and their equation forms also differ in including “n” versus molar form. Because the required set of answers is not the same, the two responses are not equivalent.

Moreover, the Van der Waals equation written in part (a) differs between the two candidates (Candidate 1 includes an unnecessary factor nRT without the corresponding n-dependence in the a and b terms).  
Because at least one required sub-answer is missing/different, the two overall responses are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Part (a): Candidate 1 gives Q = –aTL₀(1 + 5/2 T α₀) whereas Candidate 2 gives Q = aTL₀(1 – 5/2 T α₀); the overall signs and terms differ, so they are not equal.

• Part (b): The formulas for (∂T/∂L)_S differ in both their prefactors and the signs of several terms.

• Part (c): Both say C_L = C_L(T, L), but agreement here is insufficient because they disagree in (a) and (b).

Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers to both required sub-problems (a) and (b), and in each case the expressions they give are identical:

The two candidates give different explicit formulas:

Candidate 2: Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)

They differ by:
1. A factor of ε₀ (absent in Candidate 1, present in Candidate 2).
2. A numerical factor (1/(4π) versus 1/2).

Unless one explicitly specifies a switch between unit systems (e.g., Gaussian vs. SI) and shows the corresponding conversion, the two expressions are not the same. The problem statement does not indicate such a unit-system switch, so the answers must be considered different.

The two expressions differ by the numerical factor in front of φ²/r²:

• Candidate 2: coefficient = ε₀/2 ≈ 4.4 × 10⁻¹²

Unless one candidate is written in SI while the other is in a completely different unit system (e.g., Gaussian), the coefficients are not the same. With the same unit conventions the two answers are clearly unequal.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ by both a numerical factor and the presence/absence of ε₀, so they cannot be the same formula.

Candidate 1: Δp = φ² / (4 π r²)

Candidate 2: Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)

For them to match, we would need 1/(4 π) = ε₀/2 ⇒ ε₀ = 1/(2 π), which is not true (ε₀ ≈ 8.85 × 10⁻¹² F m⁻¹). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives

Form the ratio (Candidate 1)/(Candidate 2):

= (1/2)·[2 + (α₁+α₂)ΔT]

For the two candidates to be equivalent this ratio must be 1 for all α₁, α₂, ΔT, which is not the case (it equals 1 only if ΔT = 0). Hence the two expressions are generally different.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two proposed formulas are not the same.  
Taking the ratio of Candidate 1 to Candidate 2 gives

R₁ / R₂ = 1 + (α₁ + α₂) ΔT / 2,

Hence, for any non-zero temperature change their numerical values differ, so the answers are inequivalent.

Taking the ratio R₁ / R₂ gives  

R₁ / R₂ = [2 + (α₁ + α₂) ΔT] / 2

which equals 1 only when ΔT = 0. For any finite temperature change, the two radii differ by the factor (2 + (α₁ + α₂) ΔT)/2 ≠ 1.

We have to compare every required sub-answer.

Question parts and candidates’ answers:

(a) mean energy  
• Cand 1:  ⟨E⟩ = ħω/2 + ħω /(e^{α} – 1)  
• Cand 2:  ⟨E⟩ = ħω/2 + ħω e^{-α}  

These are not the same expression; Cand 2 keeps only the first exponential term while Cand 1 keeps the full Bose-Einstein factor. They give different numerical results (except in the extreme α→∞ limit). So the two answers are not identical.

(b) partition function  
• Cand 1:  Z = e^{α_x/2}/(e^{α_x}–1) · e^{α_y/2}/(e^{α_y}–1)  
• Cand 2:  Z = e^{-βħ(ω_x+ω_y)/2} / [(1–e^{-βħω_x})(1–e^{-βħω_y})]  

Cand 1 has the exponent with the opposite sign and so is not equivalent to Cand 2.

(c1) heat capacity  
• Cand 1:  C = k + (15 g² / 8c³) k² T  
• Cand 2:  C = k  

Different results.

(c2) mean position

2. Adiabatic law with its exponent: \(PV^\gamma=\text{const}\) with \(\gamma=\tfrac{4}{3}\).

Candidate 1 explicitly supplies all three relevant pieces (including the pressure-energy relation and \(\gamma=4/3\)).

Because Candidate 2 omits the required pressure-energy relation (and the explicit adiabatic equation), the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question requires three distinct numerical answers:
1. Total number of photons.
2. Energy content in photons.
3. Fermi momentum of the electrons.

Candidate 1 supplies all three quantities (with units).
Candidate 2 supplies only a single quantity (a momentum), omitting the first two required answers.

Because Candidate 2 does not provide the full set of required answers, the two candidates cannot be equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 1: 48.57 °C  
Candidate 2: 48.571 °C  

Both answers use the same unit (°C), so unit comparison passes (Rule 1).  
They are single‐number answers, so Rule 4 applies: compare to 6 significant digits.

Expressing each to 6 significant digits:

• 48.57 °C → 48.5700 (adding trailing zeros)  
• 48.571 °C → 48.5710

The numbers differ at the 5th significant digit (0 vs 1).  
Since they are not identical to 6 significant digits, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give two required limits.

High-T limit:
• Candidate 1: C_v ≈ N k_B  
• Candidate 2: C   ≈ N k_B  
→ identical.

Low-T limit:
• Candidate 1: C_v ≈ (π²/3) Nk_B T / Θ_D.  
  Using Θ_D = ħ ω_D/k_B with ω_D = π ω (1-D Debye cutoff), this becomes  
  C_v = (π/3) N k_B² T / (ħ ω).
• Candidate 2: C   ≈ (π/3) N k_B² T / (ħ ω).

The two low-temperature expressions are therefore the same, and both candidates supply both requested answers.

Hence the two candidates’ predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates choose the same numerical value, 3500, for the melting point.  
• Candidate 1: “3500 °C” (explicit unit)  
• Candidate 2: “3500” (unit omitted, but the question specifies °C, so the implied unit is °C)

There is only one sensible unit in the context, so omission of the unit does not introduce ambiguity (Rule 1). Both answers correspond to the same option in the multiple-choice list (Rule 5).

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates select the same numerical value: 3500.  
Candidate 1 writes “3500 °C,” explicitly including the unit, while Candidate 2 writes “3500” without the unit.  
Because the question itself specifies the unit (°C) for every option, omitting the unit in Candidate 2 does not create ambiguity—the only sensible interpretation is 3500 °C. Thus, the two answers correspond to the same multiple-choice option.

Both candidates select the same numerical value, 5 × 10⁻³.  
The question fixes the unit (cal / s · cm · °C), so candidate 2’s omission of the unit does not introduce ambiguity. Hence the two answers are effectively the same.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question’s options all share the same unit (cal / s·cm °C); the only distinguishing feature is the numerical factor/exponent.  

• Candidate 1: 5 × 10⁻³ cal / s·cm °C  
• Candidate 2: 5 × 10⁻³ (unit omitted)

Since every option in the problem has identical units, omitting the unit does not introduce ambiguity—the numerical value 5 × 10⁻³ unambiguously selects the same choice as Candidate 1. Hence both candidates give the same answer.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates present the same numerical value, 5 × 10⁻³.  
The unit “cal / s·cm °C” is explicitly written in Candidate 1 but omitted in Candidate 2.  
Because every option in the multiple-choice list carries exactly this same unit, leaving the unit out does not introduce any ambiguity—the only distinguishing element among the choices is the power of ten. Consequently, both answers point unambiguously to the same choice.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Part (a) differs:

• Candidate 1: U = U₀ + nE   
• Candidate 2: U = nE (no U₀ term)

Because an additive base energy U₀ is present in one answer and absent in the other, the two sets of answers are not identical.  
Since at least one sub-answer disagrees, the candidates are not equivalent overall (Rule 2).

The problem asks for three separate quantities:  
(a) the internal energy U,  
(b) the entropy S (asymptotic form),  
(c) the number of defects n.  

Candidate 1 supplies explicit answers for all three sub-questions.  
Candidate 2 supplies only one formula, covering sub-question (c) alone.

Rule 2 states that if a question requires multiple answers and one candidate gives fewer answers than required while the other gives them all, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Therefore the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for two numerical estimates, (a) and (b).  
Both candidates supply both numbers, so we compare each pair:

(a) τ  
• Candidate 1: 4 × 10⁻⁹ s  
• Candidate 2: 1.4 × 10⁻¹⁰ s  
These differ by almost two orders of magnitude; they do not match to 6 significant digits.

(b) n  
• Candidate 1: 6 × 10³⁵ m⁻³  
• Candidate 2: 5.8 × 10³⁵ m⁻³  
These are close but still differ in the third significant digit (6.0 vs 5.8), so they also fail the 6-digit criterion.

The question requires five distinct numerical answers (heat-loss rate plus four entropy rates).  

• Candidate 1 supplies all five values.  
• Candidate 2 supplies only four entropy rates and omits the heat-loss rate; moreover, the first value it gives is in W/K, not W, so it cannot be interpreted as the missing heat-loss rate.

Because the sets of answers differ in both number and content, the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: 1.45 × 10¹³ kWhr (unit explicitly given)  
• Candidate 2: 1.45 × 10¹³ (no unit stated)

Because Candidate 2 omits the required unit, its answer is ambiguous relative to what the question demands. According to Rule 1, omission of a necessary unit makes the two answers inequivalent even though the numerical values match.

The question requires a single numerical answer (tree height).  
Candidate 1 gives “≈ 1.5 km,” i.e. 1500 m.  
Candidate 2 gives 1479 m.

Converting to the same unit (metres) and comparing with 6-significant-digit precision (Rule 4):

1500.00 m ≠ 1479.00 m

The two numbers differ already in the third significant digit, so they are not equivalent.

The question has two sub-parts and therefore requires two separate answers.  

1. For part (a) both candidates give the same formula:  
   ⟨(E – ⟨E⟩)²⟩ = k T² C_V.

2. For part (b) they do not provide the same result.  
   • Candidate 1 evaluates the relative variance:  
     (⟨E²⟩ – ⟨E⟩²)/⟨E⟩² ∼ 1/N.  
   • Candidate 2 evaluates the relative standard deviation:  
     ΔE/⟨E⟩ ∼ 1/√N.  

These are different quantities (variance ratio vs. standard-deviation ratio) and are not mathematically identical.  
According to Rule 2, because at least one sub-answer differs, the candidates are not equivalent.

The problem has two sub-questions:  
(a) the partition function Z;  
(b) the average number of open links ⟨n⟩ in the limit ε ≫ τ (β ε ≫ 1).

Candidate 1  
(a) Z = (1 – e^{-β(N+1) ε}) / (1 – e^{-β ε})  
(b) ⟨n⟩ ≈ 1 / (e^{β ε} – 1)

Candidate 2  
(a) Z = (1 – e^{-(N+1) ε/τ}) / (1 – e^{-ε/τ})  
(b) ⟨n⟩ = e^{-ε/τ}

Comparison  

(a) Using β = 1/τ, the two expressions for Z are identical; therefore the answers to part (a) are equivalent.

(b) For ε ≫ τ (large β ε):  
 Candidate 1: 1/(e^{β ε} – 1) ≈ e^{-β ε} (because e^{β ε} ≫ 1).  
 Candidate 2: e^{-ε/τ} = e^{-β ε}.  
Thus, in the stated limit, both give the same leading expression e^{-β ε}. The slight difference (the “–1” in the denominator) vanishes in the limit required by the question, so the answers are mathematically equivalent in that limit.

Since the two candidates supply answers for both sub-questions and those answers are equivalent, the overall responses are equivalent.
Both sub-parts must be compared.

(a)  Partition function  
Candidate 1:  Z = (1 – e^{-β(N+1)ε}) /(1 – e^{-βε})  
Candidate 2:  Z = (1 – e^{-(N+1)ε/τ}) /(1 – e^{-ε/τ})  

Because β = 1/τ, the two formulas are exactly the same. Thus (a) is equivalent.

(b)  Average number of open links in the limit ε ≫ τ  
Candidate 1:  ⟨n⟩ ≈ 1 /(e^{βε} – 1) = 1 /(e^{ε/τ} – 1)  
Candidate 2:  ⟨n⟩ ≈ e^{-ε/τ}

For ε ≫ τ, e^{ε/τ} is very large, so  
1 /(e^{ε/τ} – 1) ≈ 1 /e^{ε/τ} = e^{-ε/τ}.  
Hence Candidate 1’s expression reduces to Candidate 2’s expression in the stated limit. Thus both answers give the same result required by the question.

Since both parts (a) and (b) are equivalent under the specified limit, the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both sub-questions must match.

(a)  Partition function  
 C1:  (1 − e^{−β(N+1)ε}) /(1 − e^{−βε})  
 C2:  (1 − e^{−(N+1)ε/τ}) /(1 − e^{−ε/τ})  
With β = 1/τ these are the same formula, so part (a) matches.

(b)  Average number of open links in the limit ε ≫ τ  
 C1:  ⟨n⟩ ≈ 1/(e^{βε} − 1)  
 C2:  ⟨s⟩ = e^{−ε/τ} = e^{−βε}

For large βε (ε ≫ τ),  
 1/(e^{βε} − 1) = e^{−βε}/(1 − e^{−βε}) ≈ e^{−βε}.  
Thus C1 and C2 give the same leading-order result demanded by the problem’s limit. They therefore agree for the requested quantity.

Since both parts are equivalent, the candidates’ answers are equivalent overall.

The question has four sub-parts.  
For (a)–(c) both candidates give exactly the same formulas.  
For (d) they both give a formula for the final temperature τ_f, but:

Candidate 2: τ_f = [τ³ – (5 N_s μ²B² τ_D³)/(8 π⁴ N_p τ²)]^{1/3}
             = τ [1 – (5 N_s μ²B² τ_D³)/(8 π⁴ N_p τ⁵)]^{1/3}

The two expressions differ by a factor of π² in the denominator (π² vs π⁴).  
Since at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not identical.

Candidate 1 supplies two separate required results:  
• the Carnot efficiency η = (v_g − v_ℓ) Δp / L_v (part (a)), and  
• the expression dp_v/dT = L_v / [T (v_g − v_ℓ)] (part (b), plus an equivalent entropy form).

Candidate 2 supplies only the second of these results: dp_v/dT = L_v / [T (v_g − v_ℓ)], and gives no expression for the efficiency.

Because the original problem asks for both (a) the efficiency and (b) dp_v/dT, Candidate 2 is missing a required answer. Under Rule 2, when one candidate omits a required part, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same two required results:

1. Efficiency: η = Δp (v_g − v_ℓ)/L_v
2. Clausius-Clapeyron: dp_v/dT = L_v / [T (v_g − v_ℓ)]

Candidate 1 also lists an additional relation ( (s_g−s_ℓ)/(v_g−v_ℓ) ) that is merely another form of the same Clausius-Clapeyron formula and does not contradict the answers. Since the required answers are identical in both candidates, the predictions are equivalent.

The problem has three sub-parts.  
Both candidates give answers for (a) and (b) that coincide.

For sub-part (c) the question explicitly asks “Which gives a better result for air?”  
• Candidate 2 states plainly: “Adiabatic case gives a better result for air.”  
• Candidate 1 merely lists the two numerical values 280 m/s (isothermal) and 331 m/s (adiabatic) without actually saying which one is better. The requested comparative judgment is not made explicitly.

Because Candidate 1 omits an explicit answer to sub-part (c), while Candidate 2 supplies it, the two responses are not fully equivalent under Rule 2, which requires complete answers to every sub-problem.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has three explicit sub-parts.  
For equivalence, both candidates must give matching answers for (a), (b-isothermal), (b-adiabatic), and (c).

1. Part (a)  
   • Both give v² = dp/dρ → equivalent.

2. Part (b)  
   • Isothermal:  
     – Cand 1: v² = RT/m.  
     – Cand 2: v = √(RT/M) → v² = RT/M.  
     Symbols differ (m vs M) and dimensional consistency is uncertain; already a possible mismatch.  
   • Adiabatic:  
     – Cand 1: v² = γRT/m.  
     – Cand 2: v = √(γRT/M) → v² = γRT/M.  
   So even ignoring the symbol issue, the two do not exactly match in written form.

   In addition, Cand 1 supplies specific numerical values (280 m/s, 331 m/s) that Cand 2 does not give, so the answers are not identical.

3. Part (c)  
   • Cand 1 never explicitly states which result is better; Cand 2 explicitly says “Adiabatic.”  
   Therefore Cand 1 omits a required explicit answer.

Because at least one required sub-answer is missing/does not match, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are clearly different:

 It does not involve the number density n.

• Candidate 2 is proportional to n and has no factors of h, no (1 + V/τ) term, and no τ²; after simplifying its √τ /√τ it becomes (e A n/√(2 π m)) exp[−(V−μ)/τ], i.e. independent of τ aside from the Boltzmann exponential.

Because the dependence on n, τ, m, h (and even the sign) is different, the two proposed currents cannot be the same formula under any straightforward identification of parameters. Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

   • Candidate 1 contains h (Planck’s constant) and an overall negative sign.  
   • Candidate 2 contains neither h nor any negative sign but does include the electron number density n and a √(2π m τ) in the denominator.

Because the structures, prefactors, and even the sign differ, no simple algebraic manipulation can make the two formulas identical. Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for three separate expressions (E, C and S) as functions of temperature in the sub-critical region.  
Candidate 1 supplies three explicit formulas in terms of N and τ/τ_E with the integrals already carried out (ζ–functions).  
Candidate 2 gives three different formulas in terms of V and an unevaluated integral; no attempt is made to rewrite them in terms of N or τ_E.

Because:

1. Each corresponding expression (energy, heat capacity, entropy) is algebraically different between the two candidates; one depends on N and τ_E while the other depends on V and an integral factor.
2. There is no straightforward identity showing the two sets are the same without additional steps that Candidate 2 did not provide (Rule 1, Rule 8).
3. Both candidates give all three required quantities, but the actual formulas are not identical (Rule 2).

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are structurally different:

1. The exponential factors have opposite signs ( e^{-ε₀/(…)}  vs  e^{+ε₀/(…)} ).
2. Candidate 1 involves two pressure-like symbols, p₀ and p, and the whole expression is a rational function whose denominator is squared.  
   Candidate 2 involves only one pressure symbol P and its denominator is not a perfect square.
3. Even allowing for possible symbol relabeling (τ ↔ k_B T, p ↔ P), the algebraic forms cannot be rearranged into one another.

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ in both functional form and parameter definitions:

• Candidate 1 involves the constants p₀ and p and contains the factor ( … )² in the denominator, with Boltzmann factors e^{−ε₀/(k_BT)} (negative exponent).

• Candidate 2 depends only on P and has a denominator with a quadratic polynomial 1 + ( … )P + ( … )P², with Boltzmann factors e^{+ε₀/(k_BT)} (positive exponent).

Because the algebraic structures (square vs. quadratic polynomial), signs in the exponents, and even the set of variables differ, there is no way to map one formula into the other simply by relabeling symbols. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two formulas are not the same.

Main differences:

1. Exponential signs  
   • Candidate 1 has 1 + e^{−ε₀/(2 τ)}.  
   • Candidate 2 has e^{+ε₀/(kT)} + e^{+ε₀/(2kT)}.  
   The signs of the exponents are opposite, so the temperature dependence is different.

2. Missing term  
   Candidate 1 lacks the e^{±ε₀/(kT)} (full-energy) term that Candidate 2 contains.

3. Denominator constants  
   Candidate 1 uses p₀ in the denominator, whereas Candidate 2 uses 1.  Even if p₀ were set to 1, the mismatch in exponential terms would remain.

Because the expressions cannot be made identical by any simple redefinition of symbols, the two candidates are inequivalent.
The two expressions have different functional forms:

Candidate 1:
f = [p (1 + e^{−ε₀/(2τ)})] / [p₀ + p (1 + e^{−ε₀/(2τ)})]

(after dividing by p₀ this becomes f = P[1 + e^{−ε₀/(2τ)}]/[1 + P(1 + e^{−ε₀/(2τ)})]).

Candidate 2:
θ = P ( e^{+ε₀/(k_BT)} + e^{+ε₀/(2k_BT)} ) / [1 + P ( e^{+ε₀/(k_BT)} + e^{+ε₀/(2k_BT)} )].

Key differences:
• Candidate 1 contains 1 + e^{−ε₀/(2T)} in the bracket, whereas Candidate 2 contains e^{+ε₀/(T)} + e^{+ε₀/(2T)}—different terms and opposite sign in the exponent.
• Candidate 1 uses a reference pressure p₀, which disappears only after rescaling; Candidate 2 does not include this constant.
Thus the two formulas are not mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different formulas:

• For odd m:  
  – Candidate 1: (2 H_{m−1} + 1/m)/(2m − 1)  
  – Candidate 2: 2 H_m − 1/m

• For even m:  
  – Candidate 1: (2 H_{(m−2)/2} + 2/m)/(2m − 1)  
  – Candidate 2: 2 H_{m/2} − 2/m

The expressions differ both in their numerators and in having a denominator (2m − 1) vs. none. Substituting any sample value of m yields unequal numerical results. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different algebraic expressions.

For odd m  
• Candidate 1: 𝓗 = (1/(2m – 1))·(2 H_{m−1} + 1/m)  
• Candidate 2: 𝓗 = 2 H_{m} – 1/m  
The factors (1/(2m – 1)) versus 1, and H_{m−1} versus H_{m}, make the formulas plainly unequal.  
Example m = 3: Candidate 1 → 0.667 ; Candidate 2 → 3.333.

For even m  
• Candidate 1: (1/(2m – 1))·(2 H_{(m−2)/2} + 2/m)  
• Candidate 2: 2 H_{m/2} – 2/m  
Again the denominators and the harmonic-number indices differ.

Since the expressions disagree in both cases, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different formulas.

• Candidate 1 multiplies each numerator by the factor 1 / (2m − 1), whereas Candidate 2 lacks this factor entirely.  
• Although the harmonic‐number indices for the even case coincide (H_{(m-2)/2} = H_{m/2 − 1}), the presence versus absence of the overall factor makes the numerical values different.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The question has two sub-parts.

Sub-part (a):  
• Candidate 1 gives eigenvalue 2 q (p + n – 1).  
• Candidate 2 gives eigenvalue 2 q (p + n).  
These expressions are clearly different.

Sub-part (b): although the two formulas can be shown to be algebraically the same, equivalence in (b) cannot compensate for the discrepancy in (a).

Because at least one required answer is different, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 answers both parts (a) and (b).  
Candidate 2 gives only a single formula – a dimension formula that (after algebra) equals candidate 1’s part (b), but it supplies nothing for part (a). Because the problem asks for two separate answers and candidate 2 omits one of them, the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: λ = λ(E^F,ω^{(p−1)/2+i})

Since these expressions are not the same (Candidate 1 has the extra ((p − 1)/2)·p^{n−1} term), the answers are not equivalent. Both give μ = 0, but disagreement on λ is enough to make the overall predictions unequal (Rule 2).

• Candidate 2:   μ(G₁+G₂;x)=μ(G₁,x)·μ(G₂,x−n₁)

The two expressions differ in:
1. the arguments fed into μ(G₁,·) (x−n₂ vs. x),
2. the presence of an extra rational prefactor in Candidate 1.

Because of these differences, the two candidates are not mathematically equivalent.

The two candidates differ for the case “ $n \neq 3^{m}$ ”:

The two candidates give different explicit expressions.

• Candidate 1 uses the factor hα(P) and explicitly sets (Hα⁻¹)_{ii}=0.

• Candidate 2 uses α^{s(P)} in place of hα(P) and gives no separate statement for i=j (the sum could be non-zero or zero depending on conventions).

Because the weight factor in each summand is written differently and the diagonal case is treated differently/ambiguously, the two formulas cannot be guaranteed to coincide.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two formulas are structurally different.

1.  Sign exponent  
   • Candidate 1 uses (|E(P)| – 1)/2.  
   • Candidate 2 uses “number of non-matching edges”.  
   For a standard alternating co-augmenting path of odd length 2m + 1, the number of non-matching edges is m + 1, so the two exponents differ by 1, producing an overall minus sign disagreement for each path.

2.  Diagonal entries  
   • Candidate 1 explicitly sets (Hα⁻¹)_{ii}=0.  
   • Candidate 2 gives a single formula with no such explicit condition; it may or may not yield 0, but this is left unspecified.

3.  Notation for the path weight  
   • Candidate 1 uses hα(P).  
   • Candidate 2 uses ∏_{e∈P}(Hα)_e.  
   These could coincide, but this is not stated.

Because of the systematic sign difference and the mismatch (or at least ambiguity) on diagonal entries, the two expressions are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions coincide term-by-term: 

• Both sums are taken over the same set of co-augmenting mixed paths  𝖨𝗆_{i→j}.  
• The sign factors are identical: (–1)^{(|E(P)|–1)/2} in Candidate 1 equals (–1)^{(ℓ(P)–1)/2} in Candidate 2 because |E(P)| = ℓ(P).  
• In the weight of a path, h_α(P) in Candidate 1 is exactly the product of the edge weights w_α(e) used in Candidate 2; it is merely a notational difference.  
• For i = j, Candidate 1 states the value is 0 explicitly, while Candidate 2’s single formula also yields 0 because the set 𝖨𝗆_{i→i} is empty, so the sum is zero. Hence the two prescriptions agree on the diagonal as well.

Therefore the two candidates describe the same matrix entry.
The two candidates give distinctly different formulas.

• Candidate 1 uses terms involving 2^{a_i} and includes only up-to-pairwise products.  
• Candidate 2 is a simple product of (a_i + 1) with no powers of 2 and involves all n factors.

Since the algebraic expressions are clearly not the same (and there is no identity that would make them equal for all integers a_i), the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:

Even for n = 1, Candidate 1 yields 2^{a_1} while Candidate 2 yields a_1, which differ unless a_1 happens to satisfy a_1 = 2^{a_1}. For n ≥ 2 the discrepancy is even clearer. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different expressions:

The two candidates give the same formula, differing only in notation:  

• Candidate 1 writes the tree‐count symbol with an explicit “; ω” to show dependence on the edge‐weight function.  
• Candidate 2 writes the same symbol without that explicit “; ω”.

Because the question itself specifies that the counts in the formula are the “weighted spanning tree counts,” the natural interpretation of T(Γ) in Candidate 2 is precisely that weighted count. Thus both answers represent

 R_{ij} = T(Γ / ij, ω) ⁄ T(Γ, ω).

Hence the two predictions are equivalent.
The two candidates give the same formula up to notation.

• Candidate 1:  R_{ij} = T(Γ/ij; ω) / T(Γ; ω)  
• Candidate 2:  R_{ij} = T(Γ/ij) / T(Γ)

The question involves an electrical network (Γ, ω); in this context the spanning-tree count T(·) is normally understood to be the weighted count determined by ω. Candidate 1 writes that dependence explicitly with “; ω”, while Candidate 2 omits it but otherwise has the identical numerator and denominator. The omission is only a notational abbreviation; no mathematical difference is introduced. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 2:  
h = − ([F:ℚ]/2) ζF(−1)  +  ([F:ℚ]/2) ζF′(−1)  +  Σv log Nv

The dependence on ζF(−1) and ζF′(−1) is completely different (a ratio in Candidate 1 vs. separate factors in Candidate 2), and the coefficients of the log Nv terms differ. Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

These expressions are not transformable into each other by simple algebraic manipulation (unless ζF(−1)=0, which is not the case), so the predictions are inequivalent.

Because the binomial coefficient C(h+s−1, s−1) is generally not equal to s^h (they coincide only in the special case h = 1), the two expressions differ for most values of h and s. Hence the candidates are inequivalent.

Even if ω(C)=hα(→C), 2^{s(X′)} Re(∏ ω(C)) is not, in general, equal to the product of the individual (ω(C)+ω(C)^{−1}) factors. Therefore the two proposed formulas are not algebraically identical.

• Candidate 1: 32 n³ + 16 n² − 8 n (depends on n)  
• Candidate 2: 1664 (constant)

Since one answer varies with n and the other is a fixed number, they can coincide at most for a specific n, but not identically for all n. Therefore they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 provides a polynomial expression 32 n³ + 16 n² − 8 n (depends on n), while Candidate 2 gives a fixed numeric value 1664 (independent of n). These cannot represent the same quantity for all n. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same answer for part (i) (“2n − 1”).  

For part (ii):

• Candidate 2:   e_c = C( n(n−1)/2 ,  i − n )

• Candidate 1:   e_c = C( n(n−1)/2 ,  i − n )  −  n·C( n−1 ,  i − n )

These two formulas differ by the term n·C( n−1 ,  i − n ).  
For i = 2n − 1 (the smallest allowed value), that binomial term equals n, so the two candidates give different numerical results. Hence their answers to part (ii) are not the same, and by Rule 2 the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for two separate quantities.  
Candidate 1 gives:

1. ρ_c(G ∘ K₁) = 2n − 1  
2. e_c(K_n ∘ K₁, i) = C(n(n−1)/2, i − n) − n C(n−1, i − n)

Candidate 2 gives:

1. ρ_c(G ∘ K₁) = n  
2. e_c(K_n ∘ K₁, i) = C( C(n, 2), i − n)

For part (i) the answers differ (2n − 1 vs n). Because at least one required sub-answer is different, under Rule 2 the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates present entirely different probability density functions:

• Candidate 1 gives a sum that depends on L and is independent of \tilde{N}_o.  
• Candidate 2 gives a simple exponential that depends on \tilde{N}_o and has no dependence on L (aside from any implicit contextual meaning).

Since the functional forms, parameter dependencies, and numerical factors differ, the two PDFs cannot be the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give completely different functional forms (and even different parameter sets) for the PDF of 𝒰_L:

• Candidate 1: a weighted sum of Gamma–type terms with factors (1/2)^L, binomial coefficients, powers of L and ζ, etc.; no dependence on 𝛏̃_N_o.  
• Candidate 2: a simple exponential distribution (scale 𝛏̃_N_o).

Since these expressions cannot be algebraically identical for general L and 𝛏̃_N_o, the answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for two explicit expressions for dmg(G; s) under two distinct regimes of s.  
Candidate 1 gives:

(i) 2 ≤ s ≤ ℓ → (∑_{i=1}^{s} k_i) − 1  
(ii) s > ℓ → n − 2

Candidate 2 gives:

(i) “answer 1” = ∑_{i=s}^{ℓ} k_i  
(ii) “answer 2” = 1

The expressions in (i) are clearly different: ∑_{i=1}^{s} vs ∑_{i=s}^{ℓ}, and one subtracts 1 while the other does not.  
The expressions in (ii) are also different: n − 2 vs 1.

Thus the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two lists of Laplacian eigenvalues (with multiplicities) are clearly different.

• Candidate 1 contains the eigenvalue n (with multiplicity m − 1) and a whole family m + 2 − 2 cos(π j / n) (one for each j = 1,…,n − 1, each with multiplicity 1).

• Candidate 2 instead lists the eigenvalue m (with multiplicity n − 1) and does not include that cosine family at all; it also assigns different multiplicities to the common eigenvalue m + n.

Since the multisets of eigenvalues/multiplicities do not match in general, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two proposed closed-form products are not the same.

Comparing the individual infinite-product factors shows that their exponent multiplicities differ (for example, exponents congruent to 2 or 4 mod 6 appear in Candidate 1 but not in Candidate 2, while exponents congruent to 1, 3, 5 mod 6 are weighted differently).  
Since these multiplicities cannot cancel out to give identical products, the two expressions are inequivalent.

• Candidate 2 answers only “m · μ”, i.e. the product of two symbols, without identifying them with the requested quantities or matching the difference given in Candidate 1.

The problem asks for all primitive solutions for each of the four values α = 1, 2, 3, 4.  

• Candidate 1 supplies a full list of solutions for every α (each with ± z).  
• Candidate 2 gives only a single solution tuple, covering just α = 4 and only one sign for z.

Because Candidate 2 omits the required solutions for α = 1, 2, 3 and even the negative-z companion for α = 4, the two answer sets are not the same.

Both candidates list tuples (α, x, y, z) for α = 1,2,3,4.  

• Candidate 1 writes “±” for the z–coordinate, thereby representing two solutions (one with z positive and one with z negative) for each α.  
• Candidate 2 lists only the positive-z variant for each α and does not include the corresponding negative-z solutions.

Because the question asks for “all” primitive integer solutions (and does not restrict z to be positive), Candidate 2 supplies fewer solutions than required, whereas Candidate 1 includes both signs. Therefore the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 2:  𝒟(Q)= Y / Z

These expressions are plainly not algebraically identical, and a numerical substitution (e.g., a=0.5, Q=1) shows they yield different values (≈0.616 vs. ≈0.780). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give completely different formulas.

• Candidate 1:  𝒟(Q)= 4 (Y+Z)(X+aZ) / [X+Y+Z(a+1)]²  
• Candidate 2:  𝒟(Q)= Y / Z

These expressions are not algebraically identical, and a numerical test with typical parameter values (e.g., a = 0.5, Q = 1) yields different numerical results. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
The two expressions are not the same.

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
E₁ = x^{n(m−1)} (x + m)^{n}.

Take n = 1 (any m ≥ 3). Then  
E₁ = x^{m−1}(x + m) = x^{m} + m x^{m−1}.

Candidate 2 for n = 1 is  
E₂ = x [(x−1)^{m−1} + (−1)^{m}(x−1)].  

For m = 3 (the smallest allowed), this becomes  
E₂ = x[(x−1)^{2} − (x−1)] = x(x^{2} − 3x + 2) = x^{3} − 3x^{2} + 2x.

Comparing the coefficients of x^{2}: E₁ gives +3, whereas E₂ gives −3.  
Since they differ even for this simple case, the two formulas cannot be equivalent for all n, m, x.

Therefore Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are inequivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent. A quick check with small values (e.g., n = 1, m = 3) already yields different polynomials, and structurally candidate 1 has only n + 1 terms, whereas candidate 2 generally expands to many more terms. Hence they cannot be the same expression.

The question requests a single numerical function (or value) giving the count of such permutations for every integer n ≥ 2.

• Candidate 1: ⌈(n+1)/2⌉ – a function of n.  
• Candidate 2: 1 – a constant, independent of n.

For n = 2, candidate 1 gives ⌈3/2⌉ = 2, while candidate 2 gives 1, so they already differ. Hence the predictions are not the same for the domain required.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions 

Candidate 1: ⌈(n + 1)/2⌉  
Candidate 2: 2^{⌊n/2⌋}

are generally different.  
For example, at n = 4:

• Candidate 2 → 2^{⌊4/2⌋} = 2^{2} = 4

Since they yield different values (and likewise for many other n), the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical quantity as a function of n (n ≥ 2).  
Candidate 1 gives that quantity as ⌈(n + 1)/2⌉, which depends on n.

Since these two expressions are different for all n > 3 (and are only accidentally equal for n = 2, 3), the two answers are not the same overall.

The two candidates give different numerical results for the same admissible values of \(s\) and \(d\).

Example counter-example (allowed since \(s\) odd, \(d\) even, \(\gcd(s,d)=1\)):
• \(s = 7,\; d = 2\)

Candidate 1:
 \(|\mathcal{BC}_{(7,9,11)}| = \sum_{i=0}^{3} \binom{3}{\lfloor i/2 \rfloor}\binom{4-\lfloor i/2 \rfloor}{3-i}=22\)

Candidate 2:
 \((s-1)(s+2d-1)/4 = (7-1)(7+4-1)/4 = 6·10/4 = 15\)

Since 22 ≠ 15, the expressions cannot be equivalent.  
(Other test cases such as \(s=1,d=2\) also disagree.)

Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates propose different formulas:

Candidate 2: the quadratic expression \((s-1)(s+2d-1)/4\).

• Candidate 1 gives 13.  
• Candidate 2 gives 12.

Since a single valid instance already shows different results, the two candidates cannot be equivalent.

The two formulas coincide only in very special accidental cases (e.g., if the t_i satisfy that equation with s = 1/(1+B)), but in general they give different values. Therefore they are not equivalent answers according to the rules (Rule 4 and Rule 8).

The two expressions are structurally different.

Candidate 1:

Candidate 2:
q^{h_L}(…)\,\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1-q^{k})}

Even ignoring the different power in the “(1–q^{…})” prefactor (which already disagrees for odd p), Candidate 1 contains an extra infinite factor
∏_{k}(1+q^{k-1/2})/(1-q^{k}),
which is not equal to 1. Therefore the two proposed characters are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives  

char = q^{h_L} (1 − q^{p/2}) (1 + ½(1+(-1)^p) q^{p/2}) ∏_{k=1}^{∞} (1+q^{k-1/2}) (1−q^{k})^{-2}.  

Simplifying the prefactor:
• if p is even this equals q^{h_L}(1−q^{p})∏_{k}(1+q^{k-1/2})(1−q^{k})^{-2};  
• if p is odd it equals q^{h_L}(1−q^{p/2})∏_{k}(1+q^{k-1/2})(1−q^{k})^{-2}.

Candidate 2 gives  

char = q^{h_L}(q^{p};q^{p})_{∞}(q)_{∞}^{-2}  
  = q^{h_L} ∏_{n=1}^{∞}(1−q^{pn})(1−q^{k})^{-2}.

Thus the two expressions have the same denominator but completely different numerators:  
• Candidate 2’s numerator is ∏_{n}(1−q^{pn});  
• Candidate 1’s numerator is (1−q^{p}) or (1−q^{p/2}) times ∏_{k}(1+q^{k-1/2}).  
These are not equal (note in particular the half-integer powers in Candidate 1’s product, absent in Candidate 2).

Therefore the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives
 mult(R/I^s) = mult(R/I)·C(h+s–1, s–1).

Candidate 2 gives
 mult(R/I^s) = mult(R/I)·s^h.

In general, for h ≥ 2 the binomial coefficient C(h+s–1, s–1) differs from s^h (e.g. h = 2, s = 2 gives 3 vs 4). The two formulas coincide only in the special case h = 1, but the question allows any height h. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the formula

mult(R/I^s) = mult(R/I) × [binomial coefficient in the top (s + h − 1)].

Candidate 1 uses  binom(h + s − 1, s − 1), whereas Candidate 2 uses  binom(s + h − 1, h).  
Since for any n and k we have  binom(n, k) = binom(n, n − k), and here n = s + h − 1 with k = s − 1 so n − k = h, the two binomial coefficients are identical.

Therefore the two answers are mathematically the same.

• Candidate 2 gives  
 P = 1 – (1 – 1/4)¹ = 1 – 3/4 = 1/4.

Since 0 ≠ 1/4, the formulas cannot be equivalent (and they will differ for other values as well).

• Candidate 2: Q₂ = (1 − 1/2²)^{1} = 3/4 = 0.75.

The triple-sum generating function is to be written as a single q–series.

• Candidate 1 gives a linear combination of three quotients of J–functions:
  J_6^5J_{28,60}/(J_3^2J_4^2J_{12}^2) + 2q³ J_2²J_3J_{12}J_{12,60}/(J_1J_4³J_6) – q⁴ J_6^5J_{8,60}/(J_3^2J_4^2J_{12}^2).

• Candidate 2 gives one reciprocal product:
  1 /((q;q⁴)_∞ (q²;q⁴)_∞ (q³;q⁴)_∞).

Check the first non-trivial q-coefficients.

– For Candidate 2, set  
  P(q) =(q;q⁴)_∞(q²;q⁴)_∞(q³;q⁴)_∞  
  = (1−q)(1−q²)(1−q³)+O(q⁴)=1−q−q²+q⁴+…  
  Hence 1/P(q)=1+q+2q²+… ; the coefficient of q is +1.

– For Candidate 1, the first term contains only J_3, J_4, J_6,… whose lowest powers are q³, q⁴, q⁶, so its expansion is 1+O(q³).  
  The second term is multiplied by q³, so begins at q³.  
  The third term is multiplied by q⁴, so begins at q⁴.  
  Therefore the overall coefficient of q (and q²) is 0.

Since the q-coefficient of order 1 differs (Candidate 1: 0, Candidate 2: 1), the two expressions are not the same.

Both candidates give a 6-tuple (v, k, λ₁, λ₂, m, n), so Rule 2 applies: every component must match.

Already the first component differs:

• Candidate 2: v = q^{4e} (a single power)

Since these two expressions are not the same, the whole 6-tuples cannot be identical. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

 v = q^{2e}.  
These are not the same (take q = 2, e = 2 to see 120 ≠ 16). Since even the first parameter already disagrees, the sets of parameters are not identical, hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The numerical value of π / 4 is approximately 0.785398163…

Candidate 1: 0.78539815  
Candidate 2: π/4  ≈ 0.785398163…

Comparing to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 0.785398  
• Candidate 2 → 0.785398  

They match to 6 significant digits, so the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical answer (the number of labeled graphs that meet the given degree sequence).  

Candidate 1 gives: 15  
Candidate 2 gives: 105  

Both are plain numbers (same unit: “count”), but 15 ≠ 105. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give numeric answers to the single-valued limit.

• Candidate 1: 0.63662  
  (written with 5 significant digits; expressed to 6 significant digits it is 0.636620)

• Candidate 2: 2 / π  
  2/π = 0.636619772… ; rounded (or expressed) to 6 significant digits it is 0.636620

The two values coincide to 6 significant digits (0.636620), so by Rule 4 the answers are considered equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.  
Expressed to six significant digits, Candidate 1’s “3.7” becomes 3.70000, whereas Candidate 2’s log₂(13) is approximately 3.70044.  
Because they differ within the first six significant digits, Rule 4 declares them inequivalent.

Candidate 1 supplies only a single value “14” (presumably minutes), while the question requires two distinct time-difference answers (one for each travel direction). Candidate 2 provides two separate numerical answers for the required cases (−7.73 min and 14.4 min). Because Candidate 1 fails to give both requested answers, the two candidate outputs are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question asks for an angle. Angles can reasonably be expressed either in degrees or in radians.  

• Candidate 1 gives “60.0” with no unit specified, leaving the unit ambiguous.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly gives “60°”, clearly in degrees.  

Because one answer omits the unit where more than one unit is plausible, Rule 1 declares the two responses inequivalent.

The two candidates give numerical values.

Candidate 1: 0.000544  
Candidate 2: 1/1837 ≈ 0.000544372

Expressing both to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 0.000544000  
• Candidate 2 → 0.000544372

They differ starting at the fourth significant digit (0 vs 3). According to Rule 4, the numbers must match to 6 significant digits to be considered equivalent. They do not, so the answers are inequivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers express numerical values:

Candidate 1: 0.000544  
Candidate 2: 1 ⁄ 1837 ≈ 0.000544351

Written with six significant digits:

Candidate 1 → 0.000544000  
Candidate 2 → 0.000544351

They differ starting at the fourth significant digit (…40000 vs …4351).  
Since Rule 4 requires agreement to six significant digits for equivalence, the two values are not the same.

Both candidates give a negative response to the yes/no question “Does aliasing occur?”  
• Candidate 1: “False” – i.e., the statement “aliasing occurs” is false → No aliasing.  
• Candidate 2: “No” – explicitly states no aliasing.

Thus the two answers convey the same meaning and are equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical predictions:

Candidate 1: 0.5167  
Candidate 2: 0.516

Expressed to six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 0.516700  
Candidate 2 → 0.516000

Since they differ starting at the fourth decimal place, they do NOT match to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The value given by Candidate 1 is 0.322000 (to six significant digits it is 0.322000).  
The expression of Candidate 2 evaluates numerically to about 0.322397.  

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 0.322000  
• Candidate 2: 0.322397  

Since they differ at the fourth decimal place, the two answers do not match to six significant digits. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 0.322 (which, to 6 significant digits, is 0.322000).
Candidate 2 gives (√2 / 2) e^{−π/4} ≈ 0.322571.

Comparing the two numbers to 6 significant digits:
0.322000 ≠ 0.322571.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers are numerical values:

Candidate 2: (√2 / 2) e^(−π/4) ≈ 0.322047

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 0.322000  
• Candidate 2 → 0.322047

Since they differ in the fifth and sixth significant digits, they are not equal to six significant digits (Rule 4). Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates each give a single numerical answer.

Candidate 1: 1  
Candidate 2: 1.000

Both represent the same real number (1).  
According to Rule 4, we compare up to 6 significant digits: 1.00000… = 1.00000…, so they match exactly. No unit issues arise, and the question requires only one root value, which both provide.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same numerical value:  

• Candidate 1: 1 → expressed to six significant digits: 1.00000  
• Candidate 2: 1.000 → expressed to six significant digits: 1.00000  

They match exactly, hence the two predictions are equivalent.

Both answers are numerical values for the same single quantity (the approximated integral).  
Expressed to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.570796 → 1.57080  
• Candidate 2: 1.5708   → 1.57080

The two results match exactly to 6 significant digits, so they are equivalent.  

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers are single real numbers in the same implicit unit.  
Express each value to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.570796 → 1.57080 (rounded)  
• Candidate 2: 1.5708   → 1.57080 (trailing zero fills the 6th digit)

The two 6-digit values are identical (1.57080), so the candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
0.42857 (interpreted to six significant digits as 0.428570) differs from 3/7 (which is 0.428571 to six significant digits). Since the values do not match to six significant digits, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single time value.  
• Candidate 1 gives 7142 (no unit stated).  
• Candidate 2 gives 7093 s (seconds).

Assuming seconds (the usual unit in such problems), the two numerical values differ: 7142 ≠ 7093. They do not match to six significant digits (or even to three). Furthermore, Candidate 1’s omission of a unit introduces ambiguity, while Candidate 2 specifies seconds.

Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives 7142 (no unit specified; presumably seconds).  
Candidate 2 gives 7092 s.

Numerically, 7142 ≠ 7092; the values differ by 50. Hence they are not equal up to 6 significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question expects a single numerical probability value.  
Candidate 1 gives 0.01234567, while Candidate 2 gives 0.004.  
Comparing the two real numbers to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 0.0123457 (rounded to 7 dec places already provides 6 significant digits 0.0123457)  
• Candidate 2: 0.00400000  

These values are clearly different. Therefore, the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different numeric probabilities:

• Candidate 1: 0.01234567  
• Candidate 2: 0.004

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4), 0.01234567 ≠ 0.00400000.  
Thus, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the probability as 0.01234567.  
Candidate 2 gives the probability as 0.004 (i.e., 0.00400000).

These are two different real numbers; they do not match to six significant digits (or at all). Therefore, according to Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

The question explicitly asks for the Fermi temperature “in eV.”  

• Candidate 2 supplies “7.0 eV,” clearly giving the requested unit.  

• Candidate 1 supplies “81600.0” with no unit.  
  – If interpreted as eV, it is 81 600 eV, far from 7 eV.  
  – If interpreted as kelvin, it would correspond to ≈7 eV, but the question did not ask for kelvin and the omission of any unit leaves the answer ambiguous.

Because Candidate 1 omits a unit and thus creates ambiguity about the quantity being reported, Rule 1 says the two answers must be considered inequivalent.

Both candidates express the same numerical value for the forward rate; one is given in decimal form (0.070095) and the other in percentage form (7.0095 %). Converting 0.070095 to a percentage gives 7.0095 %, so the two answers are identical in value. Hence, the predictions are equivalent. 

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives 0.070095 (a decimal fraction = 7.0095 %), while Candidate 2 gives 7.01 % (a decimal fraction = 0.0701).

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.0700950  
• Candidate 2: 0.0701000  

The digits differ beginning with the 3rd significant digit (…00950 vs …01000), so they do not match to 6 significant digits. Hence, according to Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates address the yes/no question “Is there any difference … ?”

• Candidate 2 explicitly states: “There is no significant difference …” (answer = No).

• Candidate 1 answers “False,” which, in the context of a yes/no question, negates the proposition that a difference exists—i.e., it also means “No.”

Thus both convey the same conclusion: no significant difference between the medicines at the 5 % level.

The two candidates give the same numerical value (1 × 10⁻²⁴), but:

• Candidate 2 explicitly states the required unit “kg m/s”.  
• Candidate 1 omits the unit entirely.

Because the problem explicitly asks for a value “in kg m/s”, the absence of units in Candidate 1 introduces ambiguity. Under Rule 1, when a required unit is omitted and this can cause confusion, the answers are considered not equivalent.

The answers are single numerical values, so Rule 4 applies: compare both numbers to 6 significant digits.

Candidate 1: 0.7929 → 0.792900 (padded to six significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 0.79289 → 0.792890 (padded to six significant digits)

Comparing digit-by-digit:  
0.792900 ≠ 0.792890 (they differ at the 4th significant digit: 9 vs 8).

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both answers are single numerical values in the same implicit unit (m/s).  
Comparing the numbers to six significant digits:

Candidate 1: 1 750.00  
Candidate 2: 1 836.00  

They differ already in the first three digits, so they are not equal to six-digit precision (or any precision).

The question requests one numerical value (mean molecular speed) in m/s.  
Candidate 1 gives 1750.0 (implicitly m/s).  
Candidate 2 gives 1926 m/s.

Comparing the numbers to 6 significant digits:
• 1750.0  → 1.75000 × 10³  
• 1926    → 1.92600 × 10³  

They are different. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 2.843 (which equals 2.843000… when written with six significant digits).  

Candidate 2 gives an exact symbolic expression  
(π/4) [2√5 − √2 + ln((2+√5)/(1+√2))].  
Evaluating this expression numerically yields approximately 2.843285 (to six significant digits: 2.84328).

Comparing the two numbers at six‐significant‐digit precision (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 2.84300  
• Candidate 2: 2.84328  

Since these differ at the 5th–6th significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Reasoning:

• Candidate 1 gives a numerical value 2.843 (which is exactly 2.84300… to six significant digits).  
• Candidate 2 gives the exact expression  
  (π/2)·( √5 − √2/2 + ½ ln[(2+√5)/(1+√2)] ).  
  Evaluating this expression to six significant digits yields ≈ 2.84333.

• Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:  
  2.84300 ≠ 2.84333 (they differ starting at the 5th significant digit).

Therefore, by Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.
We evaluate Candidate 2 numerically:

1.  √5 ≈ 2.236067977,  √2 ≈ 1.414213562.  
   2√5 − √2 ≈ 3.057922393.

2.  (2+√5)/(1+√2) ≈ 1.7546367.  
   ln(1.7546367) ≈ 0.561479.

3.  Inside parentheses: 3.057922393 + 0.561479 ≈ 3.619401393.

4.  Multiply by π/4 (≈ 0.785398163):  
   Area ≈ 0.785398163 × 3.619401393 ≈ 2.842671  (six-digit value: 2.84267).

Candidate 1 supplies 2.843, which to six significant digits is 2.84300.

Comparing 2.84267 (Candidate 2) with 2.84300 (Candidate 1), the values differ at the fourth significant digit. According to Rule 4, they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: −64.620000 (to 6 significant digits)
Candidate 2: −64.622000 (−12√29 ≈ −64.621977…, rounded to 6 significant digits)

Since the two results do not match to 6 significant digits, they are not equivalent.

The two answers are both single numerical values, so Rule 4 applies.

• Candidate 1: 1.67 → written with six significant digits it is 1.670000  
• Candidate 2: 5/3 = 1.666666… → to six significant digits it is 1.666670

Comparing 1.670000 and 1.666670, they differ beginning at the third decimal place, so they are not identical to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers are numerical.

Candidate 1: 1.67 → expressed to six significant digits: 1.67000  
Candidate 2: 5/3 = 1.666666… → to six significant digits: 1.66667

1.67000 ≠ 1.66667, so the answers are not the same to six significant digits.

The question explicitly asks for the photon energy “in eV.”  
• Candidate 2 supplies a value with the unit “eV.”

Numerical comparison (Rule 4):  
Candidate 1 = 3448.1  
Expressed to 6 significant digits → 3448.10  
Candidate 2 = 3448.10

The question asks for the eigen values of a 3 × 3 matrix, so three values (counting multiplicity) are expected.

• Candidate 1 lists only two numbers: [2, 6].  
• Candidate 2 lists three numbers: 2, 2, 6 (with the eigenvalue 2 appearing twice).

Because the quantity and multiplicity of eigenvalues differ, the two answers are not identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for the eigen-values of a 3 × 3 matrix, so three values (counting multiplicities) are expected.

Candidate 1 supplies only two numbers: [2, 6].  
Candidate 2 supplies three numbers: 2, 2, 6 (including a repeated eigen-value).

Because the lists differ in multiplicity and length, they are not the same answer (Rule 3).

The problem asks for a single numerical value y(2).  
Both candidates give a single dimensionless number, so Rule 1 is satisfied.  
There is only one required answer, so Rule 2 and Rule 3 do not pose issues.

Now compare the numerical values to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: “3.464”  →  expressed to 6 significant digits = 3.46400  
• Candidate 2: “2√3”    →  2 × 1.732050807… = 3.4641016… → 6 significant digits = 3.46410

3.46400 ≠ 3.46410 at the 5-th and 6-th significant digits.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give single numerical answers in the same unit (dollars).  
Comparing the two numbers to 6 significant digits:

• 36983.35 → 3.698335 × 10⁴ → 36983.4 (6 significant digits)  
• 36983.39 → 3.698339 × 10⁴ → 36983.4 (6 significant digits)

The rounded values are identical, so according to Rule 4 the answers are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers represent the same numerical value when compared to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 36 983.35 → 36 983.4 (6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 36 983.44 → 36 983.4 (6 significant digits)

The slight difference (0.09) is below the threshold, so by Rule 4 the two predictions are equivalent. Units are implicitly dollars in both cases, satisfying Rule 1.

Candidate 1 lists one path: [2, 8, 10].

Candidate 2 lists two paths: [2, 6, 10] and [2, 8, 10].

The problem asks for “the shortest path” (singular). Candidate 1 supplies a single path, while Candidate 2 supplies two paths. Because the number of answers differs from what is requested and from each other, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question asks for “possible values” of g(2023); that implies a list of two numbers.  
Both candidates give two numbers, but we must check if those numbers are identical.

Candidate 1: 0.6667 and –0.6667  
Candidate 2: 2/3 (= 0.666666…, six-digit 0.666667) and –2/3 (–0.666667)

Comparing each corresponding value to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• 0.6667 → 0.666700  
• 2/3   → 0.666667  
These differ at the 5th/6th significant digit, so they are not equal to six significant digits.  
The same mismatch occurs for the negative values.

Therefore, the sets of numbers are not identical, so the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for possible values of g(2023) (two values).

Both candidates list two numbers.  
Candidate 1: 0.6667 and –0.6667  
Candidate 2: 2/3 and –2/3  (i.e., 0.666666… and –0.666666…)

Rule 4 requires equality to at least 6 significant digits.  
• 0.6667 expressed to 6 significant digits is 0.666700  
• 2/3 expressed to 6 significant digits is 0.666667  

0.666700 ≠ 0.666667, so the positive values differ; likewise for the negative values. Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for the force on q₃, which implies both magnitude and direction are required (a vector quantity).

Candidate 1: “53.94”  
• No unit stated.  
• No direction given.

Candidate 2: “54 N directed to the right”  
• Gives magnitude (≈54 N), appropriate unit (N), and direction (“to the right”).

Because Candidate 1 omits the direction (and even the unit), while Candidate 2 supplies both, the two answers are not equivalent under Rules 1, 2, and 6.

Convert each to 6 significant digits:

Since 0.170500 ≠ 0.170513 at six significant digits, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question requests a single numerical answer (flow speed) in m/s.

Candidate 1: 7.6   (unit unstated, but the problem explicitly specifies m/s, so we can interpret this as 7.6 m/s)
Candidate 2: 7.56 m/s

Treating both as m/s, we compare their numerical values to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 → 7.60000  
• Candidate 2 → 7.56000  

They differ at the second decimal place, so the two answers are not identical to 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.
