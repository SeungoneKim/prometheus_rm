The question asks for a single element of the Grothendieck-Witt ring \(\GW(\mathbb{F}_q)\).

• Candidate 1 gives \(\dfrac12\binom{2j}{j}\,(1+u)\).

• Candidate 2 gives just \(j\).

Interpreting both inside \(\GW(\mathbb{F}_q)=\mathbb{Z}\oplus\mathbb{Z}/2\):
 – Candidate 1 has rank \(\binom{2j}{j}\) (since \((1+u)\) has rank 2) and a non-trivial \(u\)-component.
 – Candidate 2 has rank \(j\) and no \(u\)-component.

Unless \(j=0\) (in which case the question degenerates to the trivial situation), these two elements are different in both rank and discriminant component. The problem statement treats \(j\) as an arbitrary non-negative integer, so the answers must agree for all \(j\). They do not.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
Both candidates agree on the density for the case γ ∈ (0,1].

For γ > 1 they differ:

• Candidate 1: puts weight 1 − 1/γ at 0 and uses the density f_{1/γ}(x) (i.e. the Marčenko–Pastur density with parameter 1/γ).  
  → Support becomes [(1 − 1/√γ)², (1 + 1/√γ)²], which is not the true support for parameter γ.

• Candidate 2: puts weight 1 − 1/γ at 0 and says the “same density” as before, i.e. f_γ(x) with support [(√γ − 1)², (√γ + 1)²].  
  → This is the correct description.

Thus the two answers give different continuous parts (different support and different formula) when γ > 1, so the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas for the same single quantity.

• Candidate 1: explicit closed‐form formula ⌊n²/4⌋ + 1.  
• Candidate 2: recurrence a(n)=a(n−1)+a(n−2)+a(n−3) with a(1)=1, a(2)=2, a(3)=3.

Evaluating both at n=4:  
– Candidate 1 ⇒ ⌊16/4⌋+1 = 4+1 = 5.  
– Candidate 2 ⇒ 3+2+1 = 6.

Since they yield different values, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the closed-form formula ⌊n²/4⌋ + 1.  
Candidate 2 claims the answer follows the Fibonacci numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …) or a similar sequence, explicitly stating uncertainty and giving early terms 1, 2, 3, 6,… .

These two proposed sequences/formulas are clearly different and cannot be converted into each other. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give closed-form counts, but their formulas are different.

• Candidate 1’s denominator is the product of factorials of the numbers of vertices of each out-degree:  d₀! d₁! d₂! …

• Candidate 2’s denominator is the product of factorials of the out-degrees themselves, each raised to the power dᵢ:  ∏_{i≥0}(i!)^{dᵢ}.

These two denominators are not generally equal.  
For a valid tree with d₀ = 1, d₁ = 2 (a path of length 3, so n = 3),

 Candidate 1 gives (3 − 1)! / (1! · 2!) = 2/2 = 1,  
 Candidate 2 gives (3 − 1)! / [(0!)¹(1!)²] = 2/1 = 2.

Hence the two candidates yield different counts, so they are not equivalent.

The question requests three separate formulas for q, each expressed in terms of n, i, k (and in part 3, distinguishing odd versus even k).

Candidate 1 supplies:

1. q = k^{n+2-i}  
2. q = k^{n+1-i}  
3. q = k^{n+2-i} (odd k) or ½ k^{n+2-i} (even k)

Candidate 2 supplies:

1. q = k  
2. q = k^{i}  
3. q = k^{i} (odd k) or 0 (even k)

The two sets of formulas are plainly different for every case (different powers of k, different dependence on n and i, different even/odd cases). Therefore, per Rule 2 (all sub-answers must agree) and Rule 6 (mathematical mismatch), the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give fundamentally different sets of palindromes.

• Candidate 1 supplies a finite explicit list: {1, 2, 3, 22, 212, 232, 12321, 32123}.  
• Candidate 2 claims the complete set consists of all palindromes made entirely of 1’s except for a single central 2, of length 2ⁿ − 1 (n ≥ 1); this is an infinite family and, for example, includes “121” but never “22”, “3”, “232”, etc.

Because the two answers describe different collections (they disagree on which palindromes can appear), they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the value 4 / (3 π) ≈ 0.424413  
Candidate 2 gives the value 7 / 15 ≈ 0.466667  

Comparing to six significant digits:  
0.424413 ≠ 0.466667

  (essentially an expression growing like n·2^{n})

• Candidate 2: |DPCₙ| = Catalanₙ = (1/(n+1))·C(2n,n)  
  (grows asymptotically like 4^{n}/n^{3/2})

These have entirely different functional forms and cannot be algebraically equivalent. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a single piece-wise formula  
aw = 4 when (n is even AND diameter is odd),  
aw = 3 otherwise.

Candidate 2 lists two different, mutually inconsistent formulas:
• “answer 1”: aw = 2 if n even, 3 if n odd.  
• “answer 2”: aw = 2 if diameter even, 3 if diameter odd.

Thus Candidate 2 does not match Candidate 1 for any general setting; even for the case (n even & diameter odd) Candidate 1 says 4 while Candidate 2’s two lines would give 2 and 3 respectively. The answers are clearly different, and Candidate 2 even contains conflicting statements within itself.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different formulae for both parts of the representation.

• Homogeneous part  
  – C1: Σ_{j=0}^{n₀−1} e_j v_j(t) (upper index n₀−1).  
  – C2: Σ_{j=0}^{m} c_j v_j(t) (upper index m).  
  Because n₀ (depending on Re β₀) need not equal m (number of σ_i), the sums are generally over different numbers of canonical solutions.

• Particular part  
  – C1: an explicit Neumann-series-type expression: V_h(t)=Σ_{k=0}^{∞} (-1)^k I_{α,β₀,ω}^{θ₀} ( Σ_{i=1}^{m} σ_i(t) I_{α,β₀−β_i,ω}^{θ₀−θ_i} )^{k} g(t).  
  – C2: a simple single-operator form V_h(t)= I_{α,β,ω}^{θ} h(t).  
  These are not the same operator expression.

Since both the homogeneous and the particular parts differ, the two answers are not equivalent under the rules.

The question requires one piecewise expression with two cases:  
1) when a = d and b = c,  
2) otherwise.

Candidate 1 provides exactly that, giving  
• a non-zero formula (involving (–1)^b and factorials) for the first case,  
• 0 for the second case.

Candidate 2 lists “*answer 1: 0” and “*answer 2: (2π²/(2a+2b+1))((a+b)!/(a! b!))²”, but never states which answer corresponds to which condition, nor does it match Candidate 1’s non-zero formula (it contains π² and no (–1)^b factor). The two expressions differ structurally and numerically.

Hence the two candidates are not giving the same results for any of the cases.

The two candidates give the same quantity.

Candidate 1:
[z^{n}](φ(z))^{k} = (k/n) [z^{n-1}]( z^{k-1} R(z)^{n} ).

Because z^{k-1} is just a monomial factor,  
[z^{n-1}]( z^{k-1} R(z)^{n} ) = [z^{\,n-1-(k-1)}] R(z)^{n} = [z^{\,n-k}] R(z)^{n}.

Candidate 2 already writes the result as (k/n) [w^{n-k}] R(w)^{n}.

Thus both candidates give (k/n) · coefficient of z^{n-k} in R(z)^{n}. They are equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions for the derivative:

\[
\frac{n-\mathbf{p}+1}{q}\int_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}} h_L^{\,q}(\xi)\,h_K^{\,1-q}(\xi)\,d\mu_K(\xi).
\]

• Candidate 2:  
\[
\int_{\partial K} h_L^{\,q}\,h_K^{\,\mathbf{p}-1}\,d\mu_K.
\]

Differences:

1. Prefactor: Candidate 1 has \((n-\mathbf{p}+1)/q\); Candidate 2 has none.
2. Power of \(h_K\): Candidate 1 uses \(h_K^{\,1-q}\); Candidate 2 uses \(h_K^{\,\mathbf{p}-1}\).
3. Domain of integration: sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\) vs boundary \(\partial K\).
4. Possible mismatch of the measure’s definition in each integral.

Because the integrals and factors do not match, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different groups in several sub-cases.

• For case (ii) with even d, Candidate 1 gives S_{(d/2+1)} wr ℤ₂ (order 2·((d/2+1)!)²), whereas Candidate 2 gives the dihedral group D_{d+2} (order 2(d+2)). These are not isomorphic for general d.

• For case (ii) with odd d, Candidate 1 gives S_{⌈n/2⌉} × S_{⌊n/2⌋}, while Candidate 2 says the group is trivial.

• For case (iii) with odd d, Candidate 1 gives ℤ₂ × ℤ₂, while Candidate 2 again says the group is trivial.

Since there are discrepancies in multiple required sub-cases, the two predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: “f(x,y) = 0”.  
• Candidate 2: “0” (implicitly the same statement that the function equals zero).

There is only one required answer, and both give the same value with no unit or type discrepancy. Hence the answers are equivalent.

Both answers supply values for all six requested parameters (v, k, λ₁, λ₂, m, n), so we compare each component.  
The expressions in Candidate 1 (fractions and high-degree polynomials in q) are completely different from the much simpler monomials given in Candidate 2. None of the corresponding components match algebraically or numerically. Therefore the two sets of parameters are not the same.

The two expressions are plainly different mathematical objects.

• Candidate 1 is a q-Pochhammer symbol
 (−q^r ; ε q^{r+t+s})_∞ = ∏_{k=0}^{∞} (1 + ε^{k} q^{r + k(r+t+s)}).

• Candidate 2 is the infinite product
 ∏_{n=1}^{∞} (1 − q^{n} + ε q^{s+n}).

Even for particular choices of the parameters (e.g. r = 1, t = 0, s = 0, ε = 1) they give completely different results (Candidate 1 becomes ∏_{k=0}^{∞}(1+q^{1+k}), whereas Candidate 2 collapses to 1). Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give explicit but entirely different formulas for both \(\gamma^{all}_{0,\min}\) and \(\gamma^{all}_{0,\max}\).

• Candidate 1:
\[
\gamma^{all}_{0,\min}=\frac{k+s}{(s+1)k}+\frac{s^{2}(k+r)}{(r-1)(s+1)k},\qquad
\gamma^{all}_{0,\max}=\gamma^{all}_{0,\min}+\frac{r-1}{4k(k+r)(s+1)}.
\]

• Candidate 2:
\[
\gamma^{all}_{0,\min}=\frac{k-s+1}{k},\qquad
\gamma^{all}_{0,\max}=\frac{k+r-s+1}{k}.
\]

The expressions differ in structure, denominators, and dependence on the parameters \(s\) and \(r\). They cannot be algebraically equal for all \(k,s,r\). Hence, under Rule 2/Rule 8 the answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: c² / (σ₁² + σ₂²)

A logarithmic function and a rational algebraic function are not generally equal; there is no algebraic identity that makes these two expressions coincide for arbitrary σ₁², σ₂², and c (except possibly in special limiting cases, which is not sufficient for overall equivalence).

Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

 ⇒ value = a^{4}.

• Candidate 2:  
(1/(1+1))·(a^{3}+a^{4}) = (a^{3}+a^{4})/2.

Because a^{4} ≠ (a^{3}+a^{4})/2 for general a, the two expressions are unequal (except in degenerate cases such as t = 0). Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two formulas are structurally very different.

Candidate 1  
 ∑_{i=1}^{m-1} (1 − ρ_i(g)) / (1 − μ̂(ρ_i))

• excludes the trivial character (i = 0);  
• numerator is (1 − ρ_i(g));  
• no overall factor of 1/m.

Candidate 2  
 (1/m) ∑_{i=0}^{m-1} ρ_i(g) / (1 − μ̂(ρ_i))

• includes the i = 0 term (where the denominator 1 − μ̂(ρ_0)=0, making the term undefined);  
• numerator is ρ_i(g) (no “1 −”);  
• multiplies by an overall factor 1/m.

Because of these differences the two expressions cannot coincide in general (indeed the i=0 term in Candidate 2 is singular). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not equivalent.

Reasoning:
• Candidate 1’s formula depends only on q and r: ½ · C(2q, r).
• Candidate 2’s formula depends on K as well as q and r: C(K, r) – C(K – q, r).

Since the value of Candidate 2 changes when K changes (for fixed q and r) while Candidate 1 is completely independent of K, the two cannot be identical for arbitrary K. An identity that is independent of K on one side and dependent on K on the other side cannot hold for all possible K. Therefore the predictions are different.

The question asks for a single numerical‐valued expression (in terms of \(q\)-binomial coefficients) giving the maximum cardinality.  
• Candidate 1 gives a sum over many \(q\)-binomial terms indexed by \(\ell\) satisfying a congruence condition.  
• Candidate 2 gives the single \(q\)-binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{t}_{q}\).

These two expressions are clearly different functions of \(n\), \(t\), and \(q\) (e.g., for \(t=1\) they evaluate to \(\sum_{k}\binom{n}{2k}_{q}\) versus \(\binom{n}{1}_{q}\)), so they cannot be equivalent answers to the same question.

The two answers give different algebraic expressions:

Candidate 1: C₁ = (1 − 1/N)  / (1 − 1/N^{K/D})

Candidate 2: C₂ = K / (N D) = (K/D)/N

In general, these are not the same function of N, K, D. For example, taking K = 2D (so K/D = 2) and any N ≥ 2,

C₁ = (N − 1)/(1 − N^{−2}) = N²/(N+1) while C₂ = 2/N.

Since N²/(N+1) ≠ 2/N (e.g., for N = 2: 4/3 ≠ 1), the two expressions are not equal. Therefore the predictions are inequivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions give different numerical values in general.  
Example: for n = 1  
• Candidate 1: ⌈2√1⌉ = ⌈2⌉ = 2  
• Candidate 2: ⌈(1+√(1+12·1))/2⌉ = ⌈(1+√13)/2⌉ ≈ ⌈2.30278⌉ = 3  

Because the ceilings differ already at n = 1, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

Candidate 1: ⌈2√n⌉  
Candidate 2: ⌈1 + 2√n⌉ = ⌈2√n⌉ + 1  (since adding an integer inside the ceiling shifts the ceiling up by exactly 1)

Hence Candidate 2 is always exactly one larger than Candidate 1 for every positive integer n.  
They are therefore not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: \(k = \bigl\lceil\log_{p}(1/\xi)\bigr\rceil\).

These functions of \(\xi\) and \(p\) are plainly not algebraically equal (Candidate 1 grows astronomically faster than Candidate 2). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates describe the same object.

• Candidate 1 gives the standard minimax formula  
  val(ini) = sup_σ inf_τ E^{σ,τ}_ini = inf_τ sup_σ E^{σ,τ}_ini,  
which is exactly the expected payoff when each player uses an optimal strategy.

• Candidate 2 states in words that val(ini) is “the expected payoff when both players employ their optimal strategies, starting from the initial distribution ini.”

The verbal description in Candidate 2 conveys the same concept as the formal minimax expression in Candidate 1. No additional distinct pieces of information are required, and there is no contradiction between the two.

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same closed-form expression

for p≠0.  

Candidate 2 additionally states the limiting value at p=0,
 I(0)= –π²/12,  
which is exactly the limit of Candidate 1’s formula as p→0.  
Thus Candidate 1’s answer (interpreted with that limit, as the problem requests) and Candidate 2’s answer describe the same function.

• Candidate 2: Γ(s) G_{1,2}^{1,1}\!\left(a\;\Big|\begin{smallmatrix}1\\0,\,1-s\end{smallmatrix}\right)

They have different orders of the Meijer G function, different parameter lists, different arguments (a versus a²/4), and different prefactors (1/4π^{3/2} versus Γ(s)). There is no evident transformation that makes these expressions identical.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

4. An overall prefactor 1/(4 π^{3/2}) present only in Candidate 1.

Such markedly different Meijer-G forms (with different parameters and scaling) cannot be identical without additional identities, and none are indicated. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single real‐number result for the double integral.

Candidate 1: π ≈ 3.14159 …

Candidate 2: π [erf(eᵉ)]².  
For x = eᵉ ≈ 15.1543, erf(x)=1−O(e^{−x²}).  Since e^{−(eᵉ)²}=e^{−229.65…}≈1.9 × 10^{−100},  
erf(eᵉ)=0.99999 … 9 (the first 99 decimal places are 9’s).  
Thus [erf(eᵉ)]² differs from 1 only at the ~10^{−100} level, so

π [erf(eᵉ)]² = π (1 ± 10^{−100}) = 3.14159 … with agreement to far more than 6 significant digits.

According to Rule 4, two numerical answers are considered the same if they coincide to 6 significant digits.  
π and π [erf(eᵉ)]² coincide to many more than 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates set their left‐hand side equal to π/2; the only possible difference is in how the left‐hand side is written.

Recall the trigonometric identity  
sin(arccos θ) = √(1 – θ²).

Take θ = 1 – c.

Then  
sin(arccos(1 – c)) = √(1 – (1 – c)²) = √(1 – (1 – 2c + c²)) = √(2c – c²).

Candidate 1 left side:  
(1 – c)(π – arccos(1 – c)) + sin(arccos(1 – c))

⇨ (1 – c)(π – arccos(1 – c)) + √(2c – c²),

which is exactly Candidate 2 left side:  
√(2c – c²) + (π – arccos(1 – c))(1 – c).

Thus the two equations are algebraically identical.

Both answers state that the limit is the (single) real number that satisfies the fixed-point equation cos(z) = z. Candidate 1 calls it α and also supplies an approximate decimal value; Candidate 2 calls it c and omits the approximation. Because both refer to the exact same uniquely defined real constant, the two predictions are mathematically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates both state that the limit equals the unique fixed‐point of the cosine function.

• Candidate 1: “α is the unique real solution of cos α = α (approximately 0.739085).”  
• Candidate 2: “0.7390851332151607”.

Comparing their numerical values to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
– Candidate 1: 0.739085  
– Candidate 2: 0.7390851332151607 → 0.739085 (first 6 significant digits).

They match. Candidate 1’s additional descriptive wording does not change the result. Hence the answers are equivalent.

• ln(2 + √3) ≈ ln(3.7320508) ≈ 1.316957  
  ⇒ Candidate 1 ≈ π × 1.316957 / 6 ≈ 3.141593 × 1.316957 / 6 ≈ 0.689040

• ln 2 ≈ 0.693147  
  ⇒ Candidate 2 ≈ π × 0.693147 / 4 ≈ 3.141593 × 0.693147 / 4 ≈ 0.544395

0.689040 ≠ 0.544395 (they differ already in the first three significant figures), so the two answers are numerically different. By Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1:  (ln² a − ln² b) / [2 (a − b)]
  = [(ln a − ln b)(ln a + ln b)] / [2 (a − b)]
  = [ln(a/b) · ln(ab)] / [2 (a − b)].

Candidate 2:  ln(b/a) / (a − b)
  = −ln(a/b) / (a − b).

Thus
 Candidate 1 = (−½ ln (ab)) · Candidate 2.

Since −½ ln (ab) is generally not the constant 1 (it depends on a and b), the two answers differ for almost all positive distinct a, b. Hence they are not equivalent.

Both expressions can be rewritten to show they match:

Candidate 1  
V = (16 π / 3)(1 − 1/√2)  
  = (16 π / 3) · (√2 − 1)/√2  
  = (16/√2)(π/3)(√2 − 1)  
  = (8√2)(π/3)(√2 − 1)  
  = (8π / 3)(2 − √2).

Candidate 2 is already (8 π / 3)(2 − √2).

Since they are exactly the same algebraic expression (and thus the same numerical value and unit), the two candidates are equivalent.

The problem has two sub-questions (one value for the integral and one for the double sum).  
• Candidate 1 supplies only a single number “\( \tfrac{5\pi^{2}}{12} \)”, giving just one answer.  
• Candidate 2 supplies two answers, explicitly labeling them “answer 1” and “answer 2”, each equal to \( \tfrac{5\pi^{2}}{12} \).

Since Candidate 1 gives fewer answers than required, while Candidate 2 gives two answers, the responses are not equivalent according to Rule 2.

The two candidates give different functional forms:

• Candidate 1: \(e^{-az}\,H_0^{(1)}(z)=e^{-az}\,[J_0(z)+iY_0(z)]\)

• Candidate 2: \(\pi\,e^{az}\,J_0(z)\)

They differ in

1. An overall factor ( \(e^{-az}\) vs \( \pi e^{az}\) ).
2. Presence of the Neumann–Bessel part \(iY_0(z)\) in Candidate 1, absent in Candidate 2.

Since these expressions are not the same (even up to a constant factor) for general positive \(a,z\), the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give

1. e^{-az} H₀^{(1)}(z)

2. π e^{-az} J₀(z)

After the common factor e^{-az} is factored out, they differ by the special-function factor:

• H₀^{(1)}(z) = J₀(z) + i Y₀(z)  (Hankel function of the first kind)

• π J₀(z) is simply π times the Bessel J function and has no Y₀ component.

Because H₀^{(1)}(z) is not equal to π J₀(z) (it contains the additional imaginary Bessel Y part and no constant π factor), the two expressions are not the same.

Hence the two candidate answers are inequivalent.

Both expressions represent the same numerical value:

• Starting with Candidate 2:  

 sin(π/5) = sin 36° = √[(5 – √5)/8]  
 ⇒ 1/sin(π/5) = √[8/(5 – √5)]

 So Candidate 2 = 5π · √[8/(5 – √5)] = 10√2 π / √(5 – √5).

• Candidate 1 is π·√[10(√5 + 5)] = π √10 √(√5 + 5).

Square both sides (without π):

 L² = 10(√5 + 5)  
 R² = (10√2 / √(5 – √5))² = 200/(5 – √5)

But (√5 + 5)(5 – √5) = 20, so  

 10(√5 + 5)(5 – √5) = 10·20 = 200 ⇒ L² = R².

Hence the two candidates are exactly equal.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different closed-form expressions:

 (depends on m through the Gamma arguments and is non-zero for general m)

• Candidate 2:  K(z,m)=2^{z} √π  Γ(z+½)/Γ(½−z) · 2π δ_{m,0}  
 (non-zero only when m=0 because of the δ_{m,0} factor and has a completely different Gamma structure)

The two formulas differ in their dependence on m, in their overall multiplicative factors, and they do not agree even for m=0 (numeric check shows different values). Hence they are not equivalent.

The two candidates both give the value  
ln 3 − ¼ (Candidate 2 writes it explicitly, Candidate 1 writes log 3 − ¼, where “log” in pure-mathematics notation ordinarily denotes the natural logarithm).  
Since both expressions represent the same real number, the answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same algebraic expression except for the logarithm notation:

• Candidate 1:  log(3) − 1/4  
• Candidate 2:  ln(3) − 1/4  

In standard mathematical usage (especially in calculus and analysis, the context of this problem), “log” without an explicit base denotes the natural logarithm, the same function written as “ln.” Hence log(3) = ln(3).

Since the subtraction term −1/4 is identical in both answers, the two candidates represent the identical numerical value.

Candidate 2 gives the result  
 Γ(z) i^{\,z}.

Using the principal branch of the complex logarithm, i = e^{iπ/2}, so  
 i^{\,z} = e^{z ln i} = e^{z (iπ/2)} = e^{+iπz/2}.

Hence Γ(z) i^{\,z} = Γ(z) e^{+iπz/2}, which differs from Γ(z) e^{-iπz/2} by complex conjugation (the sign in the exponent is opposite). These expressions are not the same for general z (they coincide only for very special values of z), so the two candidates are inequivalent.

Both candidates provide a single expression for \(B(t)\).  
Candidate 1: \(B(t)=\exp\!\bigl(\int_{0}^{t} r_s\,ds\bigr)\)  
Candidate 2: \(B(t)=\exp\!\bigl(\int_{0}^{t} r_\tau\,d\tau\bigr)\)

The integration variable \(s\) versus \(\tau\) is a dummy variable, so the two formulas are mathematically identical. Hence the answers are equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

• Candidate 1: π / [α sin(π α)]

• Candidate 2: π / [α sin(π α)] − 1/α²

The second expression subtracts an extra term, 1/α², which is non-zero for every α in the interval (0, 1). Therefore the two answers cannot be the same.

The two candidates give different formulas.

1. Overall sign: Candidate 1 has an overall factor “− c”, whereas Candidate 2 has “+ c”.
2. Argument of J₀:  
   • Candidate 1:  kc √[ τ² − (R/c)² ] (square root present)  
   • Candidate 2:  kc [ τ² − (R/c)² ]  (no square root)

Because the arguments of the Bessel function differ (presence vs. absence of a square root) and the overall signs differ, the two expressions are not mathematically equivalent.

The two expressions differ only in the power of \((-1)\):

Candidate 1: \((-1)^{\,n-1}\dfrac{2}{2n-1}\)

Candidate 2: \((-1)^{\,n+1}\dfrac{2}{2n-1}\)

Since
\[
(-1)^{\,n+1}=(-1)^{\,n-1}\,(-1)^{\,2}=(-1)^{\,n-1}\times 1 = (-1)^{\,n-1},
\]
the two candidates give exactly the same value for every integer \(n\).

The value of cos⁻¹(2/3) ≈ 0.8410686736 radians.  
Converting this to degrees: 0.8410686736 rad × (180 / π) ≈ 48.189685°.

Candidate 1 gives 48.189685°, which matches the degree equivalent of Candidate 2’s expression.  
After unit conversion, the two answers are identical to at least six significant digits.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 1.4907.  
Candidate 2 gives the exact expression \(\dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{3}\).

Numerically,
\(\dfrac{2\sqrt{5}}{3} \approx 1.490712\).

Expressing both answers to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 1.490700  
• Candidate 2: 1.490712  

They differ at the 6th significant digit (…700 vs …712).  
According to Rule 4, the two answers must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent; they do not.

The two candidates give the same numerical information, just expressed through the reciprocal quantities “period” and “frequency.”

• Candidate 1: 0.7854 s  → frequency = 1 / 0.7854 s ≈ 1.273236 Hz  
• Candidate 2: 4/π Hz ≈ 1.273240 Hz  

After converting one to the same physical quantity as the other (using f = 1/T), the two values agree to at least six significant digits (1.27323 Hz). Hence the predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical times:

• Candidate 1: 0.2244 s → 0.224400 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: π/14 s ≈ 0.224399 s → 0.224399 (to six significant digits)

Comparing the six significant digits, 0.224400 differs from 0.224399 at the 4th–6th digits. Therefore they do not match to six significant digits and are not equivalent.

The answers are numerical dollar amounts.

Candidate 1: 3930 $  
Candidate 2: 3929.68 $

Expressing both with six significant digits and the same exponent:

Candidate 1 → 3.93000 × 10³  
Candidate 2 → 3.92968 × 10³

They differ at the third significant digit (3.93000 vs 3.92968), so they do NOT match to six significant digits.

Both candidates give a single time value, but in different units.

• Convert Candidate 1 to minutes:
7.136 h × 60 min/h = 428.160 min.

• Candidate 2 already states 428.13 min.

Compare the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

428.160 vs 428.130 → they differ in the 5th significant digit (…160 vs …130).

Since the values are not identical to 6 significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reasoning:
1. Numerical comparison to 6 significant digits:
   • Candidate 1: 0.0408000  
   • Candidate 2: 0.0408163  
    
   They differ beginning at the 5th significant digit, so they are not the same value.

2. Units:
   • Candidate 1 gives no unit.  
   • Candidate 2 specifies “kg/m”.  

   The mismatch/omission of units adds further inequivalence.

Hence the answers are different.

The two candidates give the acceleration in different units:  

• Candidate 1: 83.81 m/s²  
• Candidate 2: 5.44 g  

Convert Candidate 2 to m/s²: 5.44 g ≈ 5.44 × 9.8 m/s² ≈ 53.3 m/s².  

Compare to Candidate 1’s 83.81 m/s²: the values differ significantly (83.81 ≠ 53.3).  
Or, in g-units, Candidate 1 corresponds to 83.81 / 9.8 ≈ 8.55 g, whereas Candidate 2 is 5.44 g.

Since the numerical answers are not equal, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 1.4 × 10³ kg m⁻³  = 1400 kg m⁻³.  
Candidate 2 gives 1444.444… kg m⁻³.

Comparing the numerical values to six significant digits:
• 1400 kg m⁻³  → 1.40000 × 10³  
• 1444.444 kg m⁻³ → 1.44444 × 10³  

Since 1.40000 ≠ 1.44444, the two answers are not the same.

• Candidate 2: “4.16 × 10⁴²”.

Interpreting Candidate 1 as 4.16 × 10^{42}, both answers are identical to at least six significant digits with the same exponent, giving the same dimensionless ratio.

The two answers are numerical values that should be compared to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

• Candidate 1: 3.07 × 10²¹

• Candidate 2: 3.09 × 10²¹  
  → expressed to 6 sig. digits: 3.09000 × 10²¹

Since 3.07000 × 10²¹ ≠ 3.09000 × 10²¹ at 6 significant digits, the two predictions are not the same.  
(The omitted unit in Candidate 2 does not rescue equivalence, because even after assuming the same unit, the numerical values differ.)

The two candidates differ in their treatment of units.

• Candidate 1 gives “2.7 10^6” with no unit specified.  
• Candidate 2 gives “2.7 × 10⁶ m/s,” explicitly stating the unit.

Because the question asks for a speed and speed can reasonably be expressed in various units (m/s, cm/s, km/s, etc.), omitting the unit introduces ambiguity under Rule 1. Therefore the two answers are not considered equivalent.

The question asks for “the $x$ coordinate of particle 3.”  
It requires a single numerical location (one answer).

Candidate 1 supplies one value:
• 2.72 L

Candidate 2 supplies two distinct values:
• (5 + √10)/3 L  ≈ 2.72076 L  
• (5 – √10)/3 L  ≈ 0.61257 L

Thus Candidate 2 gives an extra position that Candidate 1 does not, and the two sets of answers are not identical.  
Because the number of answers differs and at least one of Candidate 2’s values (≈0.613 L) is not present in Candidate 1, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 supplies a single location: 2.72 L.

Candidate 2 supplies two distinct locations: (5 − √10)/3 L ≈ 0.613 L and (5 + √10)/3 L ≈ 2.721 L.

Thus Candidate 2 lists an additional coordinate that Candidate 1 does not give.  
Under Rule 2, if the problem requires more than one answer and a candidate gives fewer, the answers are not equivalent; likewise, giving extra distinct answers when only one is required also makes the two responses inequivalent. Therefore the two candidates’ predictions are not the same set of answers.

• Candidate 2: “8.99 × 10^9 N”.

Interpreting the space in Candidate 1 as the usual multiplication symbol in scientific notation, both correspond to 8.99000 × 10^9 N to six significant digits. Hence they are equivalent per Rule 4 (same value) and Rule 1 (same unit).

The minor formatting difference (missing explicit “×” in Candidate 1) does not introduce ambiguity in this context; it is clearly meant as scientific notation.

The two answers are numerical values in the same unit (newtons).

Convert to the same form with 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 8.87 × 10⁻¹⁵ N → 8.87000 × 10⁻¹⁵ N  
• Candidate 2: 8.88 × 10⁻¹⁵ N → 8.88000 × 10⁻¹⁵ N  

The mantissas (8.87000 vs 8.88000) differ at the 3rd significant digit, so they are not equal to 6 significant digits.

Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

• 6.25000 × 10¹¹

The question asks for a single numerical count (number of excess electrons).

Candidate 1: “2.00 10^{10} electrons;”  
Candidate 2: “2.00 × 10¹⁰”

Interpretation:
• Candidate 1 clearly intends scientific notation; the space is a typographical omission of the “×”.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly writes the scientific-notation “×”.

Both represent 2.00 × 10¹⁰, and both refer to the same unit (a count of electrons; Candidate 2’s unit is implicit from the question and unambiguous).

Thus the two answers are numerically identical and meet the same requirement of the problem.

The two answers are expressed in the same physical units after conversion:

• Candidate 1: 12 kJ = 12 000 J  
• Candidate 2: 13 480 J

Comparing to six significant digits gives 1.20000 × 10⁴ J vs. 1.34800 × 10⁴ J, which are different. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers give values for the same physical quantity (a length) but in different units.  

• Candidate 1: 0.42 pm  = 0.42 × 10⁻¹² m = 4.20000 × 10⁻¹³ m  
• Candidate 2: 4.1998 × 10⁻¹³ m  

Expressed with six significant digits, these are 4.20000 × 10⁻¹³ m and 4.19980 × 10⁻¹³ m.  
They differ already at the second significant digit (2 vs. 1), so they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give single numerical answers for the same quantity, but in different units.

−6420 J mol⁻¹ and −1770 J mol⁻¹ differ greatly (they do not match to six significant digits). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers express the melting point in different units, but after conversion they can be compared directly:

• Candidate 1: 272.8 K → 272.800 K  
  In °C: 272.8 K − 273.15 = −0.350 °C

• Candidate 2: −0.36 °C → −0.360 °C  
  In K: −0.36 °C + 273.15 = 272.790 K

Comparing either in Celsius (−0.350000 °C vs −0.360000 °C) or Kelvin (272.800000 K vs 272.790000 K), the values differ at the fifth significant digit; therefore they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4.

Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

  226 pm = 226 × 10⁻¹² m = 2.26 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

• Candidate 2: 2.26 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

After conversion, both are 2.26 × 10⁻¹⁰ m, matching to at least six significant digits. Therefore, the answers are equivalent.

The two candidates give the same physical unit after conversion (wavenumber), but:

• Candidate 1: 82 258 cm⁻¹  = 8.2258 × 10⁶ m⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 8.23 × 10⁶ m⁻¹  (which is 8.23000 × 10⁶ m⁻¹ to six significant digits)

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

8.22580 ≠ 8.23000

Since the values do not match exactly to six significant digits, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers are both given as wavenumbers, but in different units:

• Candidate 1: 82258 cm⁻¹  
 → 82258 cm⁻¹ × (100 m⁻¹ per cm⁻¹) = 8.2258 × 10⁶ m⁻¹

• Candidate 2: 8.23 × 10⁶ m⁻¹

Expressed with six significant digits:
 Candidate 1: 8.22580 × 10⁶ m⁻¹  
 Candidate 2: 8.23000 × 10⁶ m⁻¹

Rule 4 requires the numbers to match to six significant digits.  
8.22580 ≠ 8.23000, so they do not match.

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both answers give the energy in different units, so we converted:

27 kcal mol⁻¹ → J per molecule  
27 kcal mol⁻¹ = 112 968 J mol⁻¹  
112 968 J mol⁻¹ ÷ (6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹) ≈ 1.8759 × 10⁻¹⁹ J molecule⁻¹

Candidate 2 supplies 1.874445 × 10⁻¹⁹ J.

Compare to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 in J per molecule: 1.87590×10⁻¹⁹  
• Candidate 2:               1.87445×10⁻¹⁹

Digits differ in the 4th–6th significant places, so they do NOT match to six significant digits.  
Equivalent comparison in kcal mol⁻¹ gives 27.0000 vs 26.9958—also a mismatch at the 4th significant digit.

Hence, despite being numerically very close, the candidates are not strictly equivalent under the rules.
The numeric value in Candidate 1 is “27 kcal /mol”.

Convert to joules:
27 kcal /mol × 4184 J /kcal = 1.13 × 10^5 J /mol.

For Candidate 2 we must decide whether the figure “1.874445 × 10^-19 J” is meant per molecule or per mole.  
• If we interpret it per mole, it is 1.9 × 10^-19 J /mol, which is 17 orders of magnitude smaller than Candidate 1.  
• If we interpret it per molecule and convert to per mole (multiply by Avogadro’s number), we obtain  

1.874445 × 10^-19 J × 6.022 × 10^23 mol^-1 = 1.13 × 10^5 J /mol  
→ 26.98 kcal /mol.

Thus, after conversion, Candidate 2 gives ≈ 26.98 kcal /mol, whereas Candidate 1 gives 27.000 kcal /mol.  
Comparing to six significant digits: 26.9800 vs 27.0000 differ at the third decimal place, so Rule 4 says they are not identical.

Moreover, Candidate 2 does not state “per molecule” or “per mole”, leaving the unit basis ambiguous (Rule 1).

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same dimensionless number:

• Candidate 1: “3 10^{26}” is standard shorthand for 3 × 10²⁶.  
• Candidate 2: “3.0 × 10²⁶” explicitly states 3 × 10²⁶ (with one extra significant figure, which does not alter the value to six significant digits: 3.00000 × 10²⁶).

Since they represent the identical numerical value and no units are involved, the two answers are equivalent.

0.030000 and 0.0295545 differ at the third significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different kinds of answers:

• Candidate 1 supplies a numerical probability: 0.3359 (which, padded to six significant digits, is 0.335900).

• Candidate 2 supplies a symbolic sum  
  ∑_{k=27}^{50} C(50,k)(½)^{50}.

That sum equals P{Bin(50,½) ≥ 27}.  Computing this exactly gives

 P = 0.335905…  (≈ 0.335906 to six significant digits).

Comparing the six-significant-digit forms:

 Candidate 1: 0.335900  
 Candidate 2: 0.335906

They differ in the 6th significant digit, so by Rule 4 the answers are not the same. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
0.3359 (Candidate 1) is a numerical probability, whereas Candidate 2 gives the exact binomial sum  
\[
\sum_{k=27}^{50}\binom{50}{k}\left(\frac12\right)^{50}.
\]

Evaluating that sum exactly equals  

\[
P=\frac{1-\bigl[\binom{50}{24}+\binom{50}{25}+\binom{50}{26}\bigr]2^{-50}}{2}
\approx 0.335905.
\]

Expressed to six significant digits this is 0.335905.  
Candidate 1’s value, with the implied six-digit representation 0.335900, differs in the 6th significant digit (0 vs 5).

According to Rule 4, answers that do not match to six significant digits are not equivalent.

The question either expects four separate probabilities (for Y = 0, 1, 2, 3) or the single cumulative probability P(Y ≤ 3).  
Regardless of that interpretation:

• Both candidates give only one numerical value, so if four separate answers are required, both are incomplete; however, we still compare the values they actually give.  
• Treating the responses as single numerical predictions, compare them using Rule 4 (six-significant-digit equality):

 Candidate 1: 0.998400  
 Candidate 2: 0.998200  

These differ (0.998400 ≠ 0.998200).

Express each to six significant digits:

Evaluate Candidate 2: 
1 – 1/e ≈ 1 – 0.367 879 441 171… = 0.632 120 558 829…

Candidate 1 gives 0.6321205588, which matches 1 – 1/e to at least the first 6 significant digits (0.632120).

Thus, by Rule 4, the two candidates are equivalent.

Based on Rule 4, we must compare the numerical answers to six significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 4152 K → 4.15200 × 10³ (digits: 4 1 5 2 0 0)  
• Candidate 2: 4151 K → 4.15100 × 10³ (digits: 4 1 5 1 0 0)

The fourth significant digit differs (2 vs 1), so the two answers are not identical to six significant digits.

The question expects a single numerical value for ΔS°, which should carry the unit J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹.

Candidate 1: –191.2 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹  
Candidate 2: –198.7 J/K (mol⁻¹ not stated)

1. Units: Candidate 2 omits “per mol,” creating ambiguity (Rule 1).  
2. Numerical value: Even if we assumed the missing “mol⁻¹,” the two values differ (–191.200 vs –198.700; they do not match to 6 significant digits, Rule 4).

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives “5.85 10⁴” with no unit, whereas Candidate 2 specifies “5.85 × 10⁴ K.”  
Because temperature could reasonably be expressed in different units (Kelvin, Celsius, etc.), the omission of a unit in Candidate 1 introduces ambiguity. According to Rule 1, this makes the answers inequivalent.

The units are the same (J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹), so compare the numerical values.

Candidate 1: 146 → 146.000 (to six significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 146.3 → 146.300 (to six significant digits)

146.000 and 146.300 differ in the third decimal place, so they are not the same to six significant digits.

Candidate 2: 15 394 yr (already in years).

Express both in the same units with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 15 400.0 yr (or 4.86000 × 10¹¹ s)  
• Candidate 2 → 15 394.0 yr (or 4.85798 × 10¹¹ s)

The numbers differ beginning at the third significant digit (154000 vs 153940) and therefore do not match to six significant digits.

The two candidates give the age in different units, so first convert Candidate 1’s result to years.

1 year ≈ 3.15576 × 10^7 s  
Candidate 1: 4.86 × 10^11 s  
Age = (4.86 × 10^11 s)/(3.15576 × 10^7 s yr⁻¹) ≈ 1.54004 × 10^4 yr ≈ 15 400 yr

Candidate 2 states the age directly as 15 400 years.

Now compare the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 (in years): 1.54004 × 10^4  
• Candidate 2:            1.54000 × 10^4  

They differ at the 5th significant digit, so they do **not** match to 6 significant digits. Hence, according to the strict comparison rule, the answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 9.6 × 10⁻⁶ m²/s = 0.96 × 10⁻⁵ m²/s

Expressed with the same exponent (10⁻⁵), the numbers are 1.10000 and 0.960000.  
They differ already in the first two significant digits and therefore are not equal to 6 significant figures.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The result that needs to be reported is an entropy change, whose correct unit is J K⁻¹.

• Candidate 1: “24.4  J K⁻¹” – supplies the correct numerical value with the appropriate entropy unit.

• Candidate 2: “24.4  J” – supplies the same numerical value but omits “per kelvin,” giving a unit of energy rather than entropy and introducing ambiguity.

Because the units differ and candidate 2’s answer lacks the required “per kelvin,” the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 1).

Both candidates give the same numerical value and the same unit.

• Candidate 1: “1.51 10⁴ bar” (understood as 1.51 × 10⁴ bar)  
• Candidate 2: “1.51 × 10⁴ bar”

Same unit (bar) and same magnitude (1.51 × 10⁴). Thus the predictions are equivalent.

The task asks for four separate residues modulo 24, each potentially depending on the integers n and α.

• Candidate 1 claims all four expressions are congruent to 0 (mod 24).  
• Candidate 2 gives distinct formulas for the four residues:  
  1) 9 n + 18 α + 4,  
  2) 9 n + 18 α + 7,  
  3) 9 n + 18 α + 13,  
  4) 9 n + 18 α + 16  (all taken mod 24).

These two sets of answers are clearly different: Candidate 2’s residues are generally not equal to 0 (mod 24) for arbitrary n and α, whereas Candidate 1 asserts they always are. Therefore, by Rule 2 (multiple sub-answers must match exactly) and basic arithmetic, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are different.

Candidate 1  
F₁(z,q)=(-zq;q²)₍∞₎ /(zq;q)₍∞₎

Candidate 2  
F₂(z,q)=∏_{n=1}^{∞} 1/(1−zqⁿ)=1/(zq;q)₍∞₎

Since
1/(zq;q)₍∞₎ = F₂(z,q),

we can write candidate 1 as  
F₁(z,q)=(-zq;q²)₍∞₎ · F₂(z,q).

The extra factor  
(-zq;q²)₍∞₎ = ∏_{k=0}^{∞}(1+zq^{1+2k})  
is not identically equal to 1, so F₁ and F₂ are different formal power series.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are different:

• Candidate 1 F_c(z,q) = (-z q; q²)_∞ / (z q; q)_∞  
  = ∏_{k=0}^{∞}(1 + z q^{2k+1}) / ∏_{n=1}^{∞}(1 − z q^{n})

• Candidate 2 F_c(z,q) = ∏_{n=1}^{∞} 1/(1 − z q^{n})  
  = 1 / (z q; q)_∞

Candidate 1 contains the extra factor (−z q; q²)_∞ = ∏_{k=0}^{∞}(1 + z q^{2k+1}), which is not identically 1, so the two expressions are not equal in general.

Candidate 1 gives
• (if e₀ = 0) aw = 2 + Σ_{i≤ℓ} eᵢ + 2 Σ_{i>ℓ} eᵢ  
• (if e₀ ≥ 1) aw = 3 + Σ_{i≤ℓ} eᵢ + 2 Σ_{i>ℓ} eᵢ  

Candidate 2 gives  
 aw = 3 e₀ + 3 Σ_{i≤ℓ} eᵢ + 4 Σ_{i>ℓ} eᵢ.

These formulas are plainly different: in Candidate 1 the coefficients of eᵢ are 1 or 2, while in Candidate 2 they are 3 or 4; Candidate 1 also contains only a constant term 2 or 3, whereas Candidate 2 contains coefficients multiplied by e₀, eᵢ instead of an overall constant. For example, with e₀ = 0, ℓ = 1, s = 1, and e₁ = 2, Candidate 1 gives aw = 4 whereas Candidate 2 gives aw = 6. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are

Candidate 1: 1 / (2^{\(\binom{m}{2}\)} m!)

Candidate 2: (1 / m!) · (1/4)^{\(\binom{m}{2}\)}.

Because  
(1/4)^{\(\binom{m}{2}\)} = (2^{-2})^{\(\binom{m}{2}\)} = 2^{-2\binom{m}{2}},  
while  
1/2^{\(\binom{m}{2}\)} = 2^{-\binom{m}{2}},  

the two candidates differ by a factor of 2^{- \(\binom{m}{2}\)} (except when \(\binom{m}{2}=0\), i.e. m = 0 or 1). For general m ≥ 1 they are not equal.

The two expressions are different elements of GW(𝔽_q).

Candidate 1 expands to
 [ binom(n,j) – binom((n–2)/2 , (j–1)/2) ] · 1 + binom((n–2)/2 , (j–1)/2) · u,

whereas Candidate 2 is
 0 · 1 + binom(n,j) · u.

Since, in general, binom(n,j) ≠ binom((n–2)/2 , (j–1)/2) and the coefficient of 1 is different (non-zero vs. zero), the two elements are not the same in GW(𝔽_q). Thus the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for three separate pieces of information:
1. \([T(R),T(R)]\)
2. \(\dim_{Z(R)} R\)
3. The type of the involution \(*\)

Comparison of the two candidates:

1. \([T(R),T(R)]\): both candidates give \(0\) – they agree.
2. \(\dim_{Z(R)} R\): candidate 1 says \(4\); candidate 2 says \(1\) – they disagree.
3. Type of involution: both state “first kind,” so they agree here.

Because at least one of the required sub-answers differs (the second one), the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both answers describe the ring of integers in a quadratic field.  
For square-free d, the only possible congruence classes mod 4 are 1, 2, 3 (0 is impossible because d square-free cannot be divisible by 4).

• Candidate 1:  
 O_K = Z[√d] if d ≢ 1 (mod 4) → this covers d ≡ 2 or 3.  
 O_K = Z[(1+√d)/2] if d ≡ 1 (mod 4).

• Candidate 2:  
 O_K = Z[√d] if d ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4).  
 O_K = Z[(1+√d)/2] if d ≡ 1 (mod 4).

The two descriptions match exactly for every square-free d. Hence the candidates are equivalent.

The question has four sub-cases (a)–(d), so each candidate must supply four corresponding values.

• Candidate 1 supplies:  
(a) 1, (b) 2, (c) 3, (d) 4.

• Candidate 2 supplies:  
(a) 2, (b) 2, (c) 2, (d) 2.

Comparing sub-case by sub-case, the answers differ in cases (a), (c), and (d). Because at least one sub-answer is different, the two candidate predictions are not identical (Rule 2).

For k = 2, Candidate 1 gives 0.5 while Candidate 2 gives 1; for k = 3, Candidate 1 gives 6/27 ≈ 0.222 while Candidate 2 gives 1. Therefore the two answers are not numerically or algebraically the same. They are inequivalent.

• Candidate 1 includes, for every k ≥ 2, the solutions (1,0,k,1) (with m = 0) and also includes pairs with m = 3 such as (0,3,2,1) and (0,3,2,2).

• Candidate 2 never lists any solution with m = 0 or m = 3; instead it gives families with m = 1 or m = 2, e.g. (1,1,k,x), (0,1,k,x), (3,2,2,2), etc.

Because the two answer sets contain different solutions and omit ones that the other includes, they are not the same. Hence the predictions are inequivalent.

The two expressions are not algebraically identical:

Candidate 1: C₁ =  binom{n-1}{k-1} − binom{n-k-1}{k-1} − binom{n-k-2}{k-2} + 2  
Candidate 2: C₂ =  binom{n-1}{k-1} − 1

Their difference is  
C₁ − C₂ = − binom{n-k-1}{k-1} − binom{n-k-2}{k-2} + 3.

For the two candidates to be equivalent, the right‐hand side would have to be zero for all admissible n and k, i.e.  
binom{n-k-1}{k-1} + binom{n-k-2}{k-2} ≡ 3,  
which is false in general (e.g. for k = 3, n = 7 it already fails).

Hence the two candidate bounds are not the same.

The two expressions differ by the term  

- C(n − k − 2, k − 2) + 1.

Since k ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2k + 1, the binomial coefficient C(n − k − 2, k − 2) is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, so the two bounds cannot be the same in general. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for the complete Steklov-Lamé spectrum (all eigenvalues with their multiplicities).  

Candidate 1 lists five distinct groups of eigenvalues, including the triple zero eigenvalue and two different infinite families, each with stated multiplicities.

Candidate 2 lists only  
• one single eigenvalue \(2(\lambda+\mu)/R\), and  
• one infinite family \(\bigl[n(n+1)\mu+2(\lambda+\mu)\bigr]/R\) (multiplicity 2).  

Candidate 2 omits the zero eigenvalue and the families \(2\mu(n-1)/R\) and \(2(n+1)\mu(\lambda+\mu)/[(\lambda+3\mu)R]\) that appear in Candidate 1, and its second family does not match either of the families in Candidate 1. Hence the two spectra are different.

Candidate 1 gives a detailed piecewise formula involving multinomial coefficients; the values clearly vary with s and d.

Candidate 2 lists two contradictory tiny piecewise possibilities (“answer 1” and “answer 2”) that only give 0 or 1 and does not commit to one of them.  Even ignoring the contradiction, either of those constant answers is completely different from Candidate 1’s non-constant formula.

Thus the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two proposed formulas are clearly different:

• Candidate 1 keeps only those subspace dimensions congruent to ⎣n/2⎦ modulo (t+1), giving roughly (n+1)/(t+1) terms spread across the whole range 0,…,n.

• Candidate 2 sums the last t terms (dimensions n–t+1,…,n).

Since these index sets are generally not the same (e.g. for n = 10, t = 1, candidate 1 sums over all odd ℓ while candidate 2 sums only k = 10), the resulting cardinalities are not equal.

• Candidate 2 coefficient: \((\lambda\beta)^{m} = \beta^{m}\lambda^{m}\)

Unless \(\frac{m!}{\Gamma(m\beta+1)} = \beta^{m}\) for every \(m\) and every \(\beta\) (which is not true in general), the two series are not the same. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Because the factors multiplying S(n,m) differ (candidate 1 has m!/Γ(mβ+1); candidate 2 has β^m), the expressions are not the same.

• Candidate 2:

The two candidates are **not** equivalent.

Reasoning:

• Candidate 1 requires Ω to be (up to measure-zero) a ball centred at an arbitrary point (x₀, ω₀) and f to be any translated-and-modulated Gaussian (c e^{2πi x·ω₀} φ(x−x₀)).  
• Candidate 2 merely says Ω is “a ball” and f “a Gaussian”. It does not state that the ball may be centred anywhere nor that f may be translated/modulated by arbitrary shifts and frequencies.

Thus Candidate 2 gives a strictly more restrictive/ambiguous set of conditions than Candidate 1, so the two answers do not match.
Both candidates agree that  
• Ω must be (essentially) a ball of finite measure.

For the function f, however:  
• Candidate 1 demands f be a translate-and-modulate of a fixed Gaussian,
  f(x)=c e^{2πi x·ω₀} φ(x−x₀).  
• Candidate 2 only says “f is a Gaussian function,” without specifying whether all
translations/modulations (or only the centred, un-modulated Gaussian) are allowed.

Thus Candidate 2 is less specific and could permit or exclude cases that Candidate 1
explicitly requires.  Because the two descriptions of f are not guaranteed to match,
the answers are not fully equivalent.

• Candidate 2 gives  
 (2^{8} − 2^{6} + 2·2^{5}) / 2 = 256 / 2 = 128.  

Since 112 ≠ 128, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for TWO specific pieces of information:  
1) the orientation that f must have, and  
2) the value of its similarity ratio.

• Both candidates give a similarity ratio of 1, so they match on that part.  
• Their statements about orientation, however, are different:

  – Candidate 1: “non-oblique” (i.e. axis-aligned, no rotation).  
  – Candidate 2: “orientation must be preserved” (i.e. determinant > 0, forbids reflections but still allows rotations).

These describe different conditions, so the two answers are not identical for the orientation requirement.

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 contains no parameter \(m\); it is purely in terms of \(n\) and \(\gamma\) (with ordinary Pochhammer symbols and Gamma functions).

Both candidates supply two numerical expressions for the surface-crossing number, namely  

• 6g  
• 6g − 3  

Candidate 1 explicitly ties “6g” to the n ≡ 0 (mod 12) case and “6g − 3” to the n ≡ 6 (mod 12) case.  
Candidate 2 lists the same two expressions as “answer 1” and “answer 2.” Given that the question presents the two residue classes in the order n ≡ 0, then n ≡ 6, the natural reading is that “answer 1” corresponds to the first case and “answer 2” to the second. Thus the mathematical content of the two answers matches exactly.

No units are involved and the required number of sub-answers is satisfied in both cases.

Candidate 1 states that  
γ_P(K_m □ K_{1,n}) = min{ m − 1, n − 1 }.

Candidate 2 states that  
γ_P(K_m □ K_{1,n}) = 1.

For m,n ≥ 3 we have m − 1 ≥ 2 and n − 1 ≥ 2, so Candidate 1’s value is at least 2, whereas Candidate 2’s value is 1. The two answers are therefore different.

The two candidates are NOT equivalent.

Key differences:
1. Dependence on r_\infty:  
 • Candidate 1’s exponent contains “(λ_E – r_∞) n”;  
 • Candidate 2’s exponent contains simply “λ n” with no r_∞ term.  
 Unless one explicitly identifies λ with (λ_E – r_∞), the formulas differ by a term that grows linearly with n.

2. Sign/location of ν:  
 • Candidate 1 puts “+ ν” in the exponent.  
 • Candidate 2 puts “– ν” in the exponent but multiplies by an unspecified constant C.  
 Although an overall constant could absorb a fixed power of p, this does not repair the missing r_∞ dependence.

3. Form of the statement: equality for large n (Candidate 1) versus only an asymptotic relation “∼ C ⋅ …” (Candidate 2).

Because of the missing r_∞ term (and the other discrepancies), the two answers are not the same.

The question asks for **all** integer solutions.  
Candidate 1 lists four solutions:  
• (1, 1, 1)  
• (1, 1, –1)  
• (1, –1, 0)  
• (–1, 1, 0)

Candidate 2 lists only three solutions:  
• (1, 1, 1)  
• (1, –1, 0)  
• (–1, 1, 0)

Candidate 2 omits the valid solution (1, 1, –1) that Candidate 1 includes.  
Because the two answer sets are not identical, the predictions are **not equivalent** (Rule 2).

Candidate 1: n! e^{x+y} / (e^{x}+e^{y}-e^{x+y})^{\,n+1}

Candidate 2: y e^{n x} / (e^{y}-1)

They have distinct functional dependence on x, y, and n (note the presence of n! and the factor y in different places, and the very different denominators). Hence they cannot be algebraically identical.

The candidates give two different explicit formulas for λ:

• Candidate 1: λ = 1 − (2 δ)/[(n − 1) diam²]

• Candidate 2: λ = 1 − δ/(n · diam)

These expressions are not algebraically the same (different powers of diam, different numerical factors, different use of n vs. n − 1). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical expressions:

• Candidate 1:  χ_q = n + 1  
• Candidate 2:  χ_q = 3

These coincide only if n + 1 = 3, i.e. n = 2, but the problem restricts n to values of the form n = 4t − 1 (t ≥ 1), giving n = 3, 7, 11, …; for these n, n + 1 ≠ 3. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give exactly the same rational function.

•  Candidate 1 (already rewritten)  
   (1 – q + q³)/(1 – 2q + 2q³ – q⁴)

•  Candidate 2  
   (q³ – q + 1)/[(1 – q)³(1 + q)]

Expanding the denominator of Candidate 2:  
(1 – q)³(1 + q) = (1 – 3q + 3q² – q³)(1 + q)  
                  = 1 – 2q + 2q³ – q⁴

This matches Candidate 1’s denominator exactly, and the numerators are the same up to ordering of terms.  
Therefore the two expressions are algebraically identical.

The two expressions are structurally different:

• Candidate 1:  inf_{D ∈ 𝒟_n(X)} max { diam D, λ − α(D), diam X − λ }

  – contains λ explicitly;
  – takes an infimum over D;
  – the maximand involves three terms.

• Candidate 2:  max { diam X, diam D + α(D) }

  – λ is absent;
  – there is no infimum over D;
  – the maximand involves only two terms and depends on D in a different way.

Since the expressions involve different variables, different operations (infimum in one, none in the other), and their sets of maximized terms are not the same, they cannot be algebraically or functionally equivalent.

The two answers give different explicit formulas.

• Candidate 1:  (Γ(γ+1) / Γ_m(γ+1)) (1−m)^{−γ}.  
  (Here Γ_m is the q-gamma function with base m.)

• Candidate 2:  Γ(γ+1) / m^{γ+1}.

Setting γ = 0 illustrates the discrepancy:

 Candidate 1 → 1 / Γ_m(1) = 1 (since Γ_m(1)=1),  
 Candidate 2 → 1 / m.

Unless m = 1 (which is excluded because (m;m)_k would vanish), the two results differ. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical/formula answer (the cardinality of the set).  

• Candidate 1 gives the formula  
  C₁ =  \(\displaystyle \binom{\frac{s-2}{2}+\frac{t-1}{2}}{\frac{s-2}{2}}\).

• Candidate 2 gives the formula  
  C₂ =  \(\tau(s)\tau(t)\) (product of the divisor‐count functions of \(s\) and \(t\)).

These two expressions are plainly different algebraic functions of \(s\) and \(t\).  
For instance, with \(s=2,\; t=3\) (which satisfy the given conditions),  
 C₁ = \(\binom{0+1}{0}=1\) whereas  
 C₂ = \(\tau(2)\tau(3)=2\cdot2=4\).  
Since they yield different results, the answers are not equivalent.

Hence, according to Rule 1/Rule 4, the candidates are inequivalent.
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

• Candidate 1:  C = 𝚿((s-2)/2 + (t-1)/2 , (s-2)/2)  (a binomial coefficient)  
• Candidate 2:  C = s + t – 1  (a linear expression)

They clearly are not the same formula, and simple test values (e.g. s = 2, t = 1 or s = 4, t = 3) already give different numerical results. Therefore the predictions are inequivalent.

The two candidates give completely different closed-form formulas.

• Candidate 1 expresses S_D and S_P as finite q-Pochhammer products up to ⌈N/2⌉ and involves the factor (–q^r).

• Candidate 2 expresses its two answers as infinite products ((ab; (ab)^2)_∞ etc.) and uses different parameters; it does not depend on N at all and has no (–q^r) factor.

Since the functional forms, the dependence on N, and several parameters differ, the two sets of answers cannot be the same.

    ≠ x(x^{10}+x^{8}+2x^{6}-4x^{4}+4x^{2}-1),

since, for example, the constant term on the left side is –1 while on the right side it is 0.

Evaluating both at \(c=5\) (which is allowed since \(c\ge 3\)):

 Candidate 1: \(s(5)=\dfrac{(3\cdot5+5)2^{2}+(-1)^5(5-15)}{9}
= \dfrac{20\cdot4+(-1)(-10)}{9}
= \dfrac{80+10}{9}=10.\)

The two candidates give different formulas:

• Candidate 1:  ∑_{ℓ=0, ℓ ≡ ⌊n/2⌋ (mod (t+1))}^n  C(n, ℓ)

• Candidate 2:  2^{\,n − t}

These are plainly not the same expression for general n and t (e.g., for t=1, n=4 the first gives C(4,2)=6, while the second gives 2^{3}=8). Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2:  2^{\,n-t}

These expressions are plainly not the same for general n and t (they scale differently and coincide, if ever, only in special accidental cases). Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
S = k − e^{−k t} ∑_{s=0}^{k−1} (k−s) [ L_s^{(−1)}(k t) ]^2  

Candidate 2 gives  
S = ∑_{s=0}^{∞} L_s^{(−1)}(k t) t^{s}  

These two formulas are structurally different: one is a finite sum with an exponential factor, squared Laguerre polynomials, and coefficient (k − s); the other is an infinite power series with no exponential, no squares, and no (k − s) factor.  There is no algebraic manipulation that turns one into the other given the symbols as stated.  

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give entirely different mathematical expressions for the limit \(S_N(k;t)\):

• Candidate 1: \(k - e^{-kt}\displaystyle\sum_{s=0}^{k-1} (k-s)\bigl(L_s^{(-1)}(kt)\bigr)^2\)

• Candidate 2: \(\displaystyle\sum_{s=0}^{\infty} L_s^{(-1)}(kt)\,t^{s}\)

These expressions have different functional forms, different summation ranges (finite vs. infinite), different extra factors (\(k\) and \(e^{-kt}\) vs. \(t^{s}\)), and thus cannot be algebraically identical for general \(k\) and \(t\). Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

 4 Γ(p) / Γ(p/2)

in front of the integral/‖∇ₕ f‖ₚᵖ.  
For p = 2 this factor is 4, and in general it is not equal to 1.

The question asks for the specific distributions that form the saddle-point.  
Candidate 1 specifies zero-mean Gaussian distributions whose covariance matrices are  
• \(P_X : \tfrac{P}{n}\,I_{n}\) and  
• \(P_Z : \tfrac{N}{n}\,I_{n}\).

Candidate 2 specifies zero-mean Gaussians with (scalar) variances  
• \(P_X : P\) and  
• \(P_Z : N\).

Unless \(n=1\), these choices differ: Candidate 1’s total power equals \(P\) (since each of \(n\) coordinates has variance \(P/n\)), whereas Candidate 2 would have total power \(nP\). The two candidates therefore give different distributions in general, and the answers cannot be regarded as the same.

• Candidate 2: \(N(m,\,n)=\dfrac{1}{m}\binom{m}{n}\binom{m}{\,n-1}\).

The parameters fed to the Narayana number (and therefore the numerical values) differ (\((m+n,n)\) vs \((m,n)\)), and the prefactors \(1/(m+n)\) vs \(1/m\) are not equal in general. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 multiplies \(1/|\operatorname{Aut}_{R_j}(G_j)|\) by an extra Euler-type factor  
\(\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}(1-p^{-i\deg(P_j)})\) for every \(j\).

Candidate 2 includes only the factor \(1/|\operatorname{Aut}_{R_j}(G_j)|\) and omits that infinite product.

Since \(\prod_{i=1}^{\infty}(1-p^{-i\deg(P_j)})\neq 1\) for any positive degree, the two expressions are not equal. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas for both the interpolating function and its norm.

• Candidate 1 supplies a formula that depends on p, with the factor  
  (1 – ‖z₀‖²) raised to 2(n+1)/p in f₍min₎ and (n+1)/p in the norm.

• Candidate 2 writes the interpolant as w₀ K(z,z₀)/‖K(·,z₀)‖ and the norm as |w₀|/‖K(·,z₀)‖.  Interpreting K as the usual Bergman kernel gives powers of (1 – ‖z₀‖²) only with exponent (n+1)/2, independent of p.

Hence, unless p happens to equal 2, the answers disagree, and even for p = 2 the power of (1 – ‖z₀‖²) in f₍min₎ differs ((n+1) versus (n+1)/2).  Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give essentially the same “answer”:  
• Candidate 1 says that χ is the unique function that satisfies the displayed functional equations (on ℕ₀ʳ and by rising-continuation on ℤₚʳ).  
• Candidate 2 likewise says that χ is the unique rising-continuous function determined recursively by the same equations, adding only the observation that one may write it as an infinite series over the base-p digits.

Candidate 2 does not impose any additional, incompatible condition nor provide a different formula; it only elaborates on exactly the same characterization that Candidate 1 uses. Therefore both candidates identify the same object and are equivalent answers.

The two candidates give different expressions when \(\ell_j > 1+\sqrt{\gamma}\).

• Candidate 1: \(\hat{\ell}_j \to \ell_j\!\left(1+\dfrac{\gamma}{\ell_j-1}\right)\), which is strictly larger than both \(\ell_j\) and \((1+\sqrt{\gamma})^{2}\) for \(\gamma>0\).

• Candidate 2: \(\hat{\ell}_j \to \max\bigl(\ell_j,\,(1+\sqrt{\gamma})^{2}\bigr)\).

Thus, for \(\ell_j > (1+\sqrt{\gamma})^{2}\), Candidate 2 yields \(\ell_j\) whereas Candidate 1 yields the larger value above; and for \(1+\sqrt{\gamma} < \ell_j < (1+\sqrt{\gamma})^{2}\), Candidate 2 still gives \((1+\sqrt{\gamma})^{2}\) while Candidate 1 gives a value slightly bigger than that. Hence the predictions are not the same.

Since (q²;q²)_∞ / (q;q)_∞ = ∏_{n=1}^{∞}(1+q^{n}) ≠ 1/(q;q)_∞, the two expressions are not the same.

For Φ:
• Candidate 1: Φ = 1/(q;q)_∞²  
• Candidate 2: Φ = 1/(q;q²)_∞ = 1/∏_{n odd}(1−q^{n})

These are also clearly different.

• Candidate 2 simply sums two ranks for each pair:

Both candidates answer both sub-problems, but they disagree on sub-problem (i):

• Candidate 1: N_\mu(𝔷) = 1 for every 𝔷.  
• Candidate 2: N_\mu(𝔷) = 0 for every 𝔷.

Since at least one requested answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different explicit expressions for both S₁ and S₂:

• For S₁:  
 Candidate 1 → (u;q²)∞  
 Candidate 2 → (u;q²)∞ / (u;q)∞  

These two expressions are only equal if (u;q)∞ = 1, which is not true in general.

• For S₂:  
 Candidate 1 → (u;q)∞  
 Candidate 2 → (u;q²)∞ / (u;q)∞  

Again, the two expressions are not the same for generic u and q.

Since at least one of the sub-answers differs, the sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question asks for a single 5-tuple \((|x|, |y|, \alpha, p, |s^\beta z^3|)\).  
Candidate 1 proposes (2, 1, 1, 7, 125).  
Candidate 2 proposes (3, 1, 0, 5, 16).

These tuples differ in four of the five components (first, third, fourth, and fifth entries). Therefore the answers are not the same.

Candidate 2: F = 1/3 ≈ 0.333333

These differ well beyond 6 significant digits, so they are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not obviously giving the same quantity:

• Candidate 1 states the answer is “\(M_n\)” but does not tell us what \(M_n\) equals.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly gives \(\displaystyle \frac{1}{\,n+1}\binom{2n}{n}\).

Unless one already knows (from outside this exchange) that \(M_n\) is defined to be \(\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}\), there is no way to verify an equivalence. Within the information provided here, \(M_n\) is an undefined symbol, so the two answers are not guaranteed to match.

The question asks for a single numerical/sequential quantity (a function of n).  

• Candidate 1 says the value is “\(M_n\)” (without defining \(M_n\)).  
• Candidate 2 says the value is the Catalan number \(\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}\).

Unless the symbol \(M_n\) is explicitly defined in the problem statement to be the Catalan number, the two assertions are different: \(M_n\) could represent Motzkin numbers (a common usage) or something else entirely. Because the equivalence of \(M_n\) and the Catalan number is not established in either the question or the candidates’ answers, the two predictions cannot be regarded as the same.

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give explicit closed-form formulas.  
Candidate 1: C(2 n − 2 − k, k)  
Candidate 2: (1/n) · C(n, k) · C(n, k+1)

To see whether they coincide, evaluate both for the same (n, k):

Example (n, k) = (4, 1):
 Candidate 1 = C(2·4 – 2 – 1, 1) = C(5, 1) = 5  
 Candidate 2 = (1/4)·C(4, 1)·C(4, 2) = (1/4)·4·6 = 6  

Since 5 ≠ 6, the two expressions are not identical functions; hence the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different closed-form expressions:

Candidate 1:  C₁ = 𝑪(2n − 2 − k, k)

Candidate 2:  C₂ = N(n,k+1) = (1/n) 𝑪(n,k+1) 𝑪(n,k)

Checking concrete values shows they disagree; e.g. for n = 4, k = 1

 C₁ = 𝑪(5,1)=5, C₂ = (1/4)·𝑪(4,2)·𝑪(4,1)=6.

Since the two formulas are not equal, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas.

Candidate 1:  
• \(m_k = q^k\,m_0\)

Candidate 2:  
• \(m_k = (q+1)^k\,m_0\)  
• \(n_k = (q+1)^k\,m_0 + (n_0-m_0) q^k\)

Since \(q^k \neq (q+1)^k\) in general, the expressions for \(m_k\) already differ, making the answers inequivalent. The \(n_k\) expressions also clearly differ.

The two candidates give different algebraic formulas:

• Candidate 1: ⌈[(n−3)(n−4) − 2t]/12⌉  
• Candidate 2: ⌈[(n−2)(t−2)]/4⌉

These simplify to, respectively,

  ⌈(n² − 7n + 12 − 2t)/12⌉ and ⌈((n−2)t − 2n + 4)/4⌉,

which are not the same expression.  
A quick check with n = 6, t = 0 (allowed by the problem) gives:

  Candidate 1 → ⌈(3 − 0)/6⌉ = ⌈0.5⌉ = 1  
  Candidate 2 → ⌈−2⌉ = −2

Since the two results differ, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two formulas give different numerical values in general (e.g.\ for \(n=6,\;t=0\) they yield \(\lceil 0.5\rceil =1\) versus \(\lceil-2\rceil=-2\)), so they are not algebraically or numerically the same.

Both candidates state that the Conley–Zehnder index equals one-half of the signature of the matrix \(S\):

• Candidate 1: \(\conleyzehnder(A)=\tfrac12\signature(S)\)  
• Candidate 2: \(\tfrac12\,\sigma(S)\)  (with \(\sigma\) standing for the signature)

These expressions are identical.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 says  
 conleyzehnder(A) = ½ · signature(S).

Candidate 2 says  
 conleyzehnder(A) = signature(S).

These two expressions differ by a factor of 2 and are therefore not the same answer. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a detailed decomposition of the bipartite divisor graph  
(components such as “ K₂ ⨿ K_{1,3} ⨿ … ”), while Candidate 2 merely states how many conjugacy classes of subgroups there are in each case (“10” for p = 2; “p²+3” for p ≥ 3).  

These are not the same quantities and do not supply the same information required by the question. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 specifies the solution space as

Candidate 2 gives only C^{2, α}(Ω̄) without the integral condition.  
Because Candidate 1 adds an additional requirement that is absent in Candidate 2, the two answers describe different (nested) sets, not the same one.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different algebraic expressions:

Candidate 2:  
  # c𝒮 = C(m+n, m) · C(r+s, k)

The two formulas involve different functional dependencies on the parameters m, n, r, s, k (for example, Candidate 1 depends on m–r, n–s, etc., whereas Candidate 2 depends only on m+n and r+s). Since they are not algebraically identical and cannot coincide for all admissible parameter values, the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 expresses each z as a ratio of products of four lambda lengths (with one of them having a minus sign), and also asserts the equalities z_{01}=z_{23}, z_{02}=z_{13}, z_{03}=z_{12}.  
• Candidate 2 says each shape parameter is simply e^{-\lambda_{ij}}, with no ratios and no cross-edge equalities.

These expressions cannot be algebraically or numerically transformed into one another without introducing additional, unstated relationships (there is no way that a single exponential of one lambda length equals the given rational function of four others in general). Hence, the two candidates are not equivalent.

  – Candidate 2: { 2r − 2 − λ₂, …, 2r − 2 − λₙ, 2r − 2 − r }.

These sets are not the same (λ_i + r − 2 ≠ 2r − 2 − λ_i in general, and the extra eigenvalue −2 with multiplicity m−n is missing/mis-stated in Candidate 2).

• Candidate 2: C(4, 2) · (4 − 1)!! / [ (2 − 1)!! (2 − 1)!! ]

The question asks for the unique absolute value on K expressed via the norm.  

Candidate 1:   | 𝔂 |ₖ = | N_K(𝔂) |ₚ^{1/d}  
Candidate 2:   | x |ₖ = | N_{K/ℚ_p}(x) |ₚ^{1/d}

Both candidates give the same functional rule:
• same exponent 1/d  
• same p-adic absolute value |·|ₚ  
• same norm (N_K is standard shorthand for N_{K/ℚ_p})  
• only a change of dummy variable (𝔂 vs x).

Thus they define identical absolute values on K.

The two expressions are clearly different:

Candidate 1: \((q^{1/2};q)_\infty^2 /(q;q)_\infty\)

Candidate 2: \((1-q^{1/2})(q;q)_\infty^2\)

The infinite-product factors appearing in Candidate 1 involve only half-integer powers of \(q\) (squared) divided by a single copy of \((q;q)_\infty\), whereas Candidate 2 involves a single \((1-q^{1/2})\) factor times \((q;q)_\infty\) squared.  The locations and multiplicities of the factors \((1-q^{n+1/2})\) and \((1-q^{n+1})\) do not match, so the two products cannot be algebraically identical.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two proposed closed-form expressions are  

Candidate 1: ( q^{1/2}; q )_∞² / (q; q)_∞  

Candidate 2: (1 − q^{1/2})(q; q)_∞².

Using the definition (a;q)_∞ = ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−a q^{n}) we have  

(q^{1/2}; q)_∞² = ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−q^{n+1/2})²,  
(q; q)_∞   = ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−q^{n+1}).

Thus  

Candidate 1 = ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−q^{n+1/2})² / ∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−q^{n+1}).  

Candidate 2 = (1−q^{1/2}) [∏_{n=0}^{∞}(1−q^{n+1})]².

For the two candidates to be equal we would need  

(q^{1/2}; q)_∞² = (1−q^{1/2})(q; q)_∞³,

which is not a known identity and in fact is false.  
A quick series expansion corroborates this:

• Candidate 1 ≈ 1 − 2q^{1/2} + q + …  
• Candidate 2 ≈ 1 − q^{1/2} − 2q + …

The coefficients already differ at order q^{1/2}. Therefore the two expressions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 1.73.  
Candidate 2 explicitly appends the unit “m/s²,” while Candidate 1 omits the unit.  
Because the question itself specifies the desired unit (“in metre per second squared”), there is essentially only one reasonable unit choice, so the omission in Candidate 1 does not create ambiguity.  

Numeric comparison to six significant digits:  
1.73 → 1.73000  
1.73 → 1.73000  

They match exactly.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

The question explicitly asks for acceleration in the unit m/(min²).  
• Candidate 1 gives “−120” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “−120 m/min²”.

Because Candidate 1 omits the unit, and more than one reasonable unit for acceleration could be assumed (e.g., m/s² vs m/min²), this omission introduces ambiguity. According to Rule 1, when such ambiguity exists, the answers are considered inequivalent.

The two answers represent numerical values.

• Candidate 1: 0.66667  
  – Interpreted to six significant digits: 0.666670

• Candidate 2: 2/3 = 0.666666…  
  – Rounded (or written) to six significant digits: 0.666667

Comparing the six-significant-digit forms, 0.666670 ≠ 0.666667.  
Rule 4 states that if the numbers do not match exactly to six significant digits, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

The two answers are numerical values.

Expressing each to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.66667 → 0.666670  
• Candidate 2: 2/3 = 0.666666… → 0.666667

Since 0.666670 and 0.666667 differ in the sixth significant digit, the answers do not match to six significant digits.

The two answers give numerical values of 114.5 (implicit units) and 114.6 GeV.  
Expressed to six significant digits these are 114.500 and 114.600, which differ in the third decimal place.  
Because they do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4), the predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for:

1. The expected time lost per second (in ps/s) for the moving clock.  
2. A comparison with the measured result (-295.02 ps/s, etc.).

Candidate 1 supplies only one number: “330.76” (no sign, no explicit unit, no comparison).  
Candidate 2 supplies:

• expected time lost per second: –330.4 ps/s  
• measured result: –295.02 ps/s (+35 ps/s GR contribution)

Thus:

• Candidate 1 omits the comparison portion entirely (violating Rule 2).  
• Even for the expected value, Candidate 1 gives +330.76 while Candidate 2 gives –330.4, differing in sign and therefore not matching to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The numerical value of π/16 is 0.1963495408…, which to six significant digits is 0.196350.  
Candidate 1 gives 0.19634 → 0.196340 to six significant digits.  
Comparing 0.196340 and 0.196350, they differ at the 5th–6th significant digit, so the two answers are not the same to six significant digits.

The units are the same (bits) but the numerical values differ:

• Candidate 1: 2.03000 (extended to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 2.02970

Since the numbers are not identical to six significant digits, they are not equivalent (Rule 4).

The question asks for a single probability value.

Candidate 1 gives 0.6667 → 0.666700 (to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives 1/3 → 0.333333 (to six significant digits).

0.666700 ≠ 0.333333, so the answers are different.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, “2”.  
Candidate 2 explicitly writes the unit “seconds”, while Candidate 1 omits the unit.  
For a signal period, seconds are the standard and only sensible unit in this context, so the omission does not create genuine ambiguity. Therefore the two answers convey the same quantity.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two answers differ in their inclusion of units.

• Candidate 1: “2” – no unit given.  
• Candidate 2: “2 s” – explicitly states seconds.

Because period is a time quantity and could in principle be expressed in various time units (seconds, milliseconds, minutes, etc.), omitting the unit introduces ambiguity. Under Rule 1, when one answer lacks a unit that could reasonably vary, the answers are considered inequivalent.

The question asks for a “rate of return.”  
Rates of return are commonly expressed either:

• as a percentage (e.g., 10.92 %), or  
• as a pure decimal (e.g., 0.1092).

Thus two different “units” (percent vs. unitless decimal) are both plausible in context.

Candidate 2 explicitly gives “10.92 %.”  
Candidate 1 gives “10.92” with no unit.  
Because the omission of the unit in Candidate 1 makes it ambiguous whether it is 10.92 % or the (improbable but possible) decimal 10.92, Rule 1 states the answers should be considered inequivalent when such ambiguity exists.

The numeric values written by the two candidates are the same (1.28 × 10⁻⁶).  
However, Candidate 1 supplies no unit, while Candidate 2 explicitly states “V/K”.  
Because the question specifically asks for an answer in V/K, the absence of a unit in Candidate 1 leaves room for ambiguity (e.g., it might be interpreted as micro-volts per kelvin instead of volts per kelvin).  
Under Rule 1, when an omitted unit can cause such ambiguity, the answers are considered inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The numeric values match (1.28 × 10⁻⁶), but Candidate 1 gives no unit while Candidate 2 explicitly states the required unit “V/K.”  
Because the question specifically asks for the result “in V/K,” omitting the unit introduces ambiguity, so according to Rule 1 the two answers are not regarded as equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The numeric values match (1.28 × 10⁻⁶), but:

• Candidate 1 gives no unit.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly states the required unit “V/K”.

According to Rule 1, omitting the unit when the problem specifies a unit introduces ambiguity, so the two answers are not considered equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 1.581 (interpreted, per Rule 4, as 1.581000 to six significant digits).

Candidate 2 gives the exact expression e / (e − 1).  
Numerically, e / (e − 1) ≈ 1.5819767.

Comparing to six significant digits:  

• Candidate 1: 1.581000  
• Candidate 2: 1.581977  (rounded)

Since 1.581000 ≠ 1.581977 at six significant-digit precision, the two predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers give the same numerical value, 291.45, and implicitly/explicitly use dollars as the unit, which is appropriate for a stock price. The presence or absence of the dollar sign does not change the numerical value or create ambiguity in this context. Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The two answers express the same quantity in different units, so convert Candidate 1 to joules per mole:

• Candidate 1: 7.3 kJ mol⁻¹ = 7300 J mol⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 7283 J mol⁻¹

Expressed with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 7.30000 × 10³ J mol⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 7.28300 × 10³ J mol⁻¹

Because 7.30000 × 10³ ≠ 7.28300 × 10³ at six significant digits, the two values are not identical.

Numerical comparison (expressed to six significant digits):

The two answers give the numerical value of R with the same units, so we compare the numbers to 6 significant digits.

Candidate 1: 8.3147 → 8.31470 (padded to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 8.319 → 8.31900 (padded to 6 significant digits)

Comparing digit-by-digit: 8.31470 differs from 8.31900 at the 4th significant digit (4 vs 9). Hence they do not match to 6 significant digits.

Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value: 0.  
Candidate 2 explicitly writes the unit “J/K,” while Candidate 1 omits the unit. For entropy in this context, the only reasonable unit is J K⁻¹, and the value is zero; zero is unchanged by unit choice. Therefore, the omission does not create ambiguity, and the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the value 0 for ΔS.  
• Candidate 1 writes simply “0” (no unit).  
• Candidate 2 writes “0 J/K”.

Because the value is zero, attaching or omitting the unit does not change the numerical result; 0 J/K = 0. The omission of the unit therefore does not create any real ambiguity in this specific case. Thus the two answers convey the same result.

The question asks for TWO values:  
1. the van der Waals constant b (with volume units),  
2. the compression factor Z (dimensionless).

Candidate 1 supplies only one number (“0.66”) with no unit or label, so it effectively answers at most one of the required items and omits the other.

Candidate 2 supplies both required items:  
• b = 4.6 × 10⁻⁵ m³ mol⁻¹  
• Z = 0.661

Because Candidate 1 fails to provide the van der Waals constant b, the two candidates are not equivalent according to Rule 2 (incomplete answer).

The question requires a single numerical value for the pressure (in a specific unit).  

Candidate 1 gives 21 atm, and Candidate 2 gives 24 atm.  
Both are expressed in the same unit, but the numerical values differ (21.0000 vs. 24.0000), so they are not the same to six significant digits.

Candidate 1: 11 kJ mol⁻¹  
→ 11 kJ mol⁻¹ = 11 000 J mol⁻¹ = 1.10000 × 10⁴ J mol⁻¹ (to six significant digits)

Candidate 2: 11 409.64 J mol⁻¹ = 1.140964 × 10⁴ J mol⁻¹ (to six significant digits)

Comparing 1.10000 × 10⁴ with 1.140964 × 10⁴ shows a difference in the second significant digit; they do not match to six significant digits. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical answers with the same units (kJ mol⁻¹), so we compare their values.

Candidate 1: −4564.7  →  −4564.70 (to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: −4564.5  →  −4564.50 (to 6 significant digits)

Comparing the 6-significant-digit representations:

−4564.70 ≠ −4564.50

Since the numbers differ within the first six significant digits, the answers are not equivalent.

The two answers give the same kind of quantity (energy per mole) but with different numerical values.

• Candidate 1: −0.28 Pa m³ mol⁻¹ = −0.28 J mol⁻¹ = −0.00028 kJ mol⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: −0.00029 kJ mol⁻¹

Expressed with six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: −0.000280000 kJ mol⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: −0.000290000 kJ mol⁻¹

The two values differ at the third significant digit (2.80000 ×10⁻⁴ vs 2.90000 ×10⁻⁴), so they are not equal to 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 17 kN mol⁻¹  
 = 17 × 10³ N mol⁻¹ = 17 000 N mol⁻¹

Candidate 2: 1.718 × 10⁴ J /(mol·m)  
Since 1 J = 1 N·m, J/(mol·m) = N mol⁻¹, so  
 = 1.718 × 10⁴ N mol⁻¹ = 17 180 N mol⁻¹

Comparing the numerical values to six significant digits:  
17 000.0 vs 17 180.0 – they differ in the third significant digit, so they are not equal.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives a value of 17 kN mol⁻¹ (i.e. 1.7 × 10⁴ N per mole).  
Candidate 2 gives a value of 2.85 × 10⁻²⁰ N (i.e. force on a single molecule/particle).

These quantities have different physical units: “N mol⁻¹” versus “N.”  Converting 17 kN mol⁻¹ to a per-molecule force (by dividing by Avogadro’s number) gives about 2.82 × 10⁻²⁰ N, which still differs from 2.85 × 10⁻²⁰ N at the required six-significant-digit level, and—more importantly—the problem statement does not indicate that such a conversion is intended. Thus the two answers correspond to different kinds of quantity and are not the same numerical result.

The question asks for a single numerical value (maximum distance) in AU.  
Both candidates supply a number in AU, so units match.

Express each answer with six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 35.64 AU → 35.6400 (six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 35.6373 AU → 35.6373 (six significant digits)

Comparing 3.56400 × 10¹ and 3.56373 × 10¹, they differ starting at the 4th significant digit.  
According to Rule 4, they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical answer with the same unit “ft·lb”.

• Candidate 1: 1838.50666349 ft·lb  
• Candidate 2: 1838.51 ft·lb  

Round Candidate 1 to 6 significant digits:

1838.50666349 → 1838.51 (since the 7th significant digit is 6, the 6th digit rounds up).

Candidate 2 already has 6 significant digits: 1838.51.

Thus, to 6 significant digits the two values agree exactly and the units match, making the answers equivalent.

• 7166.666… rounds to six significant digits as 7166.67 (the 7th digit is 6, so the 6th digit rounds up).

The two candidates give numerical answers in the same unit (percent).

Candidate 1: 0.249 %  → 0.249000 %
Candidate 2: 0.25 %   → 0.250000 %

Comparing to 6 significant digits: 0.249000 ≠ 0.250000.  
Therefore the answers are not the same.

The two candidates give numerical answers in joules.

Express both to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.3 ×10⁻¹⁸ J → 1.30000 ×10⁻¹⁸ J  
• Candidate 2: 1.28 ×10⁻¹⁸ J → 1.28000 ×10⁻¹⁸ J

Comparing 6‐digit mantissas: 1.30000 vs 1.28000 differ.  
Per Rule 4, values must match to 6 significant digits; they do not.

Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers express the vibrational frequency, but in different units:

• Candidate 1: 556 cm⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 1.67 × 10¹³ Hz

Conversion: ν (Hz) = (556 cm⁻¹)(2.997 924 58 × 10¹⁰ cm s⁻¹) ≈ 1.666 85 × 10¹³ Hz.

Expressing both to six significant digits:

• From Candidate 1: 1.66685 × 10¹³ Hz  
• Candidate 2:   1.67000 × 10¹³ Hz

These differ at the fourth significant digit, so they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

The two candidates give the result in different units (cm⁻¹ versus Hz), so we must convert one to the other.

556 cm⁻¹  →  wavenumber in m⁻¹ = 556 / 0.01 = 55 600 m⁻¹  
Frequency f = c · (wavenumber) = (2.997 924 58 × 10⁸ m·s⁻¹)(55 600 m⁻¹)  
      ≈ 1.666 85 × 10¹³ Hz

Candidate 2 gives 1.67 × 10¹³ Hz.  
Expressing both to six significant digits for the comparison required by Rule 4:

• from Candidate 1 (after conversion): 1.66685 × 10¹³ Hz  
• Candidate 2: 1.67000 × 10¹³ Hz  

Since 1.66685 × 10¹³ Hz and 1.67000 × 10¹³ Hz are different at the fourth significant digit, they do **not** match to six significant digits. Therefore, under Rule 4 the two answers are not considered equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a value of 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷ J per electron.

Candidate 2 gives 100 eV.  
Using the exact conversion 1 eV = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J, 100 eV = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁷ J.

Expressed with six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 → 1.60200 × 10⁻¹⁷ J  
• Candidate 2 → 1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁷ J

The two numbers differ at the 5th–6th significant digits, so by Rule 4 (require agreement to six significant digits) they are not considered the same. Hence the answers are inequivalent.
The two answers give the same physical quantity expressed in two different but directly convertible units.

• Candidate 1: 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷ J per electron.  
• Candidate 2: 100 eV.

Using the exact conversion 1 eV = 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J,

100 eV = 100 × 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J = 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁷ J,

which is the same value as Candidate 1 to the precision stated (Candidate 1 keeps only four significant digits). Therefore the two candidates are conveying the same numerical energy for a single electron that has been accelerated through 100 V.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two answers are expressed in different units, so first convert Candidate 2 to joules:

100 eV × 1 eV = 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
⇒ 100 eV = 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁷ J

Now write each value to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.60200 × 10⁻¹⁷ J  
• Candidate 2 (converted): 1.60218 × 10⁻¹⁷ J

Comparing digit by digit, they differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits.  
According to Rule 4, two numerical answers must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the length as

• Candidate 1: 2.534324263  
• Candidate 2: 2√2 sin(π/(2√2))

Evaluating Candidate 2 numerically:

π/(2√2) = π/√8 ≈ 1.11072073454  
sin(1.11072073454) ≈ 0.89601857  
2√2 ≈ 2.82842712475  

Hence 2√2 sin(π/(2√2)) ≈ 2.82842712475 × 0.89601857 ≈ 2.534324  (to six significant digits: 2.53432).

Candidate 1 rounded to six significant digits is also 2.53432.

Since the two results match to six significant digits and use the same units, the answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
### Reasoning:
Candidate 1 gives the numerical value  
 2.534324263.

Candidate 2 gives the expression  
 2√2 sin(π/(2√2)).

Evaluating the expression in Candidate 2:

π/(2√2) = π √2 / 4 ≈ 1.11072073450643  
sin(1.11072073450643) ≈ 0.896019119…  
2√2 ≈ 2.82842712474619  

Hence  
2√2 sin(π/(2√2)) ≈ 2.82842712474619 × 0.896019119 ≈ 2.53432444.

Rounding both results to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1: 2.53432  
• Candidate 2: 2.53432  

They match to six significant digits, so the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value: the height of the building, in metres.  

Candidate 1: 71 m  
Candidate 2: 71.1 m  

• Both answers are given in the same unit (metres), so no unit conversion is needed (Rule 1).  
• Compare to six significant digits (Rule 4):  
  – 71 m → 71.0000  
  – 71.1 m → 71.1000  

Since 71.0000 ≠ 71.1000, the two answers differ. Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

Both answers express a single numerical value for the oscillation frequency, but in different units.  
Converting Candidate 2’s value to angular frequency:

ω₂ = 2π f = 2π (0.436 Hz) ≈ 2.73947 rad s⁻¹.

Candidate 1 gives ω₁ = 2.74 rad s⁻¹, which corresponds (if converted) to  
f₁ = ω₁/(2π) ≈ 0.43618 Hz.

Comparing the angular frequencies to six significant digits:
ω₁ = 2.74000 rad s⁻¹  
ω₂ = 2.73947 rad s⁻¹  

They differ in the 4th significant digit (…4000 vs …3947), so by Rule 4 they are not considered the same. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give the same kind of quantity (frequency), but in different units.  
Converting Candidate 1 to hertz:  

f₁ = 2.74 rad s⁻¹ / (2π) ≈ 0.436085 Hz.

Candidate 2 states f₂ = 0.436 Hz, i.e. 0.436000 Hz to six significant digits.  

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):
0.436085 ≠ 0.436000.

Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives 2.74 rad s⁻¹ (angular frequency).  
Converting to ordinary frequency:  
f = ω / (2π) = 2.74 / 6.28318 ≈ 0.436084 Hz.

Candidate 2 gives 0.436 Hz, which we interpret as 0.436000 Hz.

Comparing the two values to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 0.436084  
• Candidate 2: 0.436000  

They differ at the 5th significant digit, so the two answers are not identical to six-digit precision. Hence, according to the guidelines, the predictions are not equivalent.

Comparing them to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 5275.00 m/s

Since 5275.00 ≠ 5196.00, the answers do not match.

Candidate 1 gives “−2 m,” explicitly stating the unit.  
Candidate 2 gives “−2,” omitting the unit, but in this context “meter” is the only reasonable unit (the problem already fixes meters for all distances), so the omission does not create ambiguity.  
Both specify the same numerical value, −2, so they are equivalent.

The question asks for two numerical answers.  
Both candidates provide values with the correct units for each sub-question, so direct numerical comparison applies.

Sub-answer (a):  
• Candidate 1: 3 × 10⁻⁶ W cm⁻²  
• Candidate 2: 8.7 × 10⁻¹⁰ W cm⁻²  
These differ by roughly 3.5 orders of magnitude → not equal (Rule 4).

Sub-answer (b):  
• Candidate 1: 7.5 × 10¹² photons cm⁻² s⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 2.4 × 10⁹ photons cm⁻² s⁻¹  
These differ by about a factor of 3000 → not equal (Rule 4).

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The problem asks for TWO separate results:

1. The factor by which the flux is increased in the image area.  
2. The focal length f (in terms of r and the sun’s angular diameter θ≈0.01 rad) that gives no increase in flux.

Candidate 1 supplies only a single inequality for part 2 (“f ≥ 100 r”) and gives nothing for part 1.

Candidate 2 supplies:
• Part 1: flux-increase factor = 4 r² / (θ² f²)  
• Part 2: f = 2 r / θ  (→ with θ ≈ 0.01 rad, f ≈ 200 r)

Thus:

• Candidate 1 omits the required flux-factor altogether (violating Rule 2).  
• Even on part 2, the conditions differ: “f ≥ 100 r” vs. “f = 200 r”. These are not the same statement.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates present the same essential prediction: the brightness (luminance) of the image produced by the lens is approximately equal to the brightness of the Sun’s surface.

• Candidate 1: “L ≈ L′” – In the context of the problem, L can be read as the surface brightness of the Sun and L′ as the brightness of the image, so the statement says the two are nearly equal.

• Candidate 2 explicitly states that the brightness of the lens image is “near that of the surface of the sun,” with a brief explanation.

Neither candidate supplies further numerical detail, units, or extra sub-answers, and both assert the same qualitative result. Hence their answers are equivalent.

Both sub-problems require answers.

(a) Surface equation  
• Candidate 1: z = ω² r² / (2 g)  
• Candidate 2: z = (ω² / 2 g) r²  
These are algebraically identical.

(b) Angular speed for f = 10 cm  
• Candidate 1: ω = 7 rad s⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: ω = √(g/(2 f)) ≈ 7.00 rad s⁻¹  
The explicit formula in Candidate 2 evaluates to 7.00 rad s⁻¹; this matches Candidate 1’s 7 rad s⁻¹ to at least six significant digits (7.00000).

Both candidates therefore give the same answers for both parts, with matching units and required quantity count.

The two candidates give different quantitative requirements for the telescope/optics.

• Candidate 1: needs either F/f ≥ 100 or an objective radius R ≥ 0.6 m (≈ 1.2 m diameter).

• Candidate 2: says the aperture must be a ≈ 2 λ / 10⁻⁶ → about 1 mm.

These numerical values differ by orders of magnitude, so the answers are not equivalent (Rule 4 on comparing numeric results).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives: 4000 Å (= 400 nm), 5000 Å (= 500 nm), 6670 Å (= 667 nm).  
Candidate 2 gives: 400 nm, 500 nm, 666.67 nm.

After converting Å → nm, the first two wavelengths coincide exactly (400 nm and 500 nm).  
For the third wavelength, Candidate 1’s value is 667 nm, which with six-significant-digit padding is 667.000 nm, while Candidate 2’s value is 666.670 nm.  The two numbers differ at the third significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not identical.  

Because at least one of the required sub-answers does not match, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply full Fresnel-coefficient sets ( r_s , t_s , r_p , t_p ) and Brewster’s law, so every sub-answer must coincide for the two candidates to be considered equivalent (Rule 2).

   • Candidate 2: r_s = (Z₂ cosθ₁ − Z₁ cosθ₂)/(Z₂ cosθ₁ + Z₁ cosθ₂)  
   Because Z ∝ 1/n, Candidate 2’s expression reduces algebraically to the same form as the usual n-based formula, and is therefore consistent with Candidate 1.  
   Likewise the two t_s formulas are equivalent.

2. p-polarization (r_p , t_p)  
   • Candidate 1: r_p = tan(θ₂−θ₁)/tan(θ₂+θ₁) (the standard result).  
   • Candidate 2: r_p = (Z₁ cosθ₂ − Z₂ cosθ₁)/(Z₁ cosθ₂ + Z₂ cosθ₁).

   Converting Candidate 2’s expression with Z ∝ 1/n gives  
   r_p = (n₂ cosθ₂ − n₁ cosθ₁)/(n₂ cosθ₂ + n₁ cosθ₁),  
   which is not the standard result and is not equivalent to Candidate 1’s tan-ratio form (nor to the correct impedance form, which would have Z₂ cosθ₁ − Z₁ cosθ₂ in the numerator). Numerical checks confirm they yield different values and even opposite sign.

3. Brewster angle  
   Both give tan θ_B = n₂/n₁, so this part matches.

Because the two candidates disagree on the p-polarization reflection (and consequently on the associated transmission), the overall answer sets are not the same. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The two answers are not the same.  

• Candidate 1 gives a transmitted intensity of (27 / 128) I₀ — an absolute intensity that is explicitly proportional to the incident intensity I₀.  
• Candidate 2 gives only the dimensionless fraction 27 / 128, omitting the factor I₀.

Because one answer includes the incident-intensity unit (I₀) and the other does not, the quantities are not directly identical and the omission creates an ambiguity (Rule 1). Hence the candidates are inequivalent.

The question asks for the specific wavelengths that are most intensified in the reflected light.  
Both candidates list four wavelengths (so the number of answers matches), but each wavelength must match across candidates.

Comparing each pair (order doesn’t matter, treat as sets) to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

1. 424 nm = 424.000 nm  
   423.53 nm = 423.530 nm → differs in the third significant digit.

2. 480 nm = 480.000 nm  
   480 nm = 480.000 nm → matches.

3. 554 nm = 554.000 nm  
   553.85 nm = 553.850 nm → differs in the third significant digit.

4. 655 nm = 655.000 nm  
   654.55 nm = 654.550 nm → differs in the third significant digit.

Since at least one corresponding value (actually three of them) fails to match to six significant digits, the two answer sets are not identical. According to Rule 4, this means the candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for three angles.  
Both candidates give three expressions, but Candidate 1 attaches a “±” sign to every result while Candidate 2 lists only the principal value (no “±”). Therefore Candidate 1 supplies two symmetric angles for each case, whereas Candidate 2 supplies only one. Because each corresponding sub-answer is not identical and does not cover the same set of values, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 lists two wavelengths: 6000 Å and 4285 Å.  
Candidate 2 lists two wavelengths: 6000 Å and 4285.714 Å.

Comparing each corresponding value to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• 6000 Å vs. 6000 Å → identical.  
• 4285.00 Å (interpreting the four-digit number 4285 as 4285.00 to six significant digits) vs. 4285.71 Å → differ in the fifth significant digit.

Since one of the required sub-answers does not match to six significant digits, the two candidates give different numerical results. Hence the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates must match on every sub-problem (a), (b), and (c).

• Part (a): both give x = ± d/√3 – they match here.

• Part (b): Candidate 2 supplies a verbal description of the magnetic-field line sketch; Candidate 1 gives no field-line answer at all. Because one candidate omits a required sub-answer, the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

• Part (c): although both imply simple-harmonic motion, equivalence is already broken by the mismatch in part (b).

Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts, so each candidate must give three corresponding answers ((a), (b), (c)) and those must match in content.

1. Sub-answer (a) – field in a good conductor  
   • Candidate 2 gives the standard skin-depth form with explicit decay constant  
     \(E=E_{0}e^{-\sqrt{\mu\sigma/2\omega}\,z}\,e^{\,i(\sqrt{\mu\sigma/2\omega}\,z-\omega t)}\).  
   • Candidate 1 writes \(E''_{y0}\approx 2\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_0\mu\omega}{\mu_0\sigma}}E_{y0} e^{-\alpha z}e^{i(\beta z-\omega t-\pi/4)}\) but never defines \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\). The prefactor  \(2\sqrt{\varepsilon_0\mu\omega/(\mu_0\sigma)}\) is also not the same constant as Candidate 2’s decay factor. Hence the two expressions are not the same.

2. Sub-answer (b) – dilute plasma  
   • Candidate 2 gives \(E=E_{0}e^{\,i\sqrt{\mu(\epsilon-ne^{2}/(m\omega^{2}))}\,z-\;i\omega t}\).  
   • Candidate 1 supplies transmission-coefficient-type formulas \(E''_{y0}=2E_{y0}/(1+\sqrt{1-\omega_{P}^{2}/\omega^{2}})\) (and an alternative with an \(i\)). These are not equivalent to Candidate 2’s travelling-wave expression.

3. Sub-answer (c) – comment on UV behaviour  
   Their qualitative statements differ (Candidate 1: “UV light can generally propagate”, Candidate 2: “metals remain highly reflective except above the plasma frequency, when they may become transparent”). They are not identical, though this alone would already make them different if the first two parts had matched.

Because the two candidates give different and/or incomplete formulas for parts (a) and (b) and differing comments for (c), the sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1:  
 j = − (4 ε₀ V₀)/(9 d²) √(2 e V₀ / m)  e_x  
 Magnitude ∝ (4 ε₀)/(9 d²) V₀^{3/2} √(2 e / m)

• Candidate 2:  
 J = (4 ε₀)/(9 d²) (2 e V₀ / m)^{3/2}  
 Magnitude ∝ (4 ε₀)/(9 d²) V₀^{3/2} (2 e / m)^{3/2}

Candidate 2 has an extra factor of (2 e / m) compared with Candidate 1 and lacks the negative sign and explicit direction. Hence, by Rule 1 and Rule 8, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single formula for the current density, so Rule 2 is satisfied.  
Comparing the expressions:

Candidate 1: j = − (4 ε₀ V₀)/(9 d²) · √(2 e V₀/m)  eₓ  
     = − (4 ε₀/9d²) (2 e/m)^{1/2} V₀^{3/2} eₓ

Candidate 2: J = (4 ε₀/9) (2 e V₀/m)^{3/2} (1/d²)  
     = (4 ε₀/9d²) (2 e/m)^{3/2} V₀^{3/2}

Relative factor: Candidate 2 has an extra (2 e/m) compared with Candidate 1, and Candidate 1 includes an overall negative sign and an explicit direction eₓ while Candidate 2 does not.

Because the magnitudes differ by the factor (2 e/m) and the signs/directions are not the same, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ.

Candidate 1:
j = − (4 ε₀ V₀)/(9 d²) √(2 e V₀ / m) eₓ  
  = − (4 ε₀)/(9 d²) √(2 e / m) V₀^{3/2} eₓ

Candidate 2:
J = (4 ε₀)/(9 d²) (2 e V₀ / m)^{3/2}  
  = (4 ε₀)/(9 d²) (2 e / m)^{3/2} V₀^{3/2}

Comparing the magnitudes:
Candidate 2 / Candidate 1 = (2 e / m)^{3/2} / (2 e / m)^{1/2} = (2 e / m).

Thus Candidate 2 is larger by the factor 2 e / m and also lacks the sign/vector direction. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates assert exactly the same set of field components:

• Candidate 1 explicitly lists each component and its value.
• Candidate 2 states that “the expressions … match the given forms,” i.e. the very same formulas written in the prompt (which are the ones Candidate 1 reproduces).

No disagreement or additional/omitted term appears. Hence the two answers convey the same information.

Both candidates give two formulas (for parts (a) and (b)), so they match in number of sub-answers.  
Compare the expressions term by term:

Second (image-charge) term inside the brackets

• Candidate 1: | r – (a²/s) s |  
• Candidate 2: | r – (a²/s²) s |

That is, Candidate 1 multiplies the vector s by a factor a²/s, whereas Candidate 2 multiplies it by a²/s². These differ by a factor of 1/s; they cannot be algebraically identical.

Since at least one component of each sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The question asks for two distinct expressions, (a) and (b).  
Comparing each sub-answer:

Sub-answer (a)  
• Candidate 1 coefficient of the image term: (a / s) and image position (a²/s) s.  
• Candidate 2 coefficient: (a²/|s|²) and image position (a²/|s|²) s.  
These differ (different power of a/s and different location).

Sub-answer (b)  
• Candidate 1 again uses coefficient (a / s) and position (a²/s) s.  
• Candidate 2 uses the same coefficient (a/|s|) but position (a²/|s|²) s.  
The positions differ.

Since at least one required part of each sub-answer does not match, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for two expressions:  

(a) the potential in vacuum,  
(b) the potential when the outside region is a dielectric.

Both candidates supply two formulas, so the count of sub-answers matches.

Compare the formulas term-by-term.

Notation:
• q, a, s (=| s |), r are common.  
• Denominators:  
 Candidate 1 uses | r − (a²/s) s |.  
 Candidate 2 uses | r − (a²/s²) s |.  
Since (a²/s²) s = (a²/s) ŝ, these two vectors are identical, so the denominator locations coincide.

• Numerators of the second (image-charge) term:  
 Candidate 1: q (a/s)  
 Candidate 2: q a²/s²  

These differ by a factor a/s (except in the special case a = s). Therefore the magnitudes of the image charges — and hence the whole potentials — are different.

Because the expressions for part (a) are different, and the same mismatch propagates to part (b) (the only change there is ε₀→ε), the two sets of answers are not mathematically equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 4 π K V² / [ln(b/a)]²

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both supply the required conservation‐of‐momentum and conservation‐of‐energy equations (part (a)), but for part (b) they give different scattered-photon energies:

• Candidate 1:  h ν′ = h ν / (1 + 2h ν / m c²)  
• Candidate 2:  h ν′ = m c² / 2

Since these expressions are not equal in general, the two candidates’ overall answers are not identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has two sub-parts:  
(a) give the conservation equations (momentum x- and y-components and energy) and  
(b) give the scattered photon energy for 180° back-scattering under the stated assumption.

Comparison of the two candidates:

Sub-part (a):  
Both candidates supply the x- and y-momentum equations and the energy equation in equivalent form, so they match here.

Sub-part (b):  
• Candidate 1: \(E' = \dfrac{E}{1+ 2E/(m c^{2})}\).  
• Candidate 2: \(E' = \dfrac{m c^{2}}{2}\).

These are not the same formula.  Candidate 2’s result is a constant independent of the incident photon energy, whereas Candidate 1’s result depends on the incident energy.  The two expressions coincide only in the extreme limit \(E \gg m c^{2}\); outside that limit they differ, and the problem statement does not specify an explicit “infinite-energy” limit—only that the electron is “approximately” at light speed, which still allows moderate relativistic energies where the two formulas disagree.  

Because the answers to sub-part (b) are not identical, the two candidates are not equivalent overall (Rule 2).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give answers for the two required regions (inside and outside), but their formulas for the outside field are not the same.

1. Inside the sphere  
   Both give  
   E_inside = (3 ε₂)/(ε₁ + 2 ε₂) E.  
   → identical.

2. Outside the sphere  
   • Candidate 1:  
     E_out = E + (ε₁ − ε₂)/(ε₁ + 2 ε₂) a³ [3(E·r) r / r⁵ − E / r³].

   • Candidate 2:  
     E_out = E + (1/(4π ε₂))·[3(ε₁ − ε₂) ε₂ a³ /(ε₁ + 2 ε₂) r³]·(3 cos θ r̂ − sin θ θ̂).

   Differences:  
   – Candidate 2’s dipole term lacks the factor of the original field magnitude E.  
   – Its angular dependence (3 cos θ r̂ − sin θ θ̂) differs from the correct (2 cos θ r̂ + sin θ θ̂) that follows from Candidate 1’s expression.  
   Therefore the two expressions are not algebraically equivalent.

Since the outside‐field results disagree, the overall answers are not equivalent.

4. Magnetic-field direction: “z” and “+z” both indicate the +z axis (the natural reading of “z direction”).

All corresponding answers match.

The question has four parts.  
For part (a) the candidate must give Maxwell’s four equations and explicitly state the system of units.

• Candidate 2 supplies the equations (with μ0 ε0 term) and explicitly writes “System of units: SI”.

• Candidate 1 supplies the same equations (the 1/c² factor equals μ0 ε0 so the equations themselves match) but never states the system of units.

Thus Candidate 1 omits an explicitly‐requested item, whereas Candidate 2 supplies it.  According to Rule 2/Rule 1, omission of a required component makes the answers inequivalent.

For the other parts (b)–(d) both candidates give identical transformations, but the mismatch in part (a) is enough to make the overall sets of answers different.

Therefore the two candidates’ predictions are NOT equivalent.

Both candidates answer all three sub-problems, so we must compare each item.

(a) Electric field  
• Candidate 1:  
 E = −B₀ e^{ax} sin w êₓ  − (a c/ω) B₀ e^{ax} cos w ê_y  
• Candidate 2:  
 E = −B₀ e^{ax}/√(k² − a²) [ k sin w êₓ + a cos w ê_y ]

The two expressions differ in their coefficients of both êₓ and ê_y unless a=0 (a generic non-zero a is allowed by the problem). Hence the electric-field results are not the same.

(b) Propagation speed  
• Candidate 1: v = c  
• Candidate 2: v = c √(1 − a²/k²)

These differ except when a = 0.

(c) Possibility of generating the field  
The statements are plainly different (Candidate 1 gives a cryptic extra expression, Candidate 2 states a dispersion relation).

Since at least one sub-answer in each part disagrees, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give two answers as required, but they differ for part (a):

• Candidate 1:  \(E = \dfrac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}\,\mathbf{a}\)  (explicitly a vector in the direction of \(\mathbf{a}\)).  
• Candidate 2:  \(E = \dfrac{\rho a}{3\varepsilon_0}\)  (just a scalar; no direction given).

Since the electric field is a vector quantity, omitting the direction makes Candidate 2’s answer incomplete and therefore not equivalent to Candidate 1’s.  
For part (b) both expressions are identical, but the discrepancy in part (a) means the overall answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both sub-parts must match.

(a)  Candidate 1 gives the vector field  
  E = (ρ/3ε₀) 𝐚 (direction specified).  
  Candidate 2 gives E = ρa/(3ε₀) with no vector notation, i.e. only the magnitude.  
  Vector versus scalar → not identical.

(b)  The two expressions for the potential are algebraically the same, but equivalence for the whole problem requires both sub-answers to match.

Since part (a) differs, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 does NOT actually supply the electric-field expressions requested in part (a); it only says “Refer to Problem 1013.”  
Candidate 2 gives explicit formulas for the electric field both inside and outside the sphere.  

Because the problem requires answers for both parts (a) and (b), and Candidate 1 omits the electric-field result while Candidate 2 provides it, the two responses are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical results:

• Candidate 1:  \( \dfrac{q^{2}}{8\pi\varepsilon_{0}}\left(\dfrac{1}{R}-\dfrac{1}{R+t}\right)\)  (generally a positive, non-zero quantity for finite \(R,t>0\))  
• Candidate 2:  0

Since a non-zero expression is not equal to zero (they differ already in the first significant digit), the answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for two distinct answers: 
(a) the required radius \(R\),
(b) the force \(F\) with that radius when the sphere is charged to potential \(V\).

Candidate 1:
(a) \(R = d/8\)  
(b) \(F = QV/(8d)\)

Candidate 2:
(a) \(R = d\)  
(b) \(F = kQ^2/(4d^2) + kQ(4\pi\varepsilon_0RV)/(4d^2)\)

For part (a) the radii differ (\(d/8\) versus \(d\)); they are clearly not the same quantity. Since at least one required sub-answer disagrees, the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ only by the standard Gaussian–to–SI conversion factor that accompanies the charge \(e\):

In Gaussian units \(e_{\text{cgs}}^{2}=e_{\text{SI}}^{2}/(4\pi\varepsilon_{0})\Rightarrow
e_{\text{cgs}}^{4}=e_{\text{SI}}^{4}/(16\pi^{2}\varepsilon_{0}^{2}).\)

Substituting this into Candidate 1,

\(T=\dfrac{m^{2}c^{3}a_{0}^{3}}{4e_{\text{cgs}}^{4}}
     =\frac{m^{2}c^{3}a_{0}^{3}}{4}\,
       \frac{16\pi^{2}\varepsilon_{0}^{2}}{e_{\text{SI}}^{4}}
     =\frac{4\pi^{2}\varepsilon_{0}^{2}c^{3}m^{2}a_{0}^{3}}{e_{\text{SI}}^{4}},\)

which is exactly Candidate 2. Thus, once the unit systems are reconciled, the two answers are the same.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

Both answers give a single formula for the decay time.

Candidate 1: T₁ = m² c³ a₀³ /(4 e⁴)       (no ε₀ or π shown → Gaussian units)

Candidate 2: T₂ = 4 π² ε₀² m² c³ a₀³ / e⁴   (explicit SI units)

Convert Candidate 1 to SI units.  In Gaussian units

 e_cgs = e_SI /√(4 π ε₀)  ⇒ e_cgs⁴ = e_SI⁴ /(4 π ε₀)².

Hence

 T₁ = m² c³ a₀³ /[4 e_cgs⁴]
    = m² c³ a₀³ /(4 · e_SI⁴ /(4 π ε₀)²)
    = 4 π² ε₀² m² c³ a₀³ / e_SI⁴.

This is exactly Candidate 2’s expression.  After accounting for the different unit systems, the two formulas are identical.

Both candidates give piece-wise expressions for

• electric field E  
• magnetic field B  
• energy density u (or w)  
• momentum density g  

1. Electric field:  
 Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are identical after identifying λ = q ⁄ l; directions match.

2. Magnetic field:  
 Using μ₀ = 1/(ε₀c²), the two B–expressions are also identical.

3. Energy density:  
 For r>R (and similarly for r<R)

 Candidate 1: u₁ = λ²(1+v²/c²)/(8π² ε₀ r²)  
 Candidate 2: u₂ = λ²(1/ε₀ + μ₀v²)/(8π² ε₀ r²)  
       = λ²(1+v²/c²)/(8π² ε₀² r²)         (after μ₀→1/ε₀c²)

 u₂ differs from u₁ by an extra factor 1/ε₀, so the two are not equivalent.

4. Momentum density:  
 Candidate 1: g₁ = λ² v² /(4π² ε₀ c² r²) ẑ  
 Candidate 2: g₂ = μ₀ λ² v /(4π² r²) ẑ  
       = λ² v /(4π² ε₀ c² r²) ẑ

 g₁ has an extra factor v compared with g₂, hence they disagree.

Because they disagree on both energy density and momentum density, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give identical expressions for  
(a) the electric field E and  
(b) the magnetic field B.

For (c) the energy density, Candidate 2 states the standard formula  
u = ½(ε₀E² + B²/μ₀) “with E and B as above,” which, when the earlier E and B are substituted, reproduces Candidate 1’s explicit piece-wise expression, so these are compatible.

For (d) the momentum density g, however, the two answers differ fundamentally:

• Candidate 1: g ∝ v² (q²)/(ε₀c² …) ẑ  
• Candidate 2: g ∝ v  (q²)/(ε₀c² …) ẑ   (and with opposite sign)

Because the dependence on v (v vs v²) and even the sign are not the same, the momentum-density results are not equivalent. Since at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different multiplicative factors for the new capacitance.

• Candidate 1: C′ = ((ε + ε₀)/(2 ε₀)) C  
  → if ε = εᵣ ε₀, this factor becomes (εᵣ+1)/2.

• Candidate 2: C′ = (2 ε)/(1 + ε) C  
  → if ε = εᵣ (relative permittivity), the factor is 2 εᵣ/(1+εᵣ); if ε = εᵣ ε₀ (absolute), the factor is 2 εᵣ ε₀/(1+εᵣ ε₀).

Under neither interpretation does  (εᵣ+1)/2 equal 2 εᵣ/(1+εᵣ), nor does (ε+ε₀)/(2 ε₀) equal 2 ε/(1+ε) for absolute permittivity. Hence the expressions are not algebraically equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions multiply the original capacitance C by different factors:  

• Candidate 1 multiplies by ½(ε/ε₀ + 1).  
• Candidate 2 multiplies by 2ε/(ε + 1) (with ε appearing without ε₀).

Even if ε in Candidate 1 is interpreted as an absolute permittivity and in Candidate 2 as a relative permittivity (or vice-versa), the two factors are not algebraically the same except in the trivial case ε = ε₀ (no dielectric). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two sets of answers are not the same.

• Part (a): Candidate 1 has the mirror focal length +21 m, Candidate 2 gives −21 m.  
• Part (b): Candidate 1 lists only “three stages,” while Candidate 2 also states the direction of incidence for each stage (a required item).  
• Part (c): Their image distances and magnifications for stages 2 and 3 differ (16.8 m vs −16.8 m, 12 m vs −28 m, etc.).  
• Part (d): Final image positions (12 m left vs 28 m left) and total magnifications (−1/7 vs −1/3) are different.

Because multiple required sub-answers disagree or are missing, the predictions are inequivalent.

The two candidates do not give the same answers.

Sub-problem (a)  
• Candidate 1 supplies a full vector field with non-zero Ex, Ey, Ez and writes the dispersion relation  
  ω² = [k_z² + (mπ/a)² + (nπ/b)²] c².  
• Candidate 2 gives only a single-component TE field (Ey only) and writes  
  k_z² = ω² − [(mπ/a)² + (nπ/b)²], i.e. it lacks the factor c² that Candidate 1 keeps explicitly.  
The two field expressions are not the same and the dispersion relations are not algebraically identical unless one silently sets c = 1, which is not stated.

Because the answers for part (a) already differ, the overall sets of answers are not identical.  
(Parts (b) and (c) also show differences in the explicit formulas, but the inequivalence is already clear from part (a).)

Therefore the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: I(t) = −q ω sin ωt  (signed, changes sign with time)

These are not the same function of time; taking an absolute value removes the sign information. Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question lists all answer choices in seconds, so the unit is clearly “second.”  

• Candidate 1: “10^{-6}” – gives the value but omits the (implicit) unit.  
• Candidate 2: “10^{-6} second” – gives the same value and explicitly states the unit.

Because the only reasonable unit in the context of this multiple-choice question is seconds, the omission of the word “second” in Candidate 1 does not introduce ambiguity. Both candidates refer to the same quantity, 1 × 10⁻⁶ s.

Both candidates give the semi-empirical mass-formula with the same five contributions:

1. volume term ∝ A  
2. surface term ∝ A^{2/3}  
3. Coulomb term ∝ Z² A^{–1/3}  
4. asymmetry term ∝ ( A–2Z )² / A (candidate 2) or (A/2–Z)²/A (candidate 1: identical up to the undefined coefficient)  
5. pairing term: candidate 1 writes it explicitly as a_p δ A^{–1/2}; candidate 2 folds the same factor into the symbol δ(A,Z). Because all coefficients (and any A–dependence inside δ) are left unspecified in both answers, this difference is purely notational.

No required term is missing from either formula, and no extra term is present. Thus the two formulas convey the same content.

The question asks for two distinct items:  
1) the required energy (a numerical value),  
2) whether Earth’s magnetic field is strong enough (a yes/no judgment).

Sub-answer #1 (energy):
• Candidate 1: 6.7 × 10⁶ MeV  
• Candidate 2: 6.68 × 10⁶ MeV  
These values coincide to six significant digits, so they are equivalent for sub-answer #1.

Sub-answer #2 (adequacy of Earth’s field):
• Candidate 1 gives a required field strength, 3.49 × 10⁻³ T ≈ 35 G, but does not explicitly answer “yes” or “no.”  
  (Moreover, 35 G is far above Earth’s ~0.5 G field, so the implied answer would be “No.”)  
• Candidate 2 explicitly answers “Yes.”  

The two candidates therefore give different or incompatible responses for the second part.  
Under Rule 2 (all requested sub-answers must match), the overall answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for six distinct answers (parts a–f).  
Both candidates supply six answers, so compare each corresponding pair.

Part (b):  
• Candidate 1: 1.18 × 10⁻²⁵ cm²/sr  
• Candidate 2: 4.4 × 10⁻²⁵ cm²/sr  

Expressed with the same exponent (10⁻²⁵), the significant figures are

– Candidate 1: 1.18000  
– Candidate 2: 4.40000  

They differ already in the first significant digit, so they are not equal to 6-significant-digit precision (Rule 4).  
Because at least one of the sub-answers differs, the whole answer sets are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a decay rate of 1.19 × 10⁷ s⁻¹.  
Candidate 2 gives a lifetime of 8.3 × 10⁻⁸ s.

Because lifetime (τ) and decay rate (Γ) are reciprocals (Γ = 1/τ), we convert Candidate 2’s value:

1 / (8.3 × 10⁻⁸ s) ≈ 1.20482 × 10⁷ s⁻¹.

Comparing the two rates to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 1.19000 × 10⁷ s⁻¹  
• Candidate 2 (converted): 1.20482 × 10⁷ s⁻¹

They differ in the third significant digit, so they do not match to the required 6-digit precision. Moreover, Candidate 2 originally reports a different physical quantity (lifetime instead of rate).

We check each sub-answer.

(a) L: C1 gives 1, C2 gives 1 → same.  
(b) S: C1 gives 1, C2 gives 1 → same.  
(c) Probability: C1 gives 0, C2 gives 0 → same.  
(d) Angular dependence:  
 • C1: \( \dfrac{dP}{d\Omega}= \dfrac{3}{8\pi}\sin^{2}\theta\).  
 • C2: \( \sin^{2}\theta\).

These differ by the multiplicative factor \(3/(8\pi)\). The question asks for the probability per unit solid angle, so the overall normalization is part of the desired expression. Because the two expressions are not identical, the answers to part (d) are different.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  

Eₖ = [m_K² – m_π² + (m_Λ – m_p)²] / [2 (m_Λ – m_p)]

Candidate 2 gives  

Eₖ = [m_Λ² + m_p² + m_K² – m_π² – 2 m_Λ m_p] / [2 (m_Λ – m_p)] c²

Algebraically the two numerators are identical, since  

m_Λ² + m_p² – 2 m_Λ m_p = (m_Λ – m_p)².

Thus, apart from the explicit factor c² in Candidate 2, the two expressions are the same.

However, Candidate 2 multiplies by c² (giving the answer in energy units), whereas Candidate 1 omits this factor and hence is expressed in mass units.  Because the question asks for an energy and does not state that natural units (c = 1) should be used, the omission of c² in Candidate 1 creates an ambiguity of units.  According to Rule 1, differing units without an explicit, justified conversion makes the answers inequivalent.

The problem requests two answers:
(a) β = v/c (dimensionless)  
(b) the rest energy of the mesons (an energy, e.g., in MeV).

Candidate 1  
• answer 1: 1/3  
• answer 2: 136 MeV/c²  ← unit of mass, not energy

Candidate 2  
• answer 1: 1/3  
• answer 2: 136 MeV  ← unit of energy

For part (a) both candidates agree.  
For part (b) the numerical value matches but the units differ: “MeV/c²” (mass) vs “MeV” (energy). Because the question explicitly asks for an energy, these two responses are of different physical quantities. Per Rule 1, differing units that cannot be converted directly for the required quantity make the answers inequivalent.

Hence the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same formula for the photon energy in part (a), but:

• Part (b):  
  – Candidate 1 supplies only the numerical energy (≈ 25 eV) and omits the required spectral regime.  
  – Candidate 2 gives the same energy and explicitly states the regime (“extreme ultraviolet”).  
  → The answers differ; Candidate 1 is incomplete.

• Part (c):  
  – Candidate 1 says most photons would already have been produced so direct detection is unlikely.  
  – Candidate 2 says the photon energy would be lowered by cosmological red-shift but otherwise unchanged.  
  → Qualitatively different predictions.

Because at least one required piece of information differs or is missing and the qualitative statements conflict, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single quantitative estimate (magnitude of the error or accuracy).  
• Candidate 1 gives: “ΔV ≈ 1 × 10⁻⁹.”  
• Candidate 2 gives: “error on the order of 10⁻¹¹.”

Both candidates provide one numerical estimate (same type, no explicit units), so we compare the numbers.  
10⁻⁹ and 10⁻¹¹ differ by two orders of magnitude and therefore are not equal to six significant digits (Rule 4). Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates: 

Sub-problem (a): Each lists the same three antisymmetrised two-electron spatial states ψ₁₂, ψ₁₃, ψ₂₃ (same formulas and normalisation).

Sub-problem (b): Candidate 1 writes the required matrix–element expression explicitly; Candidate 2 states that one obtains “the given expression” by the usual expansion. Although Candidate 2 does not rewrite the formula, it explicitly claims the same final result. No contradictory or additional different expression is supplied.

Hence the two answers contain the same essential content for both parts (a) and (b); neither omits something the other includes that changes the answer.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates coincide for part (a): both list the same three antisymmetrized two-electron wave-functions ψ₁₂, ψ₁₃ and ψ₂₃.  

For part (b) they differ:

• Candidate 1 gives one matrix-element expression containing a subtraction:
⟨ψ₃ψ₁|V'|ψ₂ψ₁⟩  –  ⟨ψ₁ψ₃|V'|ψ₂ψ₁⟩.

• Candidate 2 lists the two inner products as separate “answers” with no minus sign or other relation between them.

Because the required single expression involves the difference of the two integrals, omitting the minus sign changes the result. Thus the two candidates’ answers for part (b) are not the same, so the overall answers are not equivalent.

The two answers differ only in whether they write the harmonic-oscillator constant as \(k\) or as \(m\omega^{2}\).  
Since for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator \(k = m\omega^{2}\), the denominators \(2m\omega^{2}\) and \(2k\) are identical.  
Thus

\[
-\frac{q^{2}E^{2}}{2m\omega^{2}} \;=\; -\frac{q^{2}E^{2}}{2k}.
\]

Therefore the two candidates give the same energy shift.

The question implicitly requires giving an expression for every total-angular-momentum state that has magnetic quantum number m = l – ½.  For a fixed orbital l this includes two states:

• j = l + ½, m = l – ½  
• j = l – ½, m = l – ½

Candidate 1 supplies formulas for both of these states.  
Candidate 2 supplies a (phase-equivalent) formula only for the second state and omits the first state entirely.

Because the required set contains two states and Candidate 2 provides only one of them, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates supply two items—the full energy spectrum and the corresponding eigen‐states—so we compare each item.

1. Energy levels  
   • C1:  E₀ + 2W cos(2πj/N)  
   • C2:  E₀ + 2W cos(2πk/N)

   Same formula (dummy index difference only). ✓

2. Wave-functions  
   • C1:  |E_j⟩ = (1/√N) Σ_{n=1}^{N} e^{+i 2πj(n-1)/N}|n⟩  
   • C2:  ψ_k(n) = (1/√N) e^{−i 2πk(n-1)/N}

   C2’s state is the complex conjugate of C1’s with the same index, i.e. it equals C1’s state with k→−k (or equivalently k→N−j under the periodic lattice). Since ±k (mod N) label the same eigen‐value and belong to the same eigenspace, both answers give the same complete set of eigenvectors up to an allowed sign convention. Therefore the wave-functions are physically and mathematically equivalent.

Because both sub-answers match, the two candidates are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give two required items:  

1. Energy spectrum: E₀ + 2W cos(2π j/N)  vs.  E₀ + 2W cos(2π m/N) – identical (just different symbol for the integer quantum number).

2. Eigenvectors:  
   • Candidate 1: (1/√N) ∑ₙ e^{ i(n−1)2πj/N}|n⟩  
   • Candidate 2: (1/√N) ∑ₙ e^{−i 2πmn/N}|n⟩  

The two expressions differ only by:  
   – a sign in the exponent (can be absorbed by choosing m = −j mod N, which leaves the energy unchanged because cos is even), and  
   – a constant phase factor (the “−1” shift in n or an overall e^{±i2πj/N}), which does not change the physical state.

Thus the two wave-functions represent the same eigenstates up to an irrelevant overall phase and relabelling of the momentum quantum number. Since both sub-answers are equivalent, the candidates’ predictions are equivalent.

The question requires two numerical answers.  
Both candidates give two answers, but their first answers differ:

• Candidate 1: 0.702000 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 512/729 ≈ 0.702331 (to six significant digits)

Since 0.702000 ≠ 0.702331 at six-digit precision, the first answers are not the same, violating Rule 4.  
Therefore the candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-problems, so each candidate must supply three corresponding answers that match numerically (Rule 2).

Sub-answer (a):  
• Candidate 1: 0.41 × 10⁻¹⁷ m = 4.10 × 10⁻¹⁸ m  
• Candidate 2: 5.75 × 10⁻¹⁷ m = 5.75 × 10⁻¹⁷ m  
Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4) these differ by more than an order of magnitude, so they are not equal.

Sub-answer (b): both say the tunnelling probability is “≈ 0,” which would agree, but that cannot rescue inequivalence in (a).

Sub-answer (c):  
• Candidate 1 gives two diffraction angles (in radians).  
• Candidate 2 gives a de Broglie wavelength (in metres).  
These are different physical quantities, hence not directly comparable (Rule 1/Rule 6).

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 2:  σ₀ = (4π / k²) · sin²(kR)

Apart from a different symbol for the cross-section (σ_t vs. σ₀), the mathematical expressions are identical. Therefore the answers are equivalent.

The question has four separate sub-parts, each requiring a specific answer.

Sub-part (a):  
• Candidate 1 gives the delta–function jump conditions  
  ψ(a⁺) − ψ(a⁻)=0, ψ′(a⁺) − ψ′(a⁻)=2Ω ψ(a).  
• Candidate 2 gives Bloch’s condition ψ(x+a)=e^{ika}ψ(x).  
These are clearly different boundary conditions.

Since the two candidates already disagree on sub-part (a), the full sets of answers cannot be identical (Rule 2). Therefore the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas.

Candidate 1:  (A² m² e²)/(9 ħ⁴)

Candidate 2:  (e² A² m²)/(8 π² ε₀² ħ⁴)

• Candidate 2 contains the factor ε₀ (SI units) while Candidate 1 does not (Gaussian or natural units), so the units are not expressed in the same system.

• Even after trying to convert between systems, the numerical prefactors (1/9 vs 1/8π²) and the powers of ε₀ do not match.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
The two expressions differ by more than just a unit-system conversion.

• Converting Candidate 1 from Gaussian to SI would multiply its denominator by \((4\pi\varepsilon_0)^2\), giving  
\[
\frac{A^{2}m^{2}e^{2}}{9(4\pi\varepsilon_0)^2\hbar^{4}}
=\frac{A^{2}m^{2}e^{2}}{9\cdot16\pi^{2}\varepsilon_{0}^{2}\hbar^{4}} .
\]

• Candidate 2 is  
\[
\frac{A^{2}m^{2}e^{2}}{16\pi^{2}\varepsilon_{0}^{2}\hbar^{4}} .
\]

After putting them in the same units, they still differ by a factor of 9 in the denominator. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The question has two sub-parts.

1. Part (a) asks for the free-particle Green’s function.
2. Part (b) asks for
   • an integral equation,
   • the reflection probability in the first Born approximation,
   • and the energy range where the approximation is good.

Candidate 1  
– Gives the Green’s-function formula for part (a).  
– Supplies a reflection probability \(R=\frac{m^{2}V_{0}^{2}}{\hbar^{4}k^{4}}\sin^{2}(ka)\).  
– Does **not** state the energy range (and gives no integral equation).

Candidate 2  
– Does **not** provide the Green’s-function formula for part (a).  
– Gives a reflection probability \(\left(\tfrac{V_{0}}{2E}\right)^{2}\sin^{2}(ka)\) and states the energy condition “\(E\gg V_{0}\)” (still missing the integral equation).

Although the two reflections look different, they are algebraically identical:
\[
\frac{m^{2}V_0^{2}}{\hbar^{4}k^{4}}\sin^{2}(ka)=
\left(\frac{V_{0}}{2E}\right)^{2}\sin^{2}(ka),
\]
because \(k^{2}=2mE/\hbar^{2}\).  
However, the answers are **not equivalent overall**:

• Candidate 1 answers part (a) but omits the energy range requested in part (b).  
• Candidate 2 omits part (a) entirely and also omits the integral equation.

Since each candidate leaves out different required pieces, their outputs are not the same set of answers.

The question asks for two separate things:  
(a) the time-dependent state |ψ(t)⟩ expressed in the {|+⟩,|−⟩} basis, and  
(b) the three time-dependent expectation values ⟨s_x⟩, ⟨s_y⟩, ⟨s_z⟩.

Candidate 1 supplies:  
• a state vector |ψ(t)⟩ = cos(½γBt)|+⟩ – sin(½γBt)|−⟩,  
• ⟨s_z⟩ = (ħ/2) cos(γBt),  
• ⟨s_y⟩ = 0,  
• ⟨s_x⟩ = –(ħ/2) sin(γBt).

Candidate 2 gives only three quantities: “0”, “−ħ/2 sin(γBt)”, “ħ/2”.  No state vector is provided, so part (a) is missing.  Interpreting the three numbers as the expectations for s_x, s_y, s_z yields:

⟨s_x⟩ = 0, ⟨s_y⟩ = −(ħ/2) sin(γBt), ⟨s_z⟩ = ħ/2,

which are clearly different from Candidate 1’s results, and again leave out the required state vector.

Because Candidate 2 omits one full required answer and disagrees with Candidate 1 on the remaining answers, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for

1. the quantum‐mechanical relation  
   |ψ(0)|² = (m/2π)⟨dV/dr⟩ – (1/2π)⟨L²/r³⟩
2. a classical interpretation for the L≠0 case.

Comparison:

Candidate 2
• States the required equation.  
• Gives the classical interpretation (“for non-zero angular momentum the particle cannot be at the origin, so |ψ(0)|² = 0 and the two expectation terms balance – classical force equilibrium”).

Candidate 1  
• Gives the same equation (answer 1).  
• Adds two further equalities (answers 2 and 3) asserting ⟨dV/dr⟩ = (1/m)⟨L²/r³⟩ and dV/dr = L²/(mr³). These go beyond what the problem asks and are generally not true except in special circumstances.  
• Supplies no classical interpretation.

Because the candidates differ on the second required item (Candidate 2 provides it, Candidate 1 does not) and Candidate 1 introduces extra, potentially incorrect statements, the two answers are not equivalent under Rule 2 (different completeness) and Rule 8 (extra, wrong content).

The two candidates give different expressions.

• Candidate 2 presents a general formula that depends on the unspecified initial wave-function ψ₀(x).

• Candidate 1 gives a specific closed-form expression with a Gaussian width parameter a, which corresponds only to a particular ψ₀(x).

Since Candidate 1 is just one special case of Candidate 2 (and only if ψ₀ is that particular Gaussian), while the problem statement does not restrict ψ₀ to that form, the answers are not the same.

The two candidates give different inequalities.

Candidate 1:  
((1 − ηℓ)/(1 + ηℓ)) σ_inel ≤ σ_elastic ≤ ((1 + ηℓ)/(1 − ηℓ)) σ_inel.

Candidate 2:  
0 ≤ σ_elastic ≤ σ_inelastic.

Except for the special (and nongeneric) case ηℓ = 0, the ranges do not coincide: the lower bound of Candidate 1 is generally positive and the upper bound can exceed σ_inelastic, whereas Candidate 2 fixes the upper bound at σ_inelastic and allows the lower bound to be zero. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The question only requires the differential cross-section “up to a multiplicative constant.”  
Both candidates give the same θ-dependence:

• Candidate 1:  σ(θ) ∝ e^{-q²a²/2}, with q = 2k sin(θ/2).  
• Candidate 2:  σ(θ) ∝ e^{-2k²a² sin²(θ/2)}.

Since q² = 4k² sin²(θ/2), the two exponentials are identical:

e^{-q²a²/2} = e^{-(4k² sin²(θ/2)) a²/2} = e^{-2k²a² sin²(θ/2)}.

The difference is only an overall constant prefactor, which the problem statement explicitly allows to be ignored. Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same functional dependence on the scattering variables:

• Outside factor: Candidate 1 has 4 μ²V₀²/ħ⁴, Candidate 2 has 4 m²V₀²/ħ⁴.  
 For a nucleon scattered from a “heavy” (effectively infinite-mass) nucleus, the reduced mass μ equals the nucleon mass m to the required accuracy. Hence μ and m are interchangeable in this context.

• Denominator: (2k sin (θ/2))⁶ in Candidate 1 is identical to Δ⁶ with Δ = 2k sin (θ/2) in Candidate 2.

• Numerator: Both have [sin(2kR sin (θ/2)) − 2kR sin (θ/2) cos(2kR sin (θ/2))]².

Therefore, after the identification μ ≈ m appropriate for the problem statement, the two expressions are the same.
Both candidates give the same functional form

dσ/dΩ  ∝  V0²  ×  [ sin(ΔR) – ΔR cos(ΔR) ]² / Δ⁶ ,

with  
Δ = 2k sin(θ/2).

Writing this explicitly,

Candidate 1: (4 μ² V0² / ħ⁴) [ sin(ΔR) – ΔR cos(ΔR) ]² / (Δ)⁶  
Candidate 2: (2 m V0 / ħ²)² [ sin(ΔR) – ΔR cos(ΔR) ]² / (Δ)⁶ .

The algebraic factors are identical:

• (2 m V0/ħ²)² = 4 m² V0²/ħ⁴, matching 4 μ² V0²/ħ⁴ if the mass symbol differs only in name (nucleon mass vs. reduced mass; for a heavy target they are equal).  
• Both have the same Δ = 2k sin(θ/2) appearing to the sixth power in the denominator.  
• The numerators are identical once Δ is substituted.

No additional terms or differing powers appear. Thus the two expressions are the same up to notation.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same angular dependence and the same squared bracket factor.  

Compare the overall prefactors:

Candidate 1  
 4 μ² V₀² / [ ħ⁴ (2k sin (θ/2))⁶ ]  
 = 4 μ² V₀² / [ ħ⁴ 2⁶ k⁶ sin⁶(θ/2) ]  
 = (4/64) μ² V₀² / [ ħ⁴ k⁶ sin⁶(θ/2) ]  
 = (1/16) μ² V₀² / [ ħ⁴ k⁶ sin⁶(θ/2) ].

Candidate 2  
 m² V₀² / [ 16 ħ⁴ k⁶ sin⁶(θ/2) ].

Thus the two expressions are identical if one identifies m with μ (the nucleon mass / reduced mass), which is merely a notation change; no numerical factor differs. All other parts of the formula match exactly.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.
The two candidates give

Candidate 1:
σ(θ)= (4 μ² V₀²)/(ħ⁴ (2k sin (θ/2))⁶) [ sin(2kR sin (θ/2)) − 2kR sin (θ/2) cos(2kR sin (θ/2)) ]²

Candidate 2:
σ(θ)= (4 m² V₀²)/(ħ⁴ Δ⁶) [ sin(ΔR) − ΔR cos(ΔR) ]²,   with Δ = 2k sin (θ/2).

If we substitute Δ = 2k sin (θ/2) into Candidate 2, the trigonometric factor matches Candidate 1 exactly.  
The denominators are identical because Δ⁶ = (2k sin (θ/2))⁶.  

The only apparent difference is μ² versus m².  
For a “heavy” (fixed) nucleus the scattering problem is treated with the nucleon mass; the reduced mass μ therefore equals the nucleon mass m. Hence μ = m in this context, so the two prefactors coincide.

Therefore the two expressions are the same differential cross-section formula.

Both candidates give the transition probability as

P ∝ (e E₀)² a₀² / ħ² × 1/(Γ² + ω²),

and their numerical prefactors coincide:

• Candidate 1 prefactor = 2¹⁵/3¹⁰ = 32768/59049.  
• Candidate 2 prefactor = (256²)/(243² · 2) = 65536/(118098) = 32768/59049.

Since ω₂₁ = (E₂ − E₁)/ħ, the denominators are also identical. Therefore the two expressions are algebraically the same.

• Candidate 2: (128 √2 / 243)² = (2⁷ √2 / 3⁵)² = 2¹⁴·2 / 3¹⁰ = 2¹⁵ / 3¹⁰.

These are identical. Both also include a₀², e², E₀², ħ², and the same Lorentzian denominator with the transition frequency (ω₂₁ = ω_{fi}). Thus the two expressions are algebraically the same.

For part (a) the candidates give different angular dependences:

• Candidate 1: I ∝ sin²θ (1 + α cos θ)  
• Candidate 2: I ∝ 1 + cos²θ  

These expressions are not the same for any constant α (they cannot be identical as functions of θ).

For part (b) both give the same restriction (I ∝ sin²θ), but since the answers for part (a) disagree, the overall sets of answers are not identical.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question has four sub-parts, and part (d) itself requires three separate pieces of information:  
 (i) eigenvalues,  
 (ii) normalized eigenvectors,  
 (iii) a statement commenting on whether the eigenvectors are orthogonal.

Comparison:

1. (a) Series sum – both give 1/(1-x)².  
2. (b) Mean and most-probable values – both give 2λ and λ.  
3. (c) Integral – both give π/8.  
4. (d-i) Eigenvalues – both give the multiset {3, –3, 7}.  
5. (d-ii) Normalized eigenvectors – both provide the same three vectors (order differs but order is irrelevant).  
6. (d-iii) Orthogonality comment – Candidate 2 states “Eigenvectors are not orthogonal,” whereas Candidate 1 gives no statement at all.

Because Candidate 1 omits the required orthogonality comment while Candidate 2 supplies it, the two answers are not fully identical for all requested outputs (Rule 2). Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for

1. the energy spectrum,
2. the degeneracy,
3. the eigenfunctions.

Comparison of the two candidates:

Energy spectrum  
• Candidate 1:  E = p_z²/(2m) − (n+½) (e H₀ ħ)/(m c)  
  – Gaussian‐cgs units (factor 1/c) are used.  
  – Overall minus sign would give a positive contribution only if one inserts the electron’s negative charge; otherwise it is negative.

• Candidate 2:  E = ħ ω_c (n+½) + ħ²k_z²/(2m),  ω_c = e H₀/m (SI units, no factor 1/c).  

Even after choosing consistent sign conventions, the two formulas differ by a factor c; hence they are numerically different.

Eigenfunctions  
• Candidate 2 gives the usual Landau‐gauge wave-functions (plane waves in y, z and harmonic-oscillator functions in x with the correct Gaussian decay).  
• Candidate 1’s exponent contains “+ (eH₀/2ħc)(x−x₀)²”, i.e. a growing exponential rather than the required decaying Gaussian, so the function is not normalisable; also the Hermite-polynomial argument carries an opposite sign.

Degeneracy  
• Candidate 2 correctly states the infinite Landau degeneracy; Candidate 1 says nothing explicit.

Because the energies, eigenfunctions, and completeness of information all disagree, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for the optimal value of the variational parameter λ.  

• Candidate 1 supplies an expression for the minimum energy ⟨H⟩ₘᵢₙ, not for λ.  
• Candidate 2 supplies an explicit formula for λ.

Thus the two candidates are giving answers for different physical quantities (energy vs. parameter λ). They are therefore not equivalent (Rule 6/type mismatch, Rule 2 requirement that the requested answer be provided).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for the value of the parameter λ that minimizes the variational energy.

• Candidate 1 provides an expression for the minimum energy ⟨H⟩₍min₎, not for λ.  
• Candidate 2 provides an expression for λ, namely \( \left( \frac{3bm}{4\hbar^{2}} \right)^{1/6} \).

Since the two candidates give different physical quantities (energy versus the parameter λ), they are not answering the same thing and therefore are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different analytical expressions for the same integral.

1.  Rewrite candidate 1 using the standard relation  
   H₀^{(1)}(i x) = (2/π) i^{-1} K₀(x) = –(2 i/π) K₀(x).  
   Then  
   (i π)/(2λ)·H₀^{(1)}(iλρ)·sinh(λt)  
   = (i π)/(2λ)·[–(2 i/π) K₀(λρ)]·sinh(λt)  
   = (1/λ) K₀(λρ) sinh(λt).

2.  Candidate 2 is (π)/(2λ) I₀(λρ) sin(λt).

Thus candidate 1 gives (1/λ) K₀(λρ) sinh(λt) while candidate 2 gives (π/2λ) I₀(λρ) sin(λt).  
These involve different Bessel‐type functions (K₀ vs I₀), different trigonometric factors (sinh vs sin), and different overall constants, so they are not mathematically the same.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different closed‐form expressions.

• Candidate 1 expresses I(m) as a linear combination of ζ(k) for every k from 2 up to m + 1, plus a −2 ln 2 term.

• Candidate 2 gives I(m) as a single multiple of ζ(m + 2) with no lower-index zeta values and no logarithm term.

Already for m = 1 we get

 Candidate 1: I(1)=−2 ln 2 + (3/2) ζ(2)

 Candidate 2: I(1)= (7/2) ζ(3),

which are plainly not equal. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidate expressions are not equivalent.

Reasoning:

1. Evaluate both expressions at a = 0 (which should be an allowed value since the integrand then vanishes and the principal-value integral is 0).

   • Candidate 1:  
     2 ψ(½) − ψ(½+0) − ψ(½−0) = 2 ψ(½) − ψ(½) − ψ(½) = 0.

   • Candidate 2:  
     π[ψ(1+0) − ψ(0)].  
     ψ(1)=−γ (finite), but ψ(0)=−∞ (digamma has a pole at 0), so the expression diverges to ±∞.

   The results differ (0 versus divergence). Therefore the formulas cannot be identical functions of a.

2. More generally, as a → 0⁺, Candidate 2 behaves like 2π/a (because ψ(a/2) ≈ −γ − 2/a), while Candidate 1 remains finite. Hence the mismatch is systematic, not just at the single point a=0.

Since the two expressions give different values (and even different qualitative behavior) for the same input, they are inequivalent.

Both candidates give the logarithm of the same complex number 2 + i.  

• Candidate 1: “log(2+i)”  
• Candidate 2: “ln(2 + i)”

In standard mathematical usage, “ln” denotes the natural logarithm, and “log” (when the base is not specified) is also conventionally the natural logarithm in a calculus/analysis context. Since the problem statement does not specify different bases, there is no unit or base mismatch. The two notations represent the same mathematical quantity.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

The two expressions are clearly different:

• Candidate 1:  
Im(I) = −(√2 π k / 4) J₁(√2 a k) [ π H₀(√2 a k) + 2 − π H₁(√2 a k) ]

This contains the factor J₁(√2 a k) multiplied by a bracket involving both H₀ and H₁.

• Candidate 2:  
Im(I) = −2 π H₁(a k)

This has only H₁, with no J₁ or H₀ present, and the argument of the Struve function (a k) differs from that in candidate 1 (√2 a k).

Because the structures, factors, and arguments are all different, no general identity transforms one into the other for arbitrary k and a. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit expressions:

• Candidate 1: π (c − √(c² − a²))  (contains only a and c)

• Candidate 2: π a / √(b² + c²)  (contains a, b, c)

Since Candidate 2 depends on b while Candidate 1 does not, the two expressions cannot be algebraically identical for general positive b, c, a with b > c > a. Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:  (n² − 1)/(n² + 1)²

The numerators and denominators match exactly; there is no difference in factors or powers. Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

The quantity inside the logarithm, (1 + eˣ)/(2 + eˣ), is always positive because eˣ > 0, so 1 + eˣ > 0 and 2 + eˣ > 0 for all real x.  
Hence ln|(1 + eˣ)/(2 + eˣ)| and ln((1 + eˣ)/(2 + eˣ)) differ only by the unnecessary absolute-value bars and represent the same antiderivative up to an additive constant.

• Candidate 2: \(G\)

The extra term in Candidate 1 equals \(\dfrac{\pi}{16}(4-\pi) - \dfrac{1}{2}\log 2 \approx -0.178\neq 0\).

The two candidates are **not equivalent**.  
Candidate 2 includes the arbitrary constant of integration “+ C,” whereas Candidate 1 gives only a particular antiderivative with that constant implicitly set to zero. Because the question asks for an indefinite integral (for which the constant of integration is a required component), Candidate 1 omits information that Candidate 2 provides. Thus, the answers differ in a crucial component and are not equivalent.

The two candidates give clearly different expressions.

• Candidate 1 is a long combination of logarithms and polylogarithms that explicitly contains imaginary terms such as  (i π³)/12 and (i π/2)( … ).  Numerically those imaginary terms do **not** cancel, so Candidate 1 represents a complex number.

• Candidate 2 is the purely real quantity ½ ζ(3) – (π²/12) ln 2 + (ln 2)³/6.

Because the first result is complex while the second is real, the two answers cannot be the same value of the given real integral.

The two candidates give completely different symbolic expressions for the value of the integral.  
Candidate 1 contains terms involving Li₄(½), ζ(5) ln 2, π² ζ(3) ln 2, etc., none of which appear (or cancel) in Candidate 2. Conversely, Candidate 2 contains only combinations of ζ(2), ζ(3) and powers of ln 2. Because the formulas are not algebraically identical and cannot be transformed into one another by obvious simplifications, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Numerically,

• Candidate 1 ≈ (5/3) ζ(3) − (π/3) Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 0.940584  
• Candidate 2 ≈ 2 ζ(3) − (π²/6) ln 2 ≈ 1.26393

The values differ well beyond 6 significant digits, so the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different closed-form expressions and their numerical values are not the same (≈ 1.29 vs. ≈ 1.43). Therefore they are not equivalent.

The two expressions are generally not the same.

Let  
 F(r) = Candidate 1 = –∫ᵣ^∞ dr₂  r₂^{–(d–1)} ∫₀^{r₂} σ^{d–1} s(σ) dσ  
 G(r) = Candidate 2 = 1/(d–2) [ r^{–(d–2)} ∫ᵣ^∞ τ^{d–1}s(τ)dτ – ∫ᵣ^∞ τ s(τ)dτ ]  (d ≠ 2).

With J(r)=∫ᵣ^∞ τ^{d–1}s(τ)dτ and I(r)=∫₀^{r} σ^{d–1}s(σ)dσ (so I+J=const ≡ T), one finds  

 F′(r)= r^{–(d–1)} I(r), G′(r)= –r^{–(d–1)} J(r)

⇒ F′–G′ = T r^{–(d–1)}.

Integrating from r to ∞ (using F(∞)=G(∞)=0) gives  

 F(r) – G(r) = –T/(d–2)  r^{–(d–2)}.

Thus F and G coincide only if T = ∫₀^{∞} τ^{d–1}s(τ) dτ = 0.  
For a general source s(r) this integral is not zero; then the difference term is non-vanishing (and in fact makes G(r) singular at r = 0 for d>2), so the two formulas are not equivalent. Moreover, Candidate 2 fails for d=2 (division by zero).

Hence, under the stated boundary conditions (regular at 0 for all admissible s(r)), Candidate 1 is correct while Candidate 2 is not generally valid.

Candidate 1’s answer is the series  

  ∑_{k=1}^{∞} 1/k²  = π²/6 ,  

a constant that does not depend on n.

Candidate 2 writes  

  π²/6 + (7 π⁴)/(360 n²) + … ,  

an expression that still involves n (extra terms of order 1/n², 1/n⁴, …).  
Because those n-dependent terms are non-zero for any finite n, Candidate 2’s expression is not identical to the constant value given by Candidate 1.  The two predictions therefore represent different mathematical quantities.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for the value of the limit (a fixed constant) and wants that constant written as an infinite series.  

• Candidate 1 gives  
 Σ_{k=1}^{∞} 1/k² ,  
which equals π²/6 – a single constant, independent of n.

• Candidate 2 writes  
 π²/6 + 7 π⁴/(360 n²) + 31 π⁶/(15120 n⁴) + ⋯ .  
This still contains the variable n; it is an asymptotic expansion of the expression before the limit is taken, not the constant value of the limit itself. Consequently, for any finite n it is different from π²/6, and it is not an “infinite series” representation of the constant that the limit equals.

Because Candidate 2 does not actually give the same n-independent value that Candidate 1 gives, the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 6: type/variable mismatch).

Candidate 1: 5.4287 × 10⁶ ft-lb  
Candidate 2: 10 368 000 π ft-lb  
  ≈ 10 368 000 × 3.14159265 ≈ 3.2572 × 10⁷ ft-lb

5.4287 × 10⁶ ≠ 3.2572 × 10⁷ (they differ already at the first significant digit), so the answers are not equal to 6 significant digits.

The two candidates both state the answer as one-half of the natural logarithm of 2.  
Candidate 1 writes “log 2”; in a pure-mathematics context like this (centroid calculation in calculus), an unspecified “log” is conventionally taken to mean the natural logarithm, i.e. ln. Hence

log 2 = ln 2,

so both candidates give the identical value (ln 2)/2.

• Candidate 2:   A_{n−k} =    (d^k/dx^k)[(x−a)^n f(x)] |_{x=a}

Candidate 1 includes an extra factor of 1/k!, while Candidate 2 does not. Since this multiplicative factor changes the value of A_{n−k}, the two expressions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same value:

Candidate 1: γ − 2 + ln 4  
But ln 4 = ln(2²) = 2 ln 2, so  
γ − 2 + ln 4 = γ − 2 + 2 ln 2

Candidate 2: γ + 2 ln 2 − 2

Thus the two expressions are identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are algebraically the same:

• Candidate 1: −2 + γ + ln 4  
  ln 4 = ln(2²) = 2 ln 2 ⇒ expression becomes γ − 2 + 2 ln 2

• Candidate 2: γ + 2 ln 2 − 2  
  Already in the form γ − 2 + 2 ln 2

Since both simplify to γ − 2 + 2 ln 2, they are equivalent.

the two formulas are algebraically identical.

Both candidates give a single numerical expression for S, so we compare the two values.

Candidate 1:

• Γ(¼) ≈ 3.625609908  
• Γ(¼)⁴ ≈ 172.0  
• 16 π² ≈ 157.914  
⇒ prefactor ≈ 172.0 / 157.914 ≈ 1.089  
• (π – 3 ln 2) ≈ 1.062151  

⇒ S₁ ≈ 1.089 × 1.062151 ≈ 1.159 (to six significant digits: 1.15890)

Candidate 2:  
S₂ = (π/2) ln 2  
• (π/2) ln 2 ≈ 1.088793 (to six significant digits: 1.08879)

Comparing 1.15890 and 1.08879, they differ already in the third significant digit, so they are not equal to six-digit precision (Rule 4).

Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the result

 π / sin(π α) · [ ζ(1 − α, a) − ζ(1 − α, b) ].

The two candidates give the result in the same form “constant × K(1/√2)”, but the multiplicative constants differ:

• Candidate 1: 2/3 ≈ 0.666667  
• Candidate 2: π/(2√2) ≈ 1.11111

Since 2/3 ≠ π/(2√2), the two expressions are not equal, hence the answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different numerical multiples of the same elliptic integral:

• Candidate 1: (2/3) K(1/√2) ≈ 0.666 … × K(1/√2)  
• Candidate 2: (1/2) K(1/√2) ≈ 0.500 … × K(1/√2)

Since 2/3 ≠ 1/2, the two answers are not equal.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different overall multiplicative coefficients in front of the same elliptic‐integral factor \(K\!\left(\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\):

• Candidate 1 coefficient: \(\dfrac{2}{3}\approx 0.666667\)

• Candidate 2 coefficient: \(\dfrac{\pi}{2\sqrt{2}}\approx 1.11072\)

These numerical values clearly differ (they do not match to six significant digits), so the two expressions are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not the same.

1.  After inserting the elementary closed‐form  
   \(K_{1/2}(z)=\sqrt{\dfrac{\pi}{2z}}\,e^{-z}\)  
   into Candidate 2 and simplifying, the overall prefactor and, more importantly, the total exponential factor differ from those in Candidate 1.

2.  Candidate 1 contains  
   \(\exp\!\bigl[\dfrac{i}{T}(\sqrt a+\sqrt b)^2\bigr]
       =\exp\!\bigl[\dfrac{i}{T}(a+b+2\sqrt{ab})\bigr]\).

3.  Candidate 2 yields, after simplification,  
   \(\exp\!\bigl[\dfrac{i}{T}(a+b-4\sqrt{ab})\bigr]\).

The exponents (and also the algebraic prefactors) are not equal for general positive \(a,b\). Hence the two candidates are inequivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas for \(g(x)\).

• Evaluate at \(x = 0\):

  – Candidate 2: \(g(0)= -2\sqrt{\pi}\,0\cdot\operatorname{erfc}(0)+\ln2=\ln2\).

These values differ ( \(2\ln2 \neq \ln2\) ), so the two expressions cannot represent the same function for all real \(x\).  
Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give exactly the same single numerical answer (“1”) with no units or qualifiers.  
The question asks for a single value, so multiplicity is satisfied (Rule 2).

Both candidates give completely different closed‐form expressions for the same integral:

• Candidate 1: an expression that is a constant e^{-b} plus an infinite series involving
  (b²−a²)/2 · Σ_{m=0}^{∞} a^{2m} Γ(−1−2m,b) {}_2F_1(−m,3/2;2;1−b²/a²).

• Candidate 2: a single closed form
  e^{-b}√(b²−a²)/b · Γ(½,b) {}_2F_1(½,½;1;a²/b²).

The two formulas contain different gamma parameters (−1−2m vs ½), different hypergeometric parameters (−m,3/2;2;… vs ½,½;1;…), and one is an infinite series while the other is not.  There is no obvious algebraic identity that converts one into the other, and no mapping of symbols is provided that would show them to be the same.  Hence, under the comparison rules, the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give completely different closed‐form expressions:

Candidate 1:
I = e^{-b} + ½ (b²–a²) Σ_{m=0}^{∞} a^{2m} Γ(−1−2m , b) · ₂F₁(−m , 3/2 ; 2 ; 1−b²/a²).

Candidate 2:
I = e^{−b} Γ(½ , b) · ₂F₁(½ , 1 ; 3/2 ; (a/b)²).

• Candidate 1 contains an explicit “+ e^{−b}” term and an infinite series involving Γ(−1−2m , b).  
• Candidate 2 has a single factor Γ(½ , b) and no infinite series.  
• The hypergeometric parameters differ ((−m,3/2;2; …) versus (½,1;3/2; …)).  
• There is no evident algebraic identity that turns the infinite series plus extra term of Candidate 1 into the compact single hypergeometric of Candidate 2.

Because the two formulae are structurally and algebraically different, they cannot be considered the same result. Hence the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question requires three separate limits.  
Both candidates give three answers, but they differ on the third one:

(i) n=m  
• C1: 1 • C2: 1 → same

(ii) m>n  
• C1: 0 • C2: 0 → same

(iii) n>m  
• C1: “limit does not exist”  
• C2: “∞”  

“Does not exist” and “∞” are not identical statements; Rule 2 says every sub-answer must match exactly. Hence the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 do ​not give the same description of the convergence set or of the limit assignment.

• Candidate 1 lists many concrete initial values such as 2, 0, ±√2, etc., and says which of them converge to −2 and which to 1.

• Candidate 2 claims convergence only for “finite nested radicals of the form ±√(2 ± √(2 ± ⋯)),” and merely states that the corresponding limits are 1 or −2, without the detailed partition given in Candidate 1.  It does not explicitly include initial values like 0 or 2 (and these are not obviously of the stated nested-radical form).

Because the two answers describe different convergence sets and give different (or incomplete) limit classifications, they are inequivalent.

The two candidates give different parameter ranges for convergence/divergence and different dependence on the initial value \(a_0\):

• Candidate 1: convergence for \(0\le c\le\sqrt2\approx1.4142\) for every \(a_0\); divergence for \(c>\sqrt2\).

• Candidate 2: convergence for \(0<c\le1\) (all \(a_0\)) and for \(1<c<e^{1/e}\approx1.4447\) only for \(a_0\) in the basin of attraction; divergence for \(c\ge e^{1/e}\).

Because \(\sqrt2\neq e^{1/e}\) and the dependence on \(a_0\) differs, the predictions are not the same.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different thresholds and different dependence on the initial value:

• Candidate 1: convergence for 0 ≤ c ≤ √2 (≈ 1.41421) independent of a₀; divergence for c > √2.  
• Candidate 2: convergence region 0 < c ≤ e^{1/e} (≈ 1.44467) with additional subdivisions (dependence on a₀ when 1 < c ≤ e^{1/e}); divergence only for c > e^{1/e}.

Since √2 and e^{1/e} are different numbers and the qualitative descriptions differ (independence vs. dependence on a₀), the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give single closed-form expressions for the same integral, so we just need to check whether the two expressions are identical.

Candidate 1:
512 Im Li₄((1+i)/2) + (8π/3) ln²(2) ln(2) + 6 π³ ln(2) − 384 β(4)

Candidate 2:
8 π β(4)

Using high-precision numerical values

• Im Li₄((1+i)/2) ≈ 0.534022885  
• β(4) ≈ 0.988944551  
• ln(2) ≈ 0.6931471806

gives

Candidate 1 ≈ 25.4064  
Candidate 2 ≈ 24.8549

The two numbers differ by about 0.55, far beyond the 6-significant-digit tolerance required for equality. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give clearly different expressions.

• Candidate 1: 512 Im Li₄((1+i)/2) + (8π/3) ln² 2·ln 2 + 6π³ ln 2 − 384 β(4)  
  (a complicated combination of transcendental constants)

• Candidate 2: 320/9 ≈ 35.555 556 (a simple rational number)

A quick numerical evaluation of Candidate 1 (using standard values
Im Li₄((1+i)/2)≈0.5340225 and β(4)≈0.988944) gives

512·0.5340225 + (8π/3)·ln²2·ln 2 + 6π³·ln 2 − 384·0.988944 ≈ 25.406,

which differs markedly from 35.556.

Thus the two answers are not equivalent.

         = (1 / 2^{p−1}) π^{p/2}/Γ(p/2)

The two expressions differ in several essential ways:

1. Overall prefactor  
   • Candidate 1 has π / √2 · (z/2)^{1/4} e^{-z}.  
   • Candidate 2 has only √(π/2).  
   These cannot be made equal for all z.

2. Combination of Bessel functions  
   • Candidate 1 involves I_{-1/4}(z) − sgn(ξ) I_{1/4}(z).  
   • Candidate 2 uses I_{-1/4}(z) + I_{1/4}(z).  
   The sign and the presence of sgn(ξ) are different.

Because the prefactors and the Bessel-function combinations do not match, the two candidates cannot be equivalent.

• Candidate 1 supplies both: α = –1 and L = 2/π.  
• Candidate 2 gives only “2/π,” which can at best be interpreted as L; it provides no value for α.

Because Candidate 2 omits one of the required answers, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

• Candidate 1 provides a function that depends on g (it varies with g).  
• Candidate 2 says the value is the constant 1, independent of g.  

For g = 3, for example, Candidate 1’s expression is clearly not 1, so the answers cannot be equivalent for all g > 2.

The two candidates give different functional forms for z(x,y):

Candidate 1: z(x,y)= [2 a x sin y]/(2 − a²x)

Candidate 2: z(x,y)= sin y · sinh(a x)

Expanding both in a power series about x = 0 (with sin y factored out)

• Candidate 2: sinh(a x)= a x + (a³x³)/6 + … (only odd powers)

• Candidate 1: (2 a x)/(2−a²x)= a x [1 + (a²x)/2 + (a⁴x²)/4 + …]  
       = a x + (a³x²)/2 + … (contains an x² term)

Because Candidate 1 contains even‐power terms (x², x⁴, …) while Candidate 2 contains only odd‐power terms, the two expressions cannot be the same for general x. Hence the two proposed solutions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the density, for (u,y) in the set [0,1]×ℝ,

      f_{X,Y}(F_X^{*-1}(u), y) / f_X(F_X^{*-1}(u)).

Candidate 1 multiplies this by 1_{[0,1]}(u).  
Because the measure itself is defined only on [0,1]×ℝ, the indicator is automatically satisfied; outside that set the measure is not considered. Thus the indicator factor does not change the density on the domain where it is needed.

Hence the two expressions represent the same density function on the relevant domain.

Candidate 1 contains a non-zero term with the Apery constant ζ(3) (specifically, 5 π ln 2 · ζ(3)).  
Candidate 2 has no ζ(3) term at all (it involves only π and powers of ln 2).

Because ζ(3) cannot be expressed as an elementary combination of π and logarithms of rational numbers, a non-zero ζ(3) term cannot cancel out with the other constants present in Candidate 1. Hence the two expressions cannot be the same.

The two candidates give different analytic expressions.

Candidate 1:
I(n)= (1/√n)[ −π²/32 − ½ Li₂((n−√n)/(n+√n)) + ⅛ Li₂(−((n−√n)/(n+√n))²) + (π/4) arctan√n ].

Candidate 2:
I(n)= −π²/(32√n) + (π/(4√n)) arctan√n.

Candidate 2 matches only the first and last terms of Candidate 1; it omits the dilogarithm terms. For n=1 the omitted terms happen to vanish, but for a generic n (e.g., n=4) the combination
−½ Li₂(r) + ⅛ Li₂(−r²) with r=(n−√n)/(n+√n)
is non-zero, so the two expressions differ.

Hence the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidate expressions are unequal.  
Evaluating at \(n = 1\):

• Candidate 1 gives  
\(I(1) \;=\; -\dfrac{\pi^{2}}{32} + \dfrac{\pi}{4}\arctan 1 \;=\; -\dfrac{\pi^{2}}{32} + \dfrac{\pi}{4}\cdot\dfrac{\pi}{4} \;=\; \dfrac{\pi^{2}}{32}\).

• Candidate 2 gives  
\(I(1) \;=\; \dfrac{1}{2}\Bigl(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\arctan 1 - \operatorname{Li}_{2}(1)\Bigr) \;=\; \dfrac{1}{2}\Bigl(\dfrac{\pi}{2}\cdot\dfrac{\pi}{4} - \dfrac{\pi^{2}}{6}\Bigr) \;=\; -\dfrac{\pi^{2}}{48}\).

Since \(\pi^{2}/32 \ne -\pi^{2}/48\), the two formulae do not agree, so the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical value for the root.  
Expressed to six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1: 1.42000…  
• Candidate 2: 1.42800…

Since 1.42000 and 1.42800 differ before the sixth significant digit, the two answers are not the same according to Rule 4.

The answer must be a two-element list.  
Both candidates give two elements in the same order, but we must compare each corresponding number to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

First element:  
• Candidate 1 = 0.333 → interpreted as 0.333000  
• Candidate 2 = 1/3 → 0.333333…  
The values differ starting at the 4th significant digit (0 vs 3), so they are not equal to 6-digit precision.

Second element: 0.25 vs 1/4 are equal (0.250000 each), but equivalence requires every corresponding entry to match.

Since the first entries are not equal to 6 significant digits, the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

The numerical value of Candidate 2 is

exp(5/4) − exp(3/4) ≈ 3.490343 − 2.117000 = 1.373343.

Expressed to six significant digits: 1.37334.

Candidate 1 gives 1.3733, which to six significant digits is 1.37330.

Since 1.37330 ≠ 1.37334 at the sixth significant digit, the two answers are not identical under Rule 4.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The numerical value of e^{5/4} − e^{3/4} :

e^{1.25} ≈ 3.490342957  
e^{0.75} ≈ 2.117000017  
Difference ≈ 1.373342941

Expressed to 6 significant digits: 1.37334.

Candidate 1 gives 1.3733 → 1.37330 to 6 significant digits.

Since 1.37330 ≠ 1.37334, the two answers do not match to 6 significant digits as required by Rule 4.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers are not the same.

Candidate 1: 1.3733 → expressed to six significant digits: 1.37330

Since 1.37330 ≠ 1.37334 at the sixth significant digit, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question gives distances in metres, so the expected answer is also in metres.  

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 1.3 (unit omitted), which in this context is naturally interpreted as 1.3 m.  
Candidate 2 explicitly states 1.30 m.  

Numerically, 1.3 m = 1.30 m, and they match to 6 significant digits (1.30000 vs 1.30000).  
The absence of the unit in Candidate 1 does not introduce real ambiguity here, because metres are the only reasonable unit given the problem’s data (2.46 m axle spacing).  

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the list [2.0, 1.32] (no units).  
Candidate 2 gives the list [1.3229 kVAR, 2.0 kVA].

1. The numerical entries differ:  
   • First entries: 2.0 vs 1.3229 (not equal).  
   • Second entries: 1.32 vs 2.0 (not equal).

2. Even if one tries to interpret a possible swap of order, 1.32 and 1.3229 do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4).

3. Candidate 1 omits units, whereas Candidate 2 includes explicit units, creating additional ambiguity (Rule 1).

Because the lists differ in both order and values, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical value (binding energy) in MeV.  
• Candidate 1: “28.3” (implicitly MeV)  
• Candidate 2: “28.296 MeV”

Comparing the numbers to six significant digits:
– Candidate 1 → 28.3000  
– Candidate 2 → 28.2960  

They differ starting at the third significant digit (28.3000 ≠ 28.2960). Therefore, according to Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.
The question asks for a single numerical value (a binding-energy) in MeV.

Candidate 1: 28.3   (unit not written, but context implies MeV)  
Candidate 2: 28.296 MeV

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 28.3000  
• Candidate 2 → 28.2960

The two numbers differ already in the third significant digit (0.3000 vs 0.2960).  
Under Rule 4, answers must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent.

Hence the two predictions are not the same.

Both candidates give the same numerical value:

• Candidate 1: 2.0 → 2.00000 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 2   → 2.00000 (to six significant digits)

The values match exactly, and no units are involved. Therefore the answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
2.0 and 2 represent the same numerical value.  
Expressed to six significant digits, both are 2.00000, so they match exactly (Rule 4).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
25.3 (which is 25.3000 to six significant digits) and 8√10 (≈ 25.298221… → 25.2982 to six significant digits) differ beginning at the third significant digit.  
They therefore do not match to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers are numerical values.

• Candidate 1: 25.3 → written with six significant digits: 25.3000  
• Candidate 2: 8√10 ≈ 25.298221… → six significant digits: 25.2982

Since 25.3000 ≠ 25.2982 at six-significant-digit precision, the two predictions are not identical.

The two antiderivative expressions are, after rewriting Candidate 1

 Candidate 1: (1/6)·(4+x²)^{3/2}/x³  (+ C)

 Candidate 2: −(1/3)·(4+x²)^{3/2}/x³  (+ C)

They differ by a multiplicative factor of −2 (they are not related simply by an additive constant). Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give antiderivatives that coincide for \(x>0\), but

Candidate 1:  \(\dfrac{1}{6}\left(1+\frac{4}{x^{2}}\right)^{3/2}+C
              =\dfrac{(x^{2}+4)^{3/2}}{6|x|^{3}}+C\)

Candidate 2:  \(\dfrac{(x^{2}+4)^{3/2}}{6x^{3}}+C\)

Because \(|x|^{3}=x^{3}\) for \(x>0\) but \(|x|^{3}=-x^{3}\) for \(x<0\), the two expressions differ by a sign when \(x<0\). Hence they are not the same antiderivative on the whole domain \(x\neq0\); they cannot be made equal by adding a constant.

The problem asks for “the points where local maxima and minima … occur,” i.e., full (x, y) coordinates.

Candidate 1 supplies complete points:
• Max: (1, 13)  
• Min: (–1, –19) and (8, 8)

Candidate 2 gives only x‐coordinates:
• Max at x = 1  
• Min at x = –1 and x = 8

Because Candidate 2 omits the y-values that are explicitly required, it does not provide all requested information. Hence the two answers are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 6).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give two different antiderivatives.

• Differentiate Candidate 2:
d/dx[(1/5) sin⁵x – (3/7) sin⁷x + (1/3) sin⁹x – (1/11) sin¹¹x]
= sin⁴x cosx [1 – 3 sin²x + 3 sin⁴x – sin⁶x]
= sin⁴x cosx (cos²x)³
= sin⁴x cos⁷x.

This derivative is sin⁴x cos⁷x, not the required integrand sin⁴x cos⁶x. Hence Candidate 2 is incorrect.

• Differentiate Candidate 1.  One finds
d/dx = (1/32) sin⁴(2x) cos(2x) + 3/256 – (1/64) cos4x + 1/256 cos8x,
which simplifies (using trig identities) exactly to sin⁴x cos⁶x.  Numerical checks (x=0, π/4, π/2) confirm this.

Thus Candidate 1 is a correct antiderivative, whereas Candidate 2 is not. They are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same set of solutions.

• Candidate 1 writes the solution (twice in two equivalent trig-function forms) as  
 x = π/2 − arcsin(4/5) + 2πn (or, equivalently, x = π/2 − arccos(3/5) + 2πn).

• Candidate 2 writes the solution as  
 x = arctan(3/4) + 2πk.

Because
 arctan(3/4) = π/2 − arctan(4/3) = π/2 − arcsin(4/5) = π/2 − arccos(3/5),

both candidates describe exactly the same angle, and both include the identical 2π-periodic repetition (n, k ∈ ℤ).

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for four numerical answers (with the fourth possibly stated in centimetres).  

Candidate 1:  
1. 12  
2. 10  
3. –17  
4. 20  

Candidate 2:  
1. 12  
2. 10  
3. –17  
4. 20 cm  

• All four numerical values match exactly.  
• For the width, “20 cm” (Candidate 2) and “20” (Candidate 1) are the same magnitude; the unit cm is implicit from the problem statement, so omitting it does not introduce ambiguity.

Hence, the two sets of answers are equivalent.

The two candidates give identical answers for parts 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7.  
For part 2 (“intervals where f is decreasing”) they differ:

• Candidate 1:  (−π/2, −π/3) ∪ (π/3, π/2) (open intervals)  
• Candidate 2:  [−π/2, −π/3) ∪ (π/3, π/2] (closed at x = −π/2 and x = π/2)

Thus Candidate 2 includes the endpoints −π/2 and π/2, whereas Candidate 1 excludes them.  
Because the two answers for this sub-problem are not the same sets, the candidates are not fully identical across all requested items. Under Rule 2, any discrepancy in any sub-answer makes the overall answers inequivalent.

Both answers are antiderivatives of  

  -10 ∫ cos⁴(5x)/sin³(5x) dx.

Rewrite each candidate in a common form.

1.  Candidate 1  
 F₁(x)=3 cos(5x)+cos³(5x)/(1−cos²(5x))−(3/2) ln((1+cos(5x))/(1−cos(5x)))+C.

2.  Candidate 2  
 F₂(x)=csc(5x) cot(5x)+2 cos(5x)+3 ln|tan(5x/2)|+C  
   = cos(5x)/(1−cos²(5x))+2 cos(5x)−(3/2) ln((1+cos(5x))/(1−cos(5x)))+C,
   using tan²(θ/2)=(1−cos θ)/(1+cos θ).

Set t = cos(5x).  
Then

 F₁ = 3t + t³/(1−t²) − (3/2)ln((1+t)/(1−t)) + C,  
 F₂ = 2t + t/(1−t²) − (3/2)ln((1+t)/(1−t)) + C.

Compute the difference:

 F₁ − F₂ = (3t−2t) + (t³−t)/(1−t²) = t + t(t²−1)/(1−t²)  
      = t − t = 0.

Hence F₁ and F₂ differ only by an (already-absorbed) constant; they are the same antiderivative.

Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

The question asks for nine separate items; both candidates supply an answer for each of the nine.  
For items 1 – 8 every entry is identical between the candidates.  
For item 9 (point of inflection) the x-coordinate matches, but the y-coordinates differ:

• Candidate 1: y ≈ 2.3146  
• Candidate 2: y = 9 / (2 √(2·(3/4^{1/3}))) ≈ 2.314647

Expressed to six significant digits (Rule 4):
 Candidate 1 → 2.31460  
 Candidate 2 → 2.31465  

These numbers disagree at the 6-th significant digit, so they are not equal to 6-digit precision.  
Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates give the same eight numbers:
1, −1, 5, −5, 1/2, −1/2, 5/2, −5/2.

Since the question only asks for the list of all possible rational zeros (order and format do not matter here) and both candidates supply exactly that same set, the answers are equivalent.

Reasoning:

• Both candidates agree on the radius of convergence ( R = ∞ ).

• For the sum, on every x ≠ 0 they give the same formula:
 (e^x (x − 1) + 1)/x².

• At x = 0 the series equals 1/2.  
 – Candidate 1 explicitly supplies the value f(0)=1/2 (piece-wise definition).  
 – Candidate 2 gives only the formula containing 1/x² and does not state the limiting
  value, so its answer is undefined at x = 0 and therefore incomplete.

Since the sum is required for all x in the interval of convergence (which includes x = 0), Candidate 2 omits a necessary piece of the answer. Thus the two answers are not equivalent.

The two proposed functions are  

• Candidate 1: y = |x| ⁄ 3 − 4 (piece-wise: y = x/3 − 4 for x ≥ 0, and y = −x/3 − 4 for x < 0)  
• Candidate 2: y = x ⁄ 3 − 4  (valid for all x ≠ 0)

For x > 0 (which includes the initial point x = 3) the two expressions coincide, but for x < 0 they differ:

 • Candidate 1 gives y = −x/3 − 4,  
 • Candidate 2 gives y = x/3 − 4.

Thus the two functions are not identical on the full domain where the differential equation can be considered (all x ≠ 0). Since the question asks for “the particular solution y = f(x)” without restricting the domain to x > 0, the answers must match everywhere they are defined. Because they differ for negative x, they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical “result” of “∞,” i.e. it claims the improper integral equals + infinity.  
Candidate 2 simply states “the integral diverges,” meaning it does not converge to any finite value.

For the two answers to be equivalent, the integral would have to diverge specifically to + ∞.  
In fact, the integrand has a vertical asymptote at x = 2; the integral from 0→2 diverges to −∞ while the integral from 2→3 diverges to +∞, so the overall improper integral is undefined (it does not converge to either +∞ or −∞). Hence “diverges” is correct, whereas “∞” is not.

Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the antiderivative

−(3/2)x^{2/3} + (2/3)x^{1/2} − (1/3)x^{1/3} + (2/9)x^{1/6} − (2/27)ln|1+3x^{1/6}|  + constant,

up to an additive constant.  
Candidate 1 writes ln((1/3)|1+3x^{1/6}|)=ln|1+3x^{1/6}|−ln 3, which differs from Candidate 2’s ln|3x^{1/6}+1| only by the constant −ln 3; the overall numerical factor −(2/27) converts this to an additive constant ( (2/27)ln 3 ).  All polynomial terms match exactly once the outside minus sign in Candidate 1 is distributed.

Hence the two antiderivatives differ only by an overall constant, so they are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives are not equivalent.

Derivative of Candidate 2 gives  
F2′(x)=−3 x^{−2/3}+… = −3 x^{−2/3}/(3x^{1/6}+1) ⋯,  
which does not match the original integrand −9 x^{1/3}/(9 x^{2/3}+3 x^{1/2}).  

Candidate 1 contains additional y³ and y⁴ terms, so the two expressions cannot differ merely by an additive constant.  

Hence they are inequivalent.

• an 8 cos²θ (or 16 cos²θ after collecting factors) integrand over π/3 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 (plus its symmetric counterpart in Candidate 2).

Candidate 1: 4 ∫₀^{π/3} 1 dθ + 16 ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ

Candidate 2 (after its own stated symmetry reduction):  
2 ∫_{−π/3}^{π/3} dθ + 16 ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ

The first terms each equal 4π/3, and the second terms are identical. Hence both candidates represent exactly the same total integral (same integrands and net coefficient over each angular range), so they are equivalent.

• Candidate 2 is

These differ, at most, by an arbitrary additive constant, which is acceptable for indefinite integrals. Hence the two expressions are mathematically identical as antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Both candidates give antiderivatives for  

∫ 3 / (sin²⁰? wait) integral: I = ∫ 3 /(sin(2x)⁷ cos(2x)) dx.

Candidate 1:  
F₁(x)= (3/2)[ ln|tan(2x)| − 3/(2 tan²(2x)) − 3/(4 tan⁴(2x)) − 1/(6 tan⁶(2x)) ] + C₁.

Rewrite in csc-powers:

tan⁻² = cot² = csc² −1  
tan⁻⁴ = cot⁴ = (csc² −1)² = csc⁴ − 2 csc² +1  
tan⁻⁶ = cot⁶ = (csc² −1)³ = csc⁶ − 3 csc⁴ + 3 csc² −1.

Substituting and collecting:

F₁(x)= 3/2 ln|tan|  
       −1/4 csc⁶ − 3/8 csc⁴ − 3/4 csc² + 11/8 + C₁.

Candidate 2:  
F₂(x)= −1/4 csc⁶ − 3/8 csc⁴ − 3/4 csc² + 3/2 ln|tan| + C₂.

Thus F₁(x)=F₂(x)+ (11/8 + C₁ − C₂), i.e. the two antiderivatives differ only by a constant. Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary additive constant, the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Term-by-term comparison:

   C2:  (3/4)(2x)^{2/3} = (3 · 2^{2/3}/4) x^{2/3}

2. Power term:  
   C1:  –9 · 2^{1/3} x^{1/3}  
   C2:  –9(2x)^{1/3} = –9 · 2^{1/3} x^{1/3}

3. Log term:  
   C1:  36 ln|4 + 2^{1/3} x^{1/3}|  
   C2:  36 ln((2x)^{1/3} + 4) = 36 ln(4 + 2^{1/3} x^{1/3}) (same argument; absolute-value difference only changes the result by a constant)

   C1: –3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2^{5/6})  
   C2: –3 arctan((2x)^{1/6}/2) = –3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2^{5/6})

The question requests two values: 
1) the length of the gallery,  
2) the height at the center of the gallery.  

Candidate 1 gives  
• length = 96 ft  
• height ≈ 26.53 ft  

Candidate 2 gives  
• answer 1 = 96 ft

Length: 96 ft vs 96 ft → identical.  

Height:  
8√11 ft = 26.532998 ft → to six significant digits: 26.5330  
Candidate 1’s 26.53 ft → expressed to six significant digits: 26.5300

The question asks for both roots of the quadratic.  
Candidate 1 supplies exact forms; Candidate 2 supplies decimal approximations.

• Root 1  
 Candidate 1: 2 + √(13/2) ≈ 4.549509757 … → six‐sig-fig value = 4.54951  
 Candidate 2: 4.55 → six‐sig-fig value = 4.55000  

 4.54951 ≠ 4.55000 at the sixth significant digit.  

• Root 2

 Candidate 2: –0.55 → six-sig-fig value = –0.550000  

 –0.549510 ≠ –0.550000 at the sixth significant digit.

• Candidate 1: 1 / [16 · | sin(t / 2) |]

Both candidates provide antiderivatives whose derivatives equal the integrand \(\cos^4 \!\left(\tfrac{x}{2}\right)\).  
After algebraic simplification one finds that

Candidate 1:  
\[
\frac{\sin\!\left(\tfrac{x}{2}\right)\cos^3\!\left(\tfrac{x}{2}\right)}{2}
+\frac{3}{4}\Bigl(\sin\!\left(\tfrac{x}{2}\right)\cos\!\left(\tfrac{x}{2}\right)+\tfrac{x}{2}\Bigr)
\]

equals

Candidate 2:  
\[
\frac{3x}{8}+\frac12\sin x+\frac1{16}\sin 2x
\]

up to an additive constant (indeed, they are identical as written).  
Hence the two answers are mathematically the same.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are antiderivatives of the same integrand.  
Taking derivatives:

• Candidate 2 → d/dx [3/8 x + ½ sin x + 1/16 sin 2x] = 3/8 + ½ cos x + 1/8 cos 2x.  
Using the identity cos⁴(x/2)=⅛(3+4 cos x+cos 2x), this equals cos⁴(x/2).

• Candidate 1 differentiates to exactly the same expression 3/8 + ½ cos x + 1/8 cos 2x, hence also to cos⁴(x/2).

Since both derivatives equal the original integrand, the two expressions differ at most by an additive constant, making them equivalent antiderivatives.

The two antiderivatives can be simplified to

Candidate 1: I₁(x)=−(1/9)(1+3/x²)^{3/2}+C

Candidate 2: I₂(x)=−(1/9) sign(x) (1+3/x²)^{3/2}+C ,

because (x²+3)^{3/2}/x³ = sign(x)(1+3/x²)^{3/2}.

Thus I₂(x)=I₁(x) for x>0, but I₂(x)=−I₁(x) for x<0.  
Their difference on x<0 is not a constant; it depends on x, so the two expressions are not the same antiderivative on the whole domain (x≠0).

Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give:

1. A tangent vector of (1, 1) – exactly the same.

2. A normal vector that is a non-zero scalar multiple of each other:  
   Candidate 1: (1, −1)  
   Candidate 2: (−5, 5) = −5·(1, −1).

Because any non-zero scalar multiple represents the same direction for a normal vector, the two normal vectors are equivalent. Therefore both candidates provide the same answers (up to irrelevant scaling for the normal).

Both expressions differ by  

x + arctan(cot x),

whose derivative is

d/dx [x + arctan(cot x)] = 1 + (−csc²x)/(1 + cot²x) = 1 − 1 = 0.

Since they differ only by an additive constant, the two antiderivatives are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give an antiderivative of cot⁴x:  

Candidate 1:  F₁(x)=−(1/3) cot³x + cot x − arctan(cot x) + C₁  
Candidate 2:  F₂(x)=−(1/3) cot³x + cot x + x + C₂  

On any interval where a single branch of arctan can be chosen (so that arctan(cot x) is continuous), we have  
arctan(cot x)=arctan(tan(π/2−x)) = π/2 − x.  
Hence −arctan(cot x)=x − π/2.

Substituting into F₁ gives  
F₁(x)=−(1/3) cot³x + cot x + x − π/2 + C₁  
=−(1/3) cot³x + cot x + x + (C₁ − π/2).

Thus F₁(x) and F₂(x) differ only by the constant (C₁ − π/2 − C₂). Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant, the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates identify the maximizing point as  

x = 12/5 = 2.4  
y =  6/5 = 1.2  

Candidate 1 also states the corresponding maximum utility value (≈16.715), but the coordinates coincide exactly.  
Because the question’s essential requirement is to find the maximizer under the given constraint—and both candidates give the same maximizer—the additional correct value provided by Candidate 1 does not create a conflict. Hence the two answers are equivalent.  

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same optimal point:  

• Candidate 1: point P = (2.4, 1.2).  
• Candidate 2: answer 1 = 12/5 = 2.4 and answer 2 = 6/5 = 1.2.

Thus the coordinates coincide exactly.  
The extra piece of information supplied by Candidate 1 (the maximum value 16.715) is allowed (Rule 2: extra detail is fine as long as required information is not missing).  
Candidate 2 does not omit any element that is clearly required—at minimum the problem needs the maximising (x,y), which it provides.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same integrand for positive frequencies, but  

• Candidate 1 integrates that integrand only over (0, ∞).  
• Candidate 2 integrates the same (even) integrand over (−∞, ∞).  

Because the integrand is even in ω, the integral from −∞ to ∞ equals twice the integral from 0 to ∞. Therefore Candidate 2’s expression equals 2 × Candidate 1’s expression, so the two answers are not mathematically identical representations of q(x).

The question asks for three specific answers:  
1) the linear cost function,  
2) an interpretation of its slope and intercept,  
3) the cost for 687 minutes.  

Candidate 1 gives  
• C(x)=0.15 x + 10,  
• interprets these numbers,  
• cost = 113.05.  

Candidate 2 gives  
• C(x)=0.1503 x + 9.8677,  
• interprets slope/intercept qualitatively,  
• cost = 113.14.  

The two cost functions differ (0.150000 vs 0.150300; 10 vs 9.8677), which already disagrees beyond 6 significant digits (Rule 4). Consequently the computed cost for 687 minutes also differs. Because at least one sub-answer is different, the overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both answers represent a single numerical value for the car’s speed:

• Candidate 1: 345.57519189 miles per hour  
• Candidate 2: 0.095993 miles per second

Convert Candidate 1 to miles per second:
345.57519189 mph ÷ 3600 s h⁻¹ ≈ 0.095993108858 mi s⁻¹

Now compare the two results to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

Candidate 1 (to 6 sig. figs) → 0.0959931  
Candidate 2 (interpreting the missing digit as 0) → 0.0959930

The sixth significant digit differs (1 vs 0), so the two numbers do not agree to 6 significant digits. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Therefore, despite agreeing on the direction vector and on the distance, the differing point P means the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Sub-answer 2 (number of periods in 1 s):
• Candidate 1: 58.56901906  
• Candidate 2: 184/π  
184/π = 58.56901905781749…, which matches Candidate 1’s value to at least six significant digits (58.5690). Hence they are numerically identical.

Both candidates provide both required answers, and for each sub-problem the values coincide. Therefore the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1:

Multiplying out:
(2/25)*(2/3) = 4/75, (2/25)*(2/7) = 4/175,

so Candidate 1 simplifies to
C + 4/75 tan^{3/2}(10x) + 4/175 tan^{7/2}(10x).

Candidate 2 directly states
4/75 tan^{3/2}(10x) + 4/175 tan^{7/2}(10x) + C.

These expressions are identical (up to the order of terms, which does not matter, and both include the integration constant C). Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates say:

• At (0, 0) the second-derivative test is inconclusive, so no definite classification (max, min, or saddle) is given.

Candidate 1’s extra lines “Maximum: None, Minimum: None, Saddle point: None” just restate that no type can be assigned; this does not contradict Candidate 2.

The question explicitly asks for the “point(s)” where the function attains local maxima and minima.

  – maxima at (−1, π/2) and (1, π/2);  
  – minimum at (0, π/4).  
• Candidate 2 gives only the x-coordinates:  
  – maxima at x = −1, 1;  
  – minimum at x = 0.  

Because Candidate 2 omits the y-coordinates that are part of each point, it fails to provide all components requested by the problem. Under Rule 2, an answer missing required data is not equivalent to one that includes it.

The two antiderivatives differ by  

arctan(tan x) – x.  

This quantity is not a single constant; it equals x – x = 0 on some intervals, but equals x – (x + π) = –π, x – (x – π) = π, etc., on other intervals, depending on which branch of arctan is taken.  
Because the difference between the candidates is not a constant function over the whole domain (only piece-wise constant), the two answers are not equivalent as single antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both antiderivatives differ by  

arctan(tan x) − x,

and on any open interval where tan x (and hence the integrand) is defined, this difference is a constant (its derivative is zero there).  Since indefinite integrals are only required to agree up to an additive constant on each such interval, the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives of tan⁴x.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by  

arctan(tan x) – x ,

whose derivative is 0 wherever it is defined.  Hence on every interval where tan x is continuous their difference is a (possibly different) constant, so each expression is a valid antiderivative of tan⁴x and can be reconciled by the additive constant C.  

Thus, for purposes of the indefinite integral, the answers are mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates give the same surface‐area value:

Candidate 1: S = (π/4)·[12√2 + ln(17 + 12√2)]
     = π·[3√2 + (1/4) ln(17 + 12√2)]

But (1 + √2)^4 = 17 + 12√2  ⇒  ln(17 + 12√2) = 4 ln(1 + √2).  
Hence (1/4) ln(17 + 12√2) = ln(1 + √2).

So Candidate 1 simplifies to: S = π·[3√2 + ln(1 + √2)], which is exactly Candidate 2.

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers for all nine requested items, and in each item the content matches:

1. Domain: identical intervals  
2. Vertical asymptotes: same two x-values  
3. Horizontal asymptotes: both state none  
4. Slant asymptote: both give y = 2x  
5. Increasing intervals: identical  
6. Decreasing intervals: identical  
7. Concave-up intervals: identical  
8. Concave-down intervals: identical  
9. Inflection point: Candidate 1 writes “x = 0”, while Candidate 2 writes “(0, 0)”.  Since the function value at x = 0 is y = 0, these both refer to the same point on the curve, so they are mathematically equivalent.

Because every sub-answer is the same (differences are only notational), the two sets of predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates give identical answers for items 1–4, 6–9, but differ on item 5 (“Intervals where the function is increasing”).  

• Candidate 1 lists the increasing set as  
   (−∞, −6)  and  (−2, 0)  and  (0, ∞)  
   —which omits the single point 0.  

• Candidate 2 lists it as  
   (−∞, −6)  and  (−2, ∞)  
   —which includes the point 0.

Since the intervals (−2, 0) ∪ (0, ∞) and (−2, ∞) are not identical (they differ by the point 0), the two predictions do not exactly match for sub-problem 5.  
According to Rule 2, any discrepancy in required sub-answers makes the overall answers inequivalent.

Both candidates describe the same two lines.

Candidate 1:

2. 4y + 24√2 x − 29 = 0  ⇒ y = −6√2 x + 29/4  

Candidate 2 already lists those two equations in slope–intercept form:
1. y = 6√2 x + 29/4  
2. y = −6√2 x + 29/4  

Thus each candidate provides exactly the same pair of lines.

Both candidates provide expressions for two required quantities, y′ and y″.

1. For y′  
  Candidate 1:  (x + 3y)/(2y – 3x)  
  Candidate 2:  –(x + 3y)/(3x – 2y)

 Since 2y – 3x = –(3x – 2y), Candidate 1’s fraction equals –(x + 3y)/(3x – 2y), which is exactly Candidate 2’s expression. Thus the y′ formulas are the same.

2. For y″  
  Candidate 1:  11(x² + 6xy – 2y²)/(3x – 2y)³  
  Candidate 2:  33/(3x – 2y)³

 Using the original constraint from the problem, x² + 6xy – 2y² = 3, Candidate 1’s numerator becomes 11 × 3 = 33, giving 33/(3x – 2y)³, identical to Candidate 2’s expression.

Therefore both sub-answers (y′ and y″) are mathematically identical, making the two candidates equivalent.

The two antiderivatives have the same logarithmic parts

•  −ln(1+tan^{2/3}(x/2))  
•  +(1/2)ln(1 − tan^{2/3}(x/2) + tan^{4/3}(x/2))

but differ in the coefficient of the arctangent term:

Candidate 1:  −√3 · arctan( (2 tan^{2/3}(x/2) − 1)/√3 )

Candidate 2:  +(1/√3) · arctan( (2 tan^{2/3}(x/2) − 1)/√3 )

The difference between these two terms is (−√3 − 1/√3)·arctan( … ), which depends on x and therefore is not a constant.  Since an antiderivative may only differ by an additive constant, the two expressions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give

S(x) = (1/4) ln((1+x)/(1−x)) − (1/2) arctan x,

the only difference being that Candidate 1 places absolute-value bars around the logarithm’s argument.  
For the natural domain of convergence of the series (|x|<1), (1+x)/(1−x) is positive, so the absolute values have no effect and the two formulas coincide. Thus the two answers are mathematically the same for the intended domain.

The constant terms differ only by an arbitrary additive constant, which is immaterial for an indefinite integral. Hence the two expressions are algebraically identical up to the integration constant.

The question asks to identify the maxima and/or minima of the given function.  
Candidate 1 lists both the x-coordinates and the corresponding y-values: maximum at (1, 2) and minimum at (−1, −2).  
Candidate 2 only states the x-coordinates where the local maximum and minimum occur, without giving the y-values.

Since Candidate 2 omits information (the function values) that Candidate 1 supplies and that is typically required when identifying maxima/minima of a function, the two answers are not equivalent under Rule 9 (omission of required elements).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates identify the same two critical points and give them the same classifications:

• Local maximum occurs at x = 1.  
• Local minimum occurs at x = –1.

Candidate 1 additionally states the corresponding y-values (2 and –2), but this extra detail is consistent with Candidate 2’s statements and does not conflict with them. Because the y-values are uniquely determined by the given function once the x-coordinates are known, omitting them does not make Candidate 2’s answer incomplete for the purpose of identifying the extrema.

Hence the two answers convey the same essential information and are equivalent.

5. p = 3

Candidate 1 gives
 I₁(x) = 2 sec x + (1/3) sec³ x + cos x + C.

Candidate 2 gives
 I₂(x) = (1/3) sec³ x − 2 sec x − cos x + C.

Subtracting (ignoring the arbitrary constant C):

I₁(x) − I₂(x) = 2 sec x + (1/3) sec³ x + cos x − [(1/3) sec³ x − 2 sec x − cos x]
               = 4 sec x + 2 cos x,

which plainly depends on x (its derivative is 4 sec x tan x − 2 sin x ≠ 0), so it is not a constant. Therefore the two antiderivatives are different and cannot both be correct representations of the same indefinite integral.

The two candidates do not describe the same solution set.  
Candidate 1’s formulas allow both x and y to be shifted by integer multiples of π/2 (through the parameter k), so for example (x,y) = (5π/6, 2π/3) is included.  
Candidate 2 only permits simultaneous shifts by integer multiples of π, so that pair (and others differing by an extra π/2) is absent.  
Thus Candidate 2 gives only a subset of the solutions listed by Candidate 1.  
Since the sets of answers are different, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question effectively has two separate requests:  

1. the local minimum value(s) (there turn out to be two of them),  
2. the local maximum value(s) (there is one of them).

Candidate 1 supplies both categories explicitly:

• minima: 13 and 85 (given as the y-coordinates of P(0,13) and P(6,85))  
• maximum: 295/3 (the y-coordinate of P(4, 295/3))

Candidate 2 just lists three numbers – 13, 85, 295/3 – without indicating which belong to the minima group and which to the maxima group.

According to Rule 3 (and Example 3-3), when different pieces of data must be assigned to different named quantities, an answer that omits that assignment (“0, 3”) is not equivalent to one that makes it explicit (“a=0, b=3”).  Here the categories “local minimum value(s)” and “local maximum value(s)” play the same role as the named quantities a and b.  Because Candidate 2 does not specify which value is the maximum, its response is ambiguous relative to the problem’s two sub-requests, whereas Candidate 1 removes the ambiguity.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

∂r/∂x: a x / √(a x² − b y²) — identical in both.  
∂r/∂y: −b y / √(a x² − b y²) — identical in both.

Candidate 1 merely adds extra (unrequested) derivatives with respect to a and b, but this does not conflict with the required x- and y-derivatives. Hence the answers coincide on what is required, making them equivalent.

• Candidate 2 coefficient of cos(nx):  − 1 / [ π (2 n² − 1) ]

For n = 1 these give −2/(3π) versus −1/π, which are not equal; hence the two series are not the same function term-by-term. Therefore the predictions are inequivalent.

Both candidates give exactly the same constant term, \( \dfrac{2\pi^{2}}{3} \).

For the cosine series, Candidate 1 writes
\[
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{8(-1)^{n}}{n^{2}}\cos\!\left(\frac{nx}{2}\right),
\]
while Candidate 2 writes
\[
8\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n}}{n^{2}}\cos\!\left(\frac{nx}{2}\right).
\]
Pulling the factor 8 outside the sum (or distributing it inside) does not change the value, so these two expressions are identical term-by-term.

Hence the two Fourier series are the same; the predictions are equivalent.

The question requires five numerical estimates.  
Both candidates provide five numbers, but we must compare each corresponding value to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

1. ln(16):  
   • Candidate 1: 2.78 ⇒ 2.78000  
   • Candidate 2: 2.7726 ⇒ 2.77260

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of answers are not identical (Rule 2).

The two candidates give  

• Candidate 1: (1 + cos x) / (1 − cos x)  
• Candidate 2: (1 + cos x)² / sin² x  

Algebraically, Candidate 2 simplifies to (1 + cos x)/(1 − cos x) after cancelling a factor (since sin² x = 1 − cos² x = (1 − cos x)(1 + cos x)).  
However, this cancellation removes the factor (1 + cos x) from the denominator, so the domains differ:

• Candidate 2 is undefined when sin x = 0 (i.e., x = kπ, including x = π where cos x = −1).  
• Candidate 1 is undefined only when 1 − cos x = 0 (x = 2kπ), but it is defined at x = π and actually equals 0 there.

Thus the two expressions are not identical as functions: at x = π (cos x = −1, sin x = 0) Candidate 1 gives 0 while Candidate 2 is undefined.  
Because they differ on their domains, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give

  − x − 2√x − 2 ln( … )

The only difference is in the logarithm’s argument:

• Candidate 1: ln|√x − 1|  
• Candidate 2: ln(1 − √x)

For the series ∑_{n=1}^{∞} x^{n/2+1}/(n/2+1) the radius of convergence is |x| < 1.  
For real x in this interval we have 0 ≤ √x < 1, hence 1 − √x > 0 and

  |√x − 1| = 1 − √x.

Thus ln|√x − 1| equals ln(1 − √x) on the entire domain where the series sum is defined.  
Therefore the two expressions are mathematically identical for the intended domain, and the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers for the two requested quantities, but they differ:

1. Gravity vector

   (Different basis directions.)

2. Tension vector  
   • Candidate 1: ‑19.6 k̂ (directed downward)  
   • Candidate 2: +19.6 ĵ (directed upward)

Because the tension directions are opposite and the gravity components use different unit-vector axes, the two sets of answers do not represent the same vectors. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives
I₁(x)=½ √(4x+1) arcsin(4x) + √(1−4x)+const₁.

Candidate 2 gives
I₂(x)=½ √(4x+1) arcsin(4x) − √(1−4x)+const₂.

The two antiderivatives differ by
I₁(x)−I₂(x)=2 √(1−4x)+(const₁−const₂),

which is not a constant function of x (the extra 2 √(1−4x) depends on x).  
Since indefinite integrals are only allowed to differ by an additive constant, the results are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical expression whose value is

Candidate 2 states the number 0.001968.

Write both answers to six significant digits:

• Candidate 2: 0.00196800  → 1.96800 × 10⁻³  

The digits differ at the 5th–6th significant places (…793 vs …800).  
According to Rule 4, the two quantities must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent. They do not.

Both expressions have the same derivative on every open interval where the integrand  
( 2 tan⁴(10x) ) is defined.

• Candidate 2:  
F₂(x)=tan³(10x)/15 − tan(10x)/5 + 2x

 dF₂/dx = 2 tan²(10x) sec²(10x) − 2 sec²(10x) + 2  
    = 2 tan⁴(10x)                                  

• Candidate 1:  
F₁(x)= (1/5)[ (1/3) tan³(10x) − tan(10x) + arctan(tan(10x)) ]

 dF₁/dx = 2 tan²(10x) sec²(10x) − 2 sec²(10x) + 2  
    = 2 tan⁴(10x)

Thus both are antiderivatives of the integrand.  
The two differ by  
F₁(x) − F₂(x) = (1/5)[arctan(tan(10x)) − 10x] ,  
which is constant on each interval between the singularities of tan(10x) (where the integral itself is defined). Hence their difference is effectively an additive constant, so the two answers represent the same family of antiderivatives up to an arbitrary constant.

Therefore the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates give the power‐series expansion as

Candidate 1 writes the coefficient as  
–1 + (–1)^{n+1}/2^{2n+2}; since 2^{2n+2}=4^{n+1}, this equals the coefficient in Candidate 2.  
The powers of x (x^{2n}) also match.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Key discrepancies:

1. Concave-down interval  
   • Candidate 1: (-∞, 0) and (0, 54/11) (excludes x = 0)  
   • Candidate 2: (-∞, 54/11) (includes x = 0)  
   Including the point where f'' = 0 is incorrect for an open concave-down interval, so the intervals differ.

2. Inflection point  
   • Candidate 1 supplies the full point (54/11, f(54/11)).  
   • Candidate 2 gives only x = 54/11, omitting the y-coordinate that the question asks for.  
   Hence Candidate 2’s answer is incomplete relative to the requirement.

Because at least one sub-answer differs/incomplete, the predictions are not equivalent.

The problem asks for two separate items:  
1. an exponential–decay formula,  
2. the number of half-lives until the mass reaches 8.3 g.

Candidate 1  
• Formula: \(A = 132.8\,e^{(\ln 0.5 / 2.045)\,t}\)  
• Half-lives: 4  

Candidate 2  
• Formula: \(N(t)=132.8\,e^{-0.3389\,t}\)  
• Half-lives: 4  

Check equivalence of the two formulas:

The constant used by candidate 1 equals
\[
\frac{\ln 0.5}{2.045}\approx -0.338947\ (\text{to six significant digits}).
\]

Candidate 2 uses \(-0.3389\), which to six significant digits is \(-0.338900\).  
Since \(-0.338947\) and \(-0.338900\) differ already at the fifth significant digit, Rule 4 declares them unequal.  

Although the “4 half-lives’’ part matches, the formula constants do not agree to the required six-digit precision. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates differ by the factor \(x/|x|=\operatorname{sgn}(x)\).  
Hence

• For \(x<0\): Candidate 1 gives \(+1/\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\) while Candidate 2 gives \(-1/\sqrt{1-x^{2}}\).

Because they do not coincide on the whole domain, the expressions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that, after algebraic simplification, differ only by the constant  
\(-\frac16\ln 3\):

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
\(-x^{2}+x+\frac16\ln|3x-2|-\frac12\ln|x|-\frac16\ln 3 + C_1\).

Candidate 2 is  
\(-x^{2}+x+\frac16\ln|3x-2|-\frac12\ln|x| + C_2\).

Since \(-\frac16\ln 3 + C_1\) and \(C_2\) differ only by an arbitrary constant, the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

The two antiderivatives can be compared by setting  

s = √(1 + x²).

Candidate 1:  
F₁ = s + ½ ln|(s − 1)/(s + 1)|.

Candidate 2 (rewritten):  
F₂ = s − ln((1 + s)/x)  
   = s − ln(s + 1) + ln x.

Compute the difference:

F₁ − F₂ = ½ ln(s − 1) − ½ ln(s + 1) + ln(s + 1) − ln x  
    = ½ [ln(s − 1) + ln(s + 1)] − ln x  
    = ½ ln[(s − 1)(s + 1)] − ln x  
    = ½ ln(x²) − ln x  
    = ln|x| − ln x.

For x > 0, ln|x| = ln x, so the difference is zero (a constant).  
For x < 0, ln x is not real while ln|x| is, so the two formulas no longer coincide; Candidate 2 is undefined in that region because it lacks the absolute value around x.

Since the original integral is defined for negative as well as positive x (x ≠ 0) but Candidate 2 only matches Candidate 1 on the restricted domain x > 0, the two answers are not fully equivalent.

Both expressions simplify to the same algebraic form.

Candidate 1:  
t = ln[( (T – T_s)/(T_0 – T_s) )^(–1/k)]  
  = (–1/k) ln[(T – T_s)/(T_0 – T_s)]

Candidate 2:  
t = (1/k) ln[(T_0 – T_s)/(T – T_s)]  
  = (1/k)(–ln[(T – T_s)/(T_0 – T_s)])  
  = (–1/k) ln[(T – T_s)/(T_0 – T_s)]

Since both reduce to the identical expression (–1/k) ln[(T – T_s)/(T_0 – T_s)], the two candidates are equivalent.

Since 33.6667 ≠ 33.6700 at six-significant-digit precision, the two predictions are not identical.

Both candidates give two answers, as required.

1. First derivative: both give e^t /(e^x + e^t) – identical.

2. With x = t^3:
   • Candidate 2 explicitly writes (3 t² e^{t³} + e^t)/(e^{t³} + e^t).
   • Candidate 1 writes (3 t² e^{t³} + e^t)/(e^t + e^x) but precedes it with “when x = t^3”.  
     Under that condition, e^x = e^{t³}, so the denominator e^t + e^x equals e^t + e^{t³}.  
     Hence the two expressions are algebraically the same.

Since every sub-answer of Candidate 1 is mathematically identical to the corresponding sub-answer of Candidate 2, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates give the antiderivative

2x ln(√(2 − x) + √(2 + x)) − x + 2 arcsin(x/2) + (constant).

The only difference is the sign and labeling of the arbitrary constant, which is irrelevant for an indefinite integral. Therefore the two answers are mathematically the same.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give

2x ln(√(2 − x)+√(2 + x)) + 2 arcsin(x/2) − x  

up to an additive constant (the symbols “C” appear with opposite signs, but any indefinite integral is defined only up to an arbitrary constant). Hence the two expressions differ only by a constant and represent the same antiderivative.

Both candidates list the two solutions −3 and 1 (Candidate 1 as “x = −3 or x = 1”, Candidate 2 as “answer 1: −3, answer 2: 1”).  
The question simply asks for the solutions, without specifying order.  
Thus the two answer sets are identical.

The two candidates give numerical answers.

• Candidate 1 evaluates to  
  2 / (0.3)³ × (0.7)⁴ / 4!  ≈ 0.741049 (six significant digits: 0.741049).

• Candidate 2 gives the number 0.741, which we write as 0.741000 for six significant digits.

Comparing 0.741049 and 0.741000, they differ at the 5th significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives differ by

ln│(√(x²+4)−2)/(2+√(x²+4))│  − ln│(√(x²+4)−2)/x│  
  = ln│x/(2+√(x²+4))│,

which is a function of x, not a constant.  
Since valid indefinite integrals can differ only by an additive constant, the two expressions are not equivalent.
The two antiderivatives differ, at most, by a constant:

Let  
A = √(x² + 4).

Candidate 1:  
I₁ = A + ln | (A − 2)/(A + 2) | + C.

Candidate 2:  
I₂ = A − 2 ln | (A + 2)/x | + C.

Compute the difference (omit C’s):

I₂ − I₁ = −2 ln | (A + 2)/x | − ln | (A − 2)/(A + 2) |  
            = −2[ln |A + 2| − ln |x|] − [ln |A − 2| − ln |A + 2|]  
            = −ln |A + 2| + 2 ln |x| − ln |A − 2|.

But (A − 2)(A + 2) = A² − 4 = x², so

−ln |A + 2| − ln |A − 2| + 2 ln |x| = −ln |x²| + 2 ln |x| = 0.

Thus I₂ − I₁ is identically zero; the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives (up to an overall constant).

Both expressions are algebraically identical because

ln(9/8) = −ln(8/9).

Hence

10 ln(9/8) = 10 (−ln(8/9)) = −10 ln(8/9).

So the two candidates provide the same numerical answer.

The two answers denote the same set of solutions:

• Candidate 1:   x = π · n  
• Candidate 2:   x = n π,  n ∈ ℤ

The expressions π n and n π are identical. Although Candidate 1 does not explicitly state “n is an integer,” that convention is universally assumed when listing trigonometric solutions with a parameter n. Hence no substantive difference exists between the two answers.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers describe the same set of solutions: all integer multiples of π.  
“π·n” and “nπ” are algebraically identical, and the conventional use of n in such contexts denotes an arbitrary integer. Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates both state that the solution set is all integer multiples of π.

• Candidate 1:  x = π·n  
• Candidate 2:  x = nπ  (with “n is any integer” explicitly said)

Writing “π·n” and “nπ” are just two ways of indicating the same product. In ordinary mathematical usage the symbol n in such a context denotes an arbitrary integer; Candidate 2 merely makes this explicit. Therefore the two expressions describe exactly the same set of x-values.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The two answers are not clearly the same.

• Candidate 2 explicitly states “10 %.”  
• Candidate 1 states “0.1” with no percent sign. Because the question asks for a percentage, “0.1” could reasonably be interpreted as either 0.1 % or as the decimal form 0.1 = 10 %. The lack of a percent sign therefore introduces ambiguity.

Per Rule 1, when an omitted unit leads to ambiguity, the answers are considered inequivalent.

• Candidate 2: ln | (1 + √(1 − x²)) / x | + C  
      = ln ((1 + √(1 − x²)) / |x|) + C  (since 1 + √(1 − x²) > 0)

Thus the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by the same arbitrary constant of integration, making them equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives two pieces of information (interval of convergence and a piece-wise sum), while Candidate 2 only supplies a single formula for the sum and no interval.  
Because the question explicitly asks for both the interval of convergence and the sum, omitting either piece violates Rule 2.  

In addition, the two sums are not even the same function on the endpoint \(x=1\):  
• Candidate 1 assigns \(S(1)=2\).  
• Candidate 2’s formula would give \(S(1)=2+\tfrac12=2.5\).

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value for the time:

• Candidate 1: 7/2 = 3.5 (units not explicitly written)  
• Candidate 2: 3.5 seconds

The problem asks for a time in seconds; interpreting the unitless 7/2 as seconds is natural and unambiguous here. Numerically, 3.5 and 3.5 match to six significant digits (3.50000). Hence, according to Rule 1 (unit consistency) and Rule 4 (numeric comparison), the two answers are equivalent.

Both expressions are antiderivatives of the integrand and they differ only by a constant:

1.  sec x + tan x = (1 + sin x)/cos x, so  
  ln|sec x + tan x| = ln|1 + sin x| − ln|cos x|.

2.  Candidate 1’s logarithmic term:
  −½ ln|(1 − sin x)/(1 + sin x)| = −½[ln|1 − sin x| − ln|1 + sin x|]  
                = −½ ln|1 − sin x| + ½ ln|1 + sin x|.

3.  Subtracting the two candidates’ results:
  (−½ ln|1 − sin x| + ½ ln|1 + sin x|) − (ln|1 + sin x| − ln|cos x|)  
  = −½[ln|1 − sin x| + ln|1 + sin x| − 2 ln|cos x|]  
  = −½[ln|(1 − sin x)(1 + sin x)| − ln|cos^2 x|]  
  = −½[ln|cos^2 x| − ln|cos^2 x|] = 0.

Hence Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 differ only by an overall constant (indeed, they are exactly equal up to the arbitrary integration constant). Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

These are identical numbers (0.0785714…) to all required significant digits.  
The extra expression Candidate 1 provides is additional detail, but the question asks only for the evaluation (single result), so this does not create a mismatch under Rule 2.

Hence the predictions are equivalent.

• Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4): Candidate 1 = 7.40550, Candidate 2 = 7.40550 → identical.

Both candidates can be rewritten in terms of  

B = 1 + 9/x²   (so that √B = √(9+x²)/|x| and B > 0 for every x ≠ 0).

Candidate 1  
   F₁(x) = √B [-B³/1701 + 2B²/1215 − B/729] + C  
        = B^{3/2}[-B²/1701 + 2B/1215 − 1/729] + C.

Candidate 2  
   F₂(x) = 1/243 [ -(9+x²)^{7/2}/(7x⁷) + 2(9+x²)^{5/2}/(5x⁵) − (9+x²)^{3/2}/(3x³) ] + C  
          = (|x|/x) B^{3/2}[-B²/1701 + 2B/1215 − 1/729] + C  
          = sgn(x) B^{3/2}[-B²/1701 + 2B/1215 − 1/729] + C.

Thus  

 F₂(x) = F₁(x) for x > 0,  
 F₂(x) = −F₁(x) + (constant) for x < 0.

Since the two expressions differ by a non-constant factor (a sign) on the negative x-axis, they are not the same antiderivative on the entire domain of the integrand.  
Therefore the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions both represent the complex number whose real part is \(-9/41\) and whose imaginary part is \(40/41\).  
In candidate 1 the imaginary part is written as \(\frac{40}{41}\cdot i\); in candidate 2 it is \(\frac{40}{41}i\). The “\(\cdot\)” is merely a multiplication symbol, so the two notations are mathematically identical.

Hence the candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates give the same intervals for “concave down’’ and the same inflection point, but they differ for “concave up’’:

• Candidate 1: concave up on (−2, 0) ∪ (0, ∞) — excludes x = 0.  
• Candidate 2: concave up on (−2, ∞) — includes x = 0.

Since the concave-up sets are not identical, the answers are not equivalent for sub-problem 1, so the overall predictions are not equivalent.
The question has three sub-parts (concave up interval(s), concave down interval(s), inflection point(s)).  
Both candidates give an answer for each sub-part, so we compare each one:

1. Concave-up set  
   • Candidate 1: (-2, 0) ∪ (0, ∞)  
   • Candidate 2: (-2, ∞)

   These differ at the single point x = 0. Candidate 2 includes 0, whereas Candidate 1 excludes it. Because the two sets are not identical, the two answers to sub-part 1 are not the same.

2. Concave-down set: both give (-∞, -2) – identical.  
3. Inflection point: both give (-2, 44) – identical.

Since at least one sub-answer (the concave-up interval) differs, Rule 2 states the overall answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of the form  
( A(x) ) √(x²+x+1) + (7/16) ln( x + 1/2 + √(x²+x+1) ) + C

Candidate 1: A(x)= (1/3)x² − (5/12)x − 1/24  
Candidate 2: A(x)= (8x² − 10x − 1)/24

Because  
(1/3)x² = 8x²/24, (−5/12)x = −10x/24, −1/24 = −1/24,  
the two A(x) expressions are identical: (8x² − 10x − 1)/24.

The logarithmic terms match as well; the only difference is that Candidate 1 places absolute-value bars around the argument. However the argument x + 1/2 + √(x² + x + 1) is strictly positive for all real x (√(x²+x+1) > |x+1/2|), so the absolute value is unnecessary and does not change the function except by an irrelevant constant. Therefore the two antiderivatives differ at most by a constant of integration.

Hence the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

The two antiderivatives contain exactly the same four kinds of terms:

1.  \(\frac{3}{2}\,3^{2/3}x^{2/3}\)  
   (Candidate 1: \(\frac{3\cdot3^{2/3}}{2}x^{2/3}\); Candidate 2: \(\frac{3}{2}\sqrt[3]{9x^2}= \frac{3}{2}3^{2/3}x^{2/3}\))

2.  \(-9\,3^{1/3}x^{1/3}\)  
   (Candidate 1: \(-9\cdot3^{1/3}x^{1/3}\); Candidate 2: \(-9\sqrt[3]{3x}= -9\cdot3^{1/3}x^{1/3}\))

3.  \(36\ln\!\left(4+3^{1/3}x^{1/3}\right)\)  
   (Candidate 1: \(36\ln|4+3^{1/3}x^{1/3}|\); Candidate 2: \(36\ln(\sqrt[3]{3x}+4)\).  
   Because \(\sqrt[3]{3x}=3^{1/3}x^{1/3}\), the logarithm arguments are identical up to an absolute-value sign, whose effect is only an additive constant.)

4.  \(3\arctan\!\Bigl(\frac{3^{1/6}}{2}x^{1/6}\Bigr)\)  
   (Candidate 1: \(3\arctan\bigl((3^{1/6}/2)x^{1/6}\bigr)\); Candidate 2: \(3\arctan\bigl(\sqrt[6]{3x}/2\bigr)=3\arctan\bigl((3^{1/6}/2)x^{1/6}\bigr)\).)

Both expressions differ, at most, by a constant of integration, which is already absorbed in the “\(C\)” each candidate includes. Therefore the two antiderivatives are mathematically the same.

We compare the two sets of solutions modulo 2π.

Candidate 1 gives

1. −π/2 + 2πn  →  residue 3π/2  
2. −2π/3 + 2πn →  residue 4π/3  
3.  2π/3 + 2πn →  residue 2π/3  
4.  (−1)ⁿ π/6 + πn  

 • n even ⇒ π/6 + 2πm  
 • n odd  ⇒ −π/6 + π(2m+1)=5π/6 + 2πm  

So Candidate 1 supplies the five distinct residues
π/6, 5π/6, 2π/3, 4π/3, 3π/2 (each with period 2π).

Candidate 2 lists exactly those five families:

π/6 + 2πk, 5π/6 + 2πk, 2π/3 + 2πk, 4π/3 + 2πk, 3π/2 + 2πk.

Thus every zero from Candidate 1 appears in Candidate 2 and vice-versa; no additional or missing solutions exist.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

The question asks for three distinct pieces of information.  
Both candidates give three answers, but they differ on sub-answer 2 (concave-down interval):

• Candidate 1: concave-down = (−∞, −2) and (−2, 0).  
  (Union is (−∞, 0) minus the single point −2.)

• Candidate 2: concave-down = (−∞, 0).

Candidate 2’s interval includes x = −2, whereas Candidate 1 explicitly excludes it.  
Since the two sets are not identical, sub-answer 2 differs, so by Rule 2 the overall predictions are not equivalent.

The first answer is given as a percentage (4.492 %), which equals 0.044 92 in decimal form.  
The second answer is given directly in decimal form as 0.044 9.

Expressing both to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 0.044 9200  
• Candidate 2 → 0.044 9000  

They differ at the fifth significant digit, so they do not match to six significant digits.  
Hence, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give the same Taylor expansion.

Candidate 1 writes the general term  
  2^{½-n} C(½,n) x^{2n}  
which is √2 C(½,n)/2^{n} x^{2n}.

Candidate 2 writes the series as  
  √2 (1 + x²/4 − x⁴/32 + x⁶/128 − …).  
The coefficients here are √2 C(½,n)/2^{n} for n = 0,1,2,3,… (checked for the first few terms).

Thus both candidates represent the same infinite series centred at 0; candidate 2 just lists the first few terms while candidate 1 gives the closed-form general term. They are equivalent.

The two candidates give the same formula for the solution set:

Candidate 1:  x = π/8 + (π k)/4  
Candidate 2:  x = π/8 + (π/4) k  for any integer k

The algebraic expression π/8 + (π k)/4 is identical to π/8 + (π/4) k.  
Although Candidate 2 explicitly states “for any integer k,” it is standard convention in such trigonometric-solution notation that k denotes an arbitrary integer; Candidate 1’s omission does not materially change the meaning.

Therefore, the two answers represent the same set of x-values.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give numerical coordinates.

Candidate 1: (0.8351, 0.6974)  → 0.835100 and 0.697400 to 6 significant digits  
Candidate 2: (0.835, 0.697)   → 0.835000 and 0.697000 to 6 significant digits

Because the values differ at the 4th–6th significant digits in both coordinates, Rule 4 says they are not the same result.

2. The same general rule for n ≥ 2: aₙ = n + 1.

Candidate 2 also explicitly states a₁ = 1 inside a piece-wise formula, while Candidate 1 already gave a₁ = 1 when listing the first six terms. Together with that initial value, Candidate 1’s formula fully specifies the same sequence for all n. Hence the two answers describe exactly the same sequence and fulfill both sub-requirements of the question.

Both candidates provide antiderivatives whose derivatives equal the given integrand  
\( \displaystyle \frac{4}{\cos^3(3x)\,\sin^2(3x)} \).

• Differentiating Candidate 2 explicitly gives exactly this integrand.  
• Differentiating Candidate 1, though more algebraically involved, also yields the same integrand (confirmed symbolically and by numerical check).  

Evaluating the two antiderivatives at a sample point (e.g., \(x=0.1\)) shows they differ only by a constant (≈ 0.001 due to rounding), so they represent the same antiderivative up to an additive constant.

Hence the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

          = ∑_{odd n} (1/n) sin(nx) = ∑_{k=1}^∞ sin[(2k−1)x]/(2k−1)

Because the coefficients for even n in Candidate 2 vanish, both series reduce to the same sum over odd harmonics with coefficient 1/(odd n). Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

The two expressions are not the same.

• Both have the same constant term, but  
• In the series term Candidate 1 uses cos(n x) and sin(n x), whereas Candidate 2 uses cos(n x / 2) and sin(n x / 2).  
  – This means the fundamental frequency in Candidate 1 is 1 (period 2π), while in Candidate 2 it is 1/2 (period 4π).  
  – Changing the summation index cannot convert one form into the other.

Because the harmonic arguments differ, the two Fourier series are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ in the trigonometric arguments of every non-constant term.

• Candidate 1 uses cos(n x) and sin(n x).  
• Candidate 2 uses cos(n x / 2) and sin(n x / 2).

Because the specified interval is (−2π, 2π), the standard Fourier basis has argument n x / 2 (period 4π). Candidate 2 follows this, whereas Candidate 1’s arguments correspond to period 2π (or, equivalently, omit all half-integer harmonics present in Candidate 2). Thus the two series represent different periodic functions.

Since their non-constant terms are not the same functions (and cannot be matched by a simple re-indexing over integers), the two candidates are not mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical answer.  
• Candidate 1: “θ = 2.84”  
• Candidate 2: “2.84”  

The question requests the angle in radians, rounded to two decimal places. Neither candidate explicitly writes “rad,” but the context makes radians implicit for both, so no unit conflict arises (Rule 1).  

Numerically, both values are 2.84 → 2.84000 when written to six significant digits, so they match exactly (Rule 4).  

There is only one required answer and both supply it (Rule 2). No detailed derivations are present (Rule 7).

Both candidates give a single Fourier‐series expression, but the numerical coefficients differ by a factor of 2:

• Constant term  
  – Candidate 1: (e^π – e^{-π}) / (4π)  
  – Candidate 2: (e^π – e^{-π}) / (2π)

• Cosine / sine coefficients  
  – Candidate 1: (e^π – e^{-π}) · [(-1)^n /(2π(1+n²))]  
  – Candidate 2: (e^π – e^{-π}) · [(-1)^n /(π(1+n²))]

Thus every coefficient in Candidate 1 is exactly half of the corresponding coefficient in Candidate 2, so the two series are not the same function.

For each of the three required answers we compare the two candidates:

1. Formula  
   • C1: C(t)=10.25 t + 20  
   • C2: C(t)=20 + 10.25 t  
   These are algebraically identical ⇒ equivalent.

2. Cost for 2 days 7 h  
   • C1: \$583.75  
   • C2: \$583.75  
   Same value and unit ⇒ equivalent.

3. Rental time for \$432.73  
   • C1: 40.26634146 h  
   • C2: 40.266 h  

   Expressing both to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):  
   • C1 → 40.2663  
   • C2 → 40.2660  

   The digits differ at the 6-significant-digit level, so the two numbers are not considered the same under the strict comparison rule.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

The individual values provided are:

• Candidate 1: 2/3 and –1/2  
• Candidate 2: 2/3 and –1/2

The numeric values are identical, and no unit issues arise. Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1: 1404 cos x − 2 x² cos x − 108 x sin x  
Candidate 2: −2 x² cos x − 108 x sin x + 1404 cos x

Both answers are antiderivatives that differ only by algebraic rearrangement:

1.  Candidate 1 simplifies to  
   E₁ = c/s • 8/15 + c/s³ • 4/15 + c/s⁵ • 1/5  + C  
   (with c = cos(x/3), s = sin(x/3)).

2.  Candidate 2 is  
   E₂ = c/s + (2/3) c³/s³ + (1/5) c⁵/s⁵ + C.  
   Re-expressing c³/s³ and c⁵/s⁵ using c² = 1 – s² gives exactly the same
   coefficients as in E₁:
        c³/s³ = c/s³ – c/s,  
        c⁵/s⁵ = c/s⁵ – 2 c/s³ + c/s,  
   leading to
        E₂ = c/s⁵ (1/5) + c/s³ (4/15) + c/s (8/15) + C = E₁.

Since they differ at most by an additive constant (absorbed in the + C), the two candidates represent the same antiderivative.

The question asks for TWO things  
1) the radius of convergence,  
2) a closed-form expression for the sum of the series.

Both candidates give a value for the radius ( R = ∞ ) and an explicit formula for the sum.

Compare the formulas for the sum (for x ≠ 0):

• Candidate 1: f(x)= [3 + 3e^x(x−1)] / x²  
• Candidate 2: f(x)= 3( x e^x − e^x + 1 ) / x²  
       = [3e^x(x−1) + 3] / x².

These are algebraically identical.

Candidate 1 also specifies the removable value at x=0 (3/2).  
Candidate 2 omits the separate piece, but the limit of its formula as x→0 is also 3/2, so no contradiction arises and the two answers describe the same function.

Hence for both required sub-answers the two candidates match.

Both candidates give:

1. Radius of convergence – ∞ (identical).

2. Sum of the series – for x ≠ 0 they both give
   3(eᵡ(x − 1)+1)/x², because candidate 1’s
   3/x² + (3x eᵡ − 3 eᵡ)/x² simplifies to the same expression used by candidate 2.

Candidate 1 additionally states the value at x = 0 (3/2), but this is exactly the limit of candidate 2’s formula as x→0, so no contradiction arises; candidate 2’s answer is simply the same formula without the explicit removable-singularity patch. Thus the two answers correspond to the same function and supply the same required information.

The two expressions differ by an absolute-value sign:

• Candidate 1: κ = 1 / [48 · |sin(t/2)|] (always non-negative)  
• Candidate 2: κ = 1 / [48 · sin(t/2)] (can be negative when sin(t/2)<0)

Curvature must be non-negative for all t, so the two formulas are not mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates describe the region in polar coordinates as
 r-interval: 0 ≤ r ≤ 4 cos θ

The difference lies in the θ-interval:

• Candidate 1: 3π/2 ≤ θ ≤ 5π/2  
  (= 270° to 450°, i.e. −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 after subtracting 2π)

• Candidate 2: 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2  
  (= 0° to 90°)

The circle (x–2)² + y² ≤ 4 requires −π/2 ≤ θ ≤ π/2 (quadrants IV and I).  
Candidate 1 covers exactly this full range (just shifted by 2π), while Candidate 2 covers only the upper half (quadrant I). Hence Candidate 2 omits half of the region.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives can be simplified to the same algebraic expression.

Candidate 1  
\[
-\frac{3\,(1+4\tan^{2}x)}{8\,\tan^{2}x\,(\tan^{2}x)^{1/3}}
     =-\frac{3+12\tan^{2}x}{8\,\tan^{8/3}x}
     =-\frac{3}{8}\tan^{-8/3}x-\frac{3}{2}\tan^{-2/3}x
     =-\frac{3}{8}\cot^{8/3}x-\frac{3}{2}\cot^{2/3}x + C .
\]

Candidate 2  
\[
-\frac{3}{8}\cot^{8/3}(x)-\frac{3}{2}\cot^{2/3}(x)+C .
\]

Since both simplify to the identical expression (up to the arbitrary constant of integration), the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivative expressions can be algebraically transformed into each other:

Candidate 1  
  \(-\dfrac{3\,[1+4\tan^2 x]}{8\,\tan^2 x\,\sqrt[3]{\tan^2 x}}\)

1.  \(\sqrt[3]{\tan^2 x}= \tan^{2/3}x\) ⇒ denominator = \(\tan^{8/3}x\).  
2.  Expression becomes \(-\dfrac{3}{8}\,(1+4\tan^2 x)\tan^{-8/3}x\).  
3.  Replace \(\tan x = 1/\cot x\):

  \(1+4\tan^2 x = 1+\dfrac{4}{\cot^2 x}= \dfrac{\cot^2 x+4}{\cot^2 x}\).

4.  Multiply out:

  \(-\dfrac{3}{8}\,\cot^{8/3}x\,\dfrac{\cot^2 x+4}{\cot^2 x} = -\dfrac{3}{8}\,\cot^{2/3}x(\cot^2 x+4)\)

   = \(-\dfrac{3}{8}\cot^{8/3}x - \dfrac{3}{2}\cot^{2/3}x\).

This is exactly Candidate 2.

Thus the two candidates differ only by algebraic rearrangement (and the arbitrary integration constant), making them equivalent.

Both candidates agree on the radius of convergence ( R = ∞ ).

For the sum:

• Candidate 1  
 S(x)=((x²−2x+2)eˣ−2)/x³ for x≠0, and S(0)=1/3.

• Candidate 2  
 S(x)=((x²−2x+2)eˣ−2)/x³ (no value given at x=0).

Thus the two answers coincide for x≠0, but Candidate 2 omits the required value at x=0, where the series does converge and equals 1/3. This missing piece means the sub-answer for the sum is not fully identical.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different integrals.

1. Candidate 1 lacks the factor ½ that appears in the standard polar‐area formula and it integrates only from 0 to arccos(3/4).  
2. Candidate 2 contains the factor ½ and integrates over the complementary interval arccos(3/4) to 2π - arccos(3/4).

Because the integrands are multiplied by different constants (1 vs. ½) and the limits of integration cover different angular regions, the two expressions cannot be algebraically equal. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: (5/4) π = 1.25 π ≈ 3.926991  
Candidate 2: (5/8) π = 0.625 π ≈ 1.963495

Comparing to six significant digits gives 3.92699 ≠ 1.96350, so the two results are different (rule 4).

Both candidates answer all five sub-questions, but Candidate 1 omits the units while Candidate 2 states them explicitly.

For several parts (especially 4 and 5) more than one unit could reasonably be used (e.g. “6000 kg” vs “6 metric tons”, or “10 lb 4 oz” vs “10.25 lb”).  Candidate 1’s omission therefore introduces ambiguity according to Rule 1 and Example 1-3, so the two sets of answers cannot be treated as the same.

Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give

I(x) = (1/√13) [ ln|A - √13| - ln|A + √13| ]  +  constant,

where A = x + 4 + √(x² + 2x + 5).

Candidate 1 writes it as
(1/√13)[ ln(√13 − A) − ln(A + √13) ] = (1/√13)[ ln(−(A − √13)) − ln(A + √13) ]
= (1/√13)[ ln|A − √13| − ln|A + √13| ] + (1/√13) ln(−1),

which differs from candidate 2 only by the additive constant (1/√13) ln(−1).  
Such a constant difference is absorbed into the arbitrary integration constant C.

Hence the two antiderivatives are mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 2: (1/√13) ln|[(x+4+√(x²+2x+5)−√13)/(x+4+√(x²+2x+5)+√13)]| + C₂

Note that

√13 − 4 − x − √(x²+2x+5) = −[x + 4 + √(x²+2x+5) − √13].

Hence the argument of the logarithm in Candidate 1 equals (−1) times the argument in Candidate 2, while the denominators are identical.  
Taking a logarithm, ln(−A) = ln A + ln(−1); ln(−1) is a constant (absorbed in the integration constant).  
Thus the two expressions differ only by an overall additive constant, which is permissible for indefinite integrals.

Therefore the two candidates are mathematically equivalent antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of  

3 x ln(√(2−x)+√(2+x))  − (3/2)x  + 3 arcsin(x/2)  

up to an additive constant.

• Candidate 2 writes this expression directly and adds “+ C”.

• Candidate 1 can be rewritten as  
  3 x ln(…) − (3/2)(C + x − 2 arcsin(x/2))  
  = 3 x ln(…) − (3/2)C − (3/2)x + 3 arcsin(x/2).

Since −(3/2)C is just another constant of integration, Candidate 1 differs from Candidate 2 only by an overall constant, which is permissible for an indefinite integral.

Therefore the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1 writes  
e^x = e^{-1}[1 + (x+1) + (x+1)^2/2! + (x+1)^3/3!] + e^{\xi}(x+1)^4/4!,

i.e. a 4-term Taylor polynomial about x = –1 with a remainder term.

Candidate 2 writes  
e^x = e^{-1} ∑_{n=0}^{∞} (x+1)^n / n!,

the full infinite Taylor series about x = –1.

Because candidate 1 stops at the 4-th power and represents all higher-order terms by a single remainder term (with factor e^{\xi} instead of e^{-1}), while candidate 2 gives every coefficient explicitly, the two expressions are not the same expansion. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give exactly the same answers for every sub-problem:

1. Missing x-coordinate: −√2 / 3  
2. Trig values:  
   • sin θ = √7 / 3  
   • cos θ = −√2 / 3  
   • tan θ = −√14 / 2

Since every component matches, the two predictions are equivalent.

The three sub-answers given by the candidates must match.

Sub-answer 1 (where the function is concave up)
• Candidate 1:  (−∞, −1) ∪ (−1, 0) ∪ (0, ∞)   (the two isolated points −1 and 0 are **excluded**)
• Candidate 2:  (−∞, ∞)  (the entire real line, therefore **including** −1 and 0)

These two sets differ by the two points x = −1 and x = 0.  
Because the second derivative of the given polynomial is 12 x² (x+1)², it equals 0 at x = −1 and x = 0; at those points the function is not (strictly) concave up. Hence Candidate 1 correctly omits them, while Candidate 2 incorrectly includes them.

Since sub-answer 1 is different, the complete answers are not identical, so the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give exactly the same antiderivative:

Candidate 1:   C + (3/√7) · arctan[ (1 + 2 tan x)/√7 ]

Candidate 2:   (3/√7) · arctan[ (2 tan x + 1)/√7 ] + C

The arguments of the arctan are identical, merely written with terms reversed, and both overall coefficients (3/√7) and the arbitrary constant C are the same. Hence the expressions are mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by algebraic rearrangement:

F(x) = Candidate 2 – Candidate 1  
      = (–3/128) sin 4x + (1/128) sin 12x + (1/32)(sin 4x)³.

Using sin 12x = 3 sin 4x – 4 sin³ 4x, this simplifies to 0.  
Therefore the two expressions are identical up to an additive constant, so the answers are equivalent.

The two expressions differ by

Δ(x) = Candidate 2 – Candidate 1  
      = 1/288 sin³(12x) – 1/96 sin(12x).

This is not a constant: its derivative is  
Δ′(x) = –(1/8) cos³(12x) ≠ 0 in general.

Hence the antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant, so the candidates are not equivalent.
