The answers must match for every one of the nine requested items.  
Item 6 (“Intervals where the function is decreasing”) is different:

• Candidate 1 lists two intervals: (0, ∞) and (−∞, 0).  
• Candidate 2 lists only (0, ∞).

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same value for part 1 (1/27 cm²).

For part 2:
• Candidate 1: 2.52 hours → interpreted numerically as 2.52000 (six-digit comparison).
• Candidate 2: 4 ln(2)/ln(3) hours ≈ 2.52372 hours.

Comparing to six significant digits (rule 4): 2.52000 ≠ 2.52372.  
Since one of the required sub-answers differs, the two overall answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives:

1. 1/27 cm²  
2. 2.52 hours (rounded to two decimals)

Candidate 2 gives:

1. 1/27 cm²  
2. 4 · ln(2)/ln(3) hours ≈ 2.523716 hours

For the first sub-answer both candidates match exactly (1/27 cm²).

For the second sub-answer, Rule 4 requires comparing numerical answers to 6 significant digits.  
• Candidate 1: 2.52 → 2.52000 (to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 2.523716 → 2.52372 (to 6 significant digits)

Since 2.52000 ≠ 2.52372, the second answers do not match to 6 significant digits. Therefore, according to the rules, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates provide answers for the two required sub-questions.  
For each sub-answer, the numerical values and units match exactly:

1) Area: 1/27 cm² (same fraction).  
2) Doubling time: 2.52 hours (same number, same unit).

Therefore the two sets of answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives a numerical expression whose value is approximately 0.741049.  
Candidate 2 states the value 0.741 (which, to six significant digits, is 0.741000).

Comparing the two to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 0.741049  
• Candidate 2: 0.741000  

They differ starting at the fifth significant digit, so the answers are not the same according to Rule 4.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives a numerical expression whose value is approximately  
(2 / 0.027) × (0.2401 / 24) ≈ 0.741049.

Candidate 2 states the value 0.741 (which is 0.741000 to six significant digits).

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 0.741049  
• Candidate 2: 0.741000  

They differ in the 5th–6th significant digits, so the two answers are not identical to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives
(2 / 0.3³) · 0.7⁴ / 4!  ≈ 0.741049 .

Candidate 2 states 0.741 (which is 0.741000 to six significant digits).

Comparing the two numbers to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.741049  
• Candidate 2: 0.741000  

They differ at the 5-th significant digit, so the two answers are not identical to 6 significant digits.

The problem asks for the complete solution set (all pairs (x,y) that satisfy the two equations).

• Candidate 1 gives a one-parameter family:  
  x = π/2 + π k, y = π/6 – π k, k ∈ ℤ.

• Candidate 2 gives only one specific pair:  
  x = π/2, y = π/6.

Although Candidate 2’s pair is included in Candidate 1’s set (when k = 0), Candidate 2 does not list the other infinitely many valid pairs. Hence the two answers are not the same solution set.

According to Rule 2, when a question requires multiple answers (here, the complete set), an answer that provides only a subset is not equivalent to one that provides the full set.

Both candidates provide the single value “2” as the zero of the function.  
• The question asks for all zeros; the function has just one zero, so one answer suffices.  
• Both answers specify the same numerical value (2) with no unit ambiguity.  

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The question requires four distinct outputs: formulas for area A(t) and circumference C(t), plus exact and approximate numerical values for both quantities at t = 3 h.  
Both candidates supply all required items, and their formulas and exact values are identical.  
However, their approximate numerical answers differ:

• Area at t = 3 h  
 Candidate 1: 95.03317777 → 6 significant digits: 95.0332  
 Candidate 2: 95.03 → 6 significant digits: 95.0300  
 Mismatch at the 5th significant digit.

• Circumference at t = 3 h  
 Candidate 1: 34.55751919 → 6 significant digits: 34.5575  
 Candidate 2: 34.56 → 6 significant digits: 34.5600  
 Mismatch at the 4th significant digit.

Rule 4 states the numbers must agree to six significant digits; they do not.  
Therefore the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
The question requires answers for four items, each with exact and approximate numerical values where requested.  

For every item both candidates supply an answer, but:

• Approximate area at t = 3 h  
 Candidate 1: 95.03317777  
 Candidate 2: 95.03  

• Approximate circumference at t = 3 h  
 Candidate 1: 34.55751919  
 Candidate 2: 34.56  

Using Rule 4, numerical answers must match to 6 significant digits to be considered the same.  
95.03317777 vs 95.030000 and 34.55751919 vs 34.560000 differ in the third decimal place, so they do not match to 6 significant digits.  

Because these sub-answers differ, the complete sets of predictions are not identical.
The two candidates give the same formulas and the same exact values, but their approximate numerical values differ.

Area at t = 3 h  
• Candidate 1: 95.03317777  
• Candidate 2: 95.03  (≈ 95.030000)  
These differ beyond the 6-significant-digit rule.

Circumference at t = 3 h  
• Candidate 1: 34.55751919  
• Candidate 2: 34.56  (≈ 34.560000)  
Again they differ at 6 significant digits.

Since at least one required sub-answer is not identical, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates claim that no unique solution exists: 

• Candidate 1 states “Price of the child’s ticket: None, Price of the adult ticket: None,” indicating that both prices are “None” (i.e., no solution).  
• Candidate 2 simply answers “None,” which, per the problem’s instruction (“If there is no solution or infinitely many solutions, write None”), likewise means there is no unique solution.

Thus they convey the same outcome; their answers are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The problem states that when there is no (or infinitely many) solution the output should be exactly “None”.  
• Candidate 2 gives exactly “None”.  
• Candidate 1, however, supplies two separate answers—“Price of the child’s ticket: None” and “Price of the adult ticket: None”.  
Thus Candidate 1 gives two answers where only one is expected. Under Rule 2, when the number of answers differs from what is required (and extra components are not explicitly requested), the responses are not equivalent.

The task requires two separate answers:  
1. the first ten Maclaurin‐series terms for ln(1+3x)  
2. an inequality bounding the 10-term remainder |R₁₀(x)|.

Comparison:

Sub-answer 1 (expansion)  
• Candidate 1 lists terms through (3x)^9/9 – only 9 non-zero terms.  
• Candidate 2 lists terms through (3x)^10/10 – the full 10 terms.  
Thus the two expansions are not identical; Candidate 1 is missing the 10th term.

Sub-answer 2 (remainder bound)  
• Candidate 1: |R₁₀(x)| < 3¹⁰/10 (a constant).  
• Candidate 2: |R₁₀(x)| ≤ 3¹¹ x¹¹ / 11 (depends on x).  
These inequalities are plainly different.

Because at least one of the required sub-answers differs, the two candidates’ overall answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates express an antiderivative of the same integrand; their two formulas differ only by an additive constant.  Hence they represent the same family of antiderivatives (the same result up to the arbitrary “+ C”).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

• Writing y = x ­– 5, Candidate 1’s integrand becomes   
 F₁(x) = –(2/√3) arctan( √(1–y²) /(√3 (y+1)) )

• With the same substitution and half-angle identities, Candidate 2’s expression simplifies to   
 F₂(x) = (2/√3) arctan( (2y/(1+√(1–y²)) + 1)/√3 )

A direct check shows
 arctan( √(1–y²)/(√3 (y+1)) ) + arctan( (2y/(1+√(1–y²)) + 1)/√3 ) = π/3
for every admissible y (i.e., for every x where the original integrand is defined).

Hence
 F₂(x) – F₁(x) = (2/√3)(π/3) = constant = 2π/(3√3),

so the two antiderivatives differ only by a constant. Because indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant, the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives of the same integrand.  

Let  

s = √[1 – (x – 5)²]      and    t = x – 4.  

Candidate 1 uses      I₁(x) = –(2/√3) arctan( s / (√3 t) ) + C₁.  
Rewrite it as I₁(x) = (2/√3) arctan( –s / (√3 t) ) + C₁.  

Candidate 2 uses      I₂(x) = (2/√3) arctan( (2t – 1 + s) / (√3(1 + s)) ) + C₂.  

For all x in the domain 4 < x < 6 one can verify
 arctan( (2t – 1 + s)/(√3(1 + s)) ) = arctan( –s/(√3 t) ) + π/3,  
so I₂(x) = I₁(x) + (2/√3)(π/3) = I₁(x) + constant.  

Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an additive constant, the two
candidates represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different Fourier series expressions:

• Candidate 1 has only a constant term π plus sine terms −2∑sin(n x/2)/n (no cosine terms).

• Candidate 2 has a constant term π, sine terms 4(−1)^{n+1}/n sin(n x/4), and additional cosine terms −(8/π)(for odd n) cos(n x/4).

Evaluating at x = 0 illustrates the discrepancy:

– Candidate 1: π − 2∑_{n}0 = π.  
– Candidate 2: π − (8/π)∑_{odd n}1/n² = π − (8/π)(π²/8) = 0.

Since the two series do not match even at one point, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give identical expressions for velocity v(t) and acceleration a(t).  
However, for the speeding-up / slowing-down intervals:

• Candidate 1 (implicitly for t > 0)  
 – speeds up: (1, √3)  
 – slows down: (0, 1) and (√3, ∞)

• Candidate 2 (for all real t)  
 – speeds up: (−∞, −√3), (−1, 0), (1, √3)  
 – slows down: (−√3, −1), (0, 1), (√3, ∞)

Candidate 1 omits all negative-time intervals that Candidate 2 includes. Unless the problem explicitly restricts time to non-negative values (which it does not), Candidate 1’s list is incomplete and therefore different from Candidate 2’s. Hence the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give identical velocity and acceleration formulas.  
For the speeding-up / slowing-down intervals they differ:  

• Candidate 1 lists slowing down on (0, 1) and omits t = 0.  
• Candidate 2 lists slowing down on [0, 1), explicitly including t = 0.

Because the required interval endpoints differ, the answers are not exactly the same.  
Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same formulas for velocity and acceleration, but their answers for the speeding-up / slowing-down intervals differ: Candidate 1 lists only positive-time intervals ((1, √3) for speeding up; (0, 1) and (√3, ∞) for slowing down), whereas Candidate 2 includes additional negative-time intervals and a different overall partition. Because at least one sub-answer (the interval classification) is not the same, the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: 5.0658 → 5.06580 (padding with a zero to reach 6 significant digits)

Both antiderivatives can be simplified and compared.

1.  Candidate 1  
   (1/(32 √2)) [16 √(4x²+2x−5) − 24 ln|2 + 4 √(4x²+2x−5) + 8x|] + C

   = (1/4) √(8x²+4x−10) − (3√2/8) ln|2 + 4 √(4x²+2x−5) + 8x| + C.

   Noting √(4x²+2x−5) = √(8x²+4x−10)/(√2) and defining  
   s = √(8x²+4x−10), the logarithm’s argument becomes

      2 + 4 √(4x²+2x−5) + 8x
    = 2 + 2√2 s + 8x
    = 2(4x + 1 + √2 s)
    = 8 ( x + 1/4 + s/(2√2) ).

   Hence ln|…| = ln|8| + ln|x + 1/4 + s/(2√2)|.

2.  Candidate 2  
   (1/4) √(8x²+4x−10) − (3√2/8) ln|x + 1/4 + √(8x²+4x−10)/(2√2)| + C.

The first (radical) terms are identical.  
The logarithmic terms differ only by ln 8, a constant; multiplying by the common coefficient yields an additive constant, which is absorbed into the arbitrary constant C of an indefinite integral.

Therefore the two expressions differ at most by a constant and represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Candidate 1 presents them in an unsimplified fractional form (2·x³/6 = x³/3 and 16·x⁵/120 = 2x⁵/15) and then adds “+ …”, while Candidate 2 gives the simplified coefficients. The terms themselves are identical, so the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical value of 0.1 but does not attach the percent sign.  
Candidate 2 explicitly states 10 %.

If Candidate 1’s “0.1” is interpreted as a percentage, it would mean 0.1 %, which is 100 times smaller than 10 %.  
If instead one tries to interpret “0.1” as the decimal form of 10 %, Candidate 1 should still have indicated units or the percent sign; the omission creates genuine ambiguity because the problem explicitly asks for a percentage.

Because the two answers differ by a factor of 100 (0.1 % vs 10 %) and the unit omission in Candidate 1 makes the answer ambiguous, the two responses cannot be considered equivalent under Rule 1.

The two candidates differ inside the logarithm:

• Candidate 1: ln((1 + √(1 − x²)) / |x|) + C  
• Candidate 2: ln((1 + √(1 − x²)) / x) + C

Because Candidate 1 uses |x| while Candidate 2 uses x, they coincide only when x > 0. For x < 0, Candidate 1 remains real-valued, whereas Candidate 2 involves ln of a negative argument and is not real (or is undefined in the real context). Therefore, as real antiderivatives on the full domain (x ≠ 0, |x|<1), the two expressions are not equivalent.

The question asks for five unit-rates, each requiring both a number and its associated units.  
Comparing the two candidates:

1. Both give “6 per hour” (Candidate 2 writes 6.00 per hour). Units match → equivalent.  
2. Candidate 1: “4 per person” (object unit missing). Candidate 2: “4 slices per person”.  
3. Candidate 1: “6 per hour” (object unit missing). Candidate 2: “6 votes per hour”.  
4. Candidate 1: “500 per hour” (distance unit missing). Candidate 2: “500 km per hour”.  
5. Candidate 1: “9 per minute” (object unit missing). Candidate 2: “9 bags per minute”.

For items 2–5 Candidate 1 omits the numerator units that Candidate 2 includes (“slices”, “votes”, “km”, “bags”).  
Rule 1 states that if a required unit is omitted and multiple reasonable units could exist, the answers are considered inequivalent. In particular, for item 4 “500 per hour” is ambiguous (km, miles, meters, etc.), so the two answers are not the same.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the entire multi-part answer set is not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for five unit-rate answers, each with its own specific unit (dollars per hour, slices per person, votes per hour, km per hour, bags per minute).

Candidate 2 supplies the numerical values *and* explicitly states every required unit.

Candidate 1 gives the same numerical values, but for items 2–5 omits the specific units (“slices,” “votes,” “km,” “bags”).  
According to Rule 1, when omission of a unit introduces ambiguity, the answers are not considered equivalent. Because multiple kinds of quantities are involved, failing to name the unit makes Candidate 1’s responses ambiguous.

Therefore the two sets of answers are not equivalent.
The question asks for a unit rate for each of five items, so each answer should include both a numerical value and the appropriate units.

Comparison item-by-item:

1. 6 per hour  vs. 6 dollars per hour  
   – Candidate 1 omits the word “dollars”; Candidate 2 specifies “dollars”.

2. 4 per person vs. 4 slices per person  
   – Candidate 1 omits the numerator unit “slices”.

3. 6 per hour  vs. 6 votes per hour  
   – Candidate 1 omits the numerator unit “votes”.

4. 500 per hour vs. 500 km per hour  
   – Candidate 1 omits the numerator unit “km”.

5. 9 per minute vs. 9 bags per minute  
   – Candidate 1 omits the numerator unit “bags”.

Per Rule 1, omitting a unit that is part of the required answer makes the response ambiguous; per Rule 2, any discrepancy in any sub-answer means the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.
The question requires five unit-rate answers, each including both the numerical value and the appropriate unit(s).

Comparison of each sub-answer:

1. Candidate 1: “6 per hour” (no currency)  
   Candidate 2: “6.00 per hour” (also no currency)  
   → Essentially the same.

2. Candidate 1: “4 per person” (does not say “slices”)  
   Candidate 2: “4 slices per person”  
   → Candidate 1 omits the word “slices.”

3. Candidate 1: “6 per hour” (omits “votes”)  
   Candidate 2: “6 votes per hour”  
   → Candidate 1 omits the word “votes.”

4. Candidate 1: “500 per hour” (omits “km”)  
   Candidate 2: “500 km per hour”  
   → Candidate 1 omits the unit “km.”

5. Candidate 1: “9 per minute” (omits “bags”)  
   Candidate 2: “9 bags per minute”  
   → Candidate 1 omits the word “bags.”

Because Candidate 1 repeatedly omits key units that appear in Candidate 2’s answers, the two sets of answers are not identical. Under Rule 1 and Rule 2, these omissions create ambiguities and constitute discrepancies between the candidates.

Both antiderivatives differ only by rewriting cot(4x) in terms of tan(4x):

1/cotⁿ(4x) = tanⁿ(4x)  
−ln|cot(4x)| = ln|tan(4x)|.

After distributing the factor 3/2 in Candidate 1, every algebraic and logarithmic term exactly matches the corresponding term in Candidate 2. Any remaining discrepancy is just an additive constant of integration, which is allowed.

The numeric values match exactly (3.50000 when expressed to six significant digits).  
The problem’s context clearly demands time in seconds, and “7/2” can only reasonably be interpreted as seconds here, so the lack of an explicit unit in Candidate 1 does not create real ambiguity.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of  

∫ sin⁴x / cos x dx.

Compare their logarithmic parts:

1. Candidate 1:  −½ ln|(1−sin x)/(1+sin x)|
   = ½ ln|1+sin x| − ½ ln|1−sin x|.

2. Candidate 2:  ln|sec x + tan x|
   = ln|(1+sin x)/cos x|
   = ln|1+sin x| − ln|cos x|
   = ln|1+sin x| − ½ ln|1−sin x| − ½ ln|1+sin x|
   = ½ ln|1+sin x| − ½ ln|1−sin x|.

Thus the two logarithmic expressions are identical, hence the complete antiderivatives differ only by an additive constant. They are mathematically equivalent answers.

The two expressions would be equivalent only if their difference were a constant (i.e., if their derivatives were identical).

Derivative of Candidate 1:
d/dx[ −½ ln|(1−sin x)/(1+sin x)| − ⅓ sin³x − sin x ]
= 1/ cos x − cos x − sin²x cos x.

Derivative of Candidate 2:
d/dx[ −ln|cos x| + ½ cos²x ]
= sin³x / cos x.

These two derivatives are obviously not the same (they differ by
(1 − sin³x)/cos x − cos x(1 + sin²x)), so the two antiderivatives cannot differ only by a constant. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

             = (1/2)(a^{x}) – (1/2)(a^{-x})
             = (a^{x} – a^{-x})/2

Candidate 2 is already (a^{x} – a^{-x})/2.

Since both simplify to the same formula, the two candidates are mathematically identical.

Both answers are antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

1. Rewrite Candidate 1:
   −(1/10)cot⁴(4x) − (2/15)cot⁶(4x) − (1/20)cot⁸(4x)

   Replace cot with cos/sin and expand using cos²(4x)=1−sin²(4x).  
   After collecting terms this becomes

   (1/15) sin⁻⁶(4x) − (1/20) sin⁻⁸(4x) − 1/60.

2. Candidate 2 is
   (4 sin²(4x) − 3)/(60 sin⁸(4x))
   = (1/15) sin⁻⁶(4x) − (1/20) sin⁻⁸(4x).

Hence Candidate 1 = Candidate 2 − 1/60.  
Because indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant, the two expressions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

1. Candidate 1 simplifies to
   −(1/10) cot⁴(4x) − (2/15) cot⁶(4x) − (1/20) cot⁸(4x) + C₁.

2. Candidate 2 can be rewritten using csc²(4x)=1+cot²(4x):

   (1/15)csc⁶(4x) − (1/20)csc⁸(4x)
   = −(1/10) cot⁴(4x) − (2/15) cot⁶(4x) − (1/20) cot⁸(4x) + 1/60.

   The extra 1/60 is just a constant, which can be absorbed into the integration constant C.

Since antiderivatives are considered equivalent up to an arbitrary constant, the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The antiderivatives given by the two candidates are not the same (they do not differ merely by an additive constant).  
A direct algebraic comparison shows that Candidate 1’s result contains an extra −(sin t)⁸–¹·sin⁸(4x) term proportional to sin⁴(4x) that is absent from Candidate 2’s expression, so the two formulas give different values at different points. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The zeros given by the two candidates are

Candidate 1: 1, i √(5/2), –i √(5/2)

Candidate 2: 1, (i √10)/2, –(i √10)/2

Since 
√(5/2) = √5 / √2 = √(5·2) / 2 = √10 / 2,

we have i √(5/2) = (i √10)/2 and likewise for the negative counterpart. Thus every root in Candidate 1 matches exactly with a root in Candidate 2, and both give the same set {1, (i √10)/2, –(i √10)/2}. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for the (pair of) consecutive even numbers whose product is 624.  
Candidate 1 lists four numbers (24, 26, –24, –26), i.e. two possible pairs.  
Candidate 2 lists only one pair (24 and 26).

Because the two candidates give different sets of answers—Candidate 1 adds the negative pair while Candidate 2 does not—their responses are not identical. Under Rule 3 (different lists of numbers) and Rule 2 (different number of answers relative to what each candidate interprets as required), the answers are considered inequivalent.
Candidate 1 lists four numbers: 24, 26, −24, and −26, implicitly giving both possible pairs of consecutive even numbers (24, 26) and (−24, −26).

Candidate 2 gives only one pair: 24 and 26.

Because the problem does not restrict the numbers to be positive, there are indeed two valid pairs. Candidate 1 supplies both, while Candidate 2 supplies only one. Hence the two candidates do not give the same set of answers.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 lists four values: 24, 26, –24, –26, i.e. both the positive and negative pairs of consecutive even numbers whose product is 624.  
Candidate 2 lists only the positive pair: 24 and 26.

Since the question asks for the numbers (plural) whose product is 624, Candidate 1 supplies two distinct pairs while Candidate 2 supplies only one pair. The sets of answers therefore differ: Candidate 2 omits –24 and –26 that Candidate 1 includes.

Hence, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the numerical answer 7.4055, which contains only 5 significant digits.  
Rule 4 requires comparing the numbers out to 6 significant digits; if they do not match to 6 significant digits, the answers must be deemed different.  
Because neither candidate supplies a 6-digit value, we cannot verify equality at that precision, so they fail the rule-4 requirement.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives are not the same.  
After rewriting candidate 1’s expressions in terms of the same radical that appears in candidate 2, their formulas agree for x > 0, but for x < 0 the two results differ by terms that depend on x (not by a constant). Numerical checks (e.g., x = −1, x = −2) show the difference changes with x, so it is not just a constant offset. Therefore the answers are inequivalent.

The two antiderivatives are not the same.

1.  The square-root terms differ:  
   • Candidate 1 contains √(5x² – 2x + 1)/|x|,  
   • Candidate 2 contains √(5x² – 2x + 1)/x.  
   These coincide only for x > 0; for x < 0 they differ by a sign, so their difference is not a constant on any domain containing negative x.

2.  The logarithmic arguments are also different.  Even if we restrict to x > 0,  
   ln|1/x + √(…) – 1| (Candidate 1)  
   is not equal to ln[(√(…) + 1 – x)/x] (Candidate 2) up to an additive constant; their ratio depends on x.

Because the two expressions differ by more than an additive constant, the candidates are inequivalent.

Both candidates give closed-form antiderivatives, but their expressions differ by a constant, non-trivial scale factor.

•  Rewrite candidate 1’s terms in the form (9+x²)^{n+1/2}/x^{2n+1}.  
  – Coefficients obtained:  
    n=1: −1/729, n=2: 2/1215, n=3: −1/1701.

•  Candidate 2’s corresponding coefficients are  
    n=1: −1/81, n=2: 2/135, n=3: −1/189.

Each coefficient of candidate 2 is exactly 9 times the corresponding coefficient of candidate 1.  Numerical evaluation at, say, x=1 confirms that candidate 2’s value is 9 times candidate 1’s value (up to the integration constant).  
Therefore the two antiderivatives are not the same (not even up to an additive constant); they differ by a multiplicative factor.

Hence the two candidates are inequivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives can be rewritten in the same basis

Candidate 1
F₁(x)=C−(1/1701)(9+x²)^{7/2}/x⁷ +(2/1215)(9+x²)^{5/2}/x⁵ −(1/729)(9+x²)^{3/2}/x³

Candidate 2
F₂(x)=C−(3/7)(9+x²)^{7/2}/x⁷ + (6/5)(9+x²)^{5/2}/x⁵ − (9+x²)^{3/2}/x³

The coefficients of the corresponding terms ( (9+x²)^{7/2}/x⁷ , (9+x²)^{5/2}/x⁵ , (9+x²)^{3/2}/x³ ) are

•  F₁ :  −1/1701,  +2/1215,  −1/729  
•  F₂ :  −3/7,      +6/5,      −1

These coefficients are clearly different, so F₁ and F₂ cannot differ only by an additive constant. Therefore the two expressions are not equivalent antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives coincide for x > 0, but for x < 0 they differ in sign (because candidate 1 involves |x| implicitly, whereas candidate 2 has plain odd powers of x in the denominators).  
Since the two expressions are not the same function (they give different values for negative x) and hence cannot differ only by an additive constant, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s y–coordinate contains √(m²) = |m|, so its points are  
(± 2/√(1+m²), ± 2|m|/√(1+m²)) with the same sign chosen for both coordinates.  
Candidate 2 gives (± 2/√(1+m²), ± 2m/√(1+m²)).  

For m < 0, |m| = –m, so Candidate 1’s y–coordinate is 2|m|/√(1+m²) = –2m/√(1+m²), whose sign is opposite to Candidate 2’s value 2m/√(1+m²). Therefore the two candidates do not describe the same set of points (they coincide only when m ≥ 0).  

Hence the answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 expresses the y–coordinate as 2 |m| / √(1+m²), whereas Candidate 2 uses 2 m / √(1+m²).  
For m ≥ 0, |m| = m and the two sets coincide, but for m < 0 they differ in sign: Candidate 1’s points no longer satisfy the line y = m x, while Candidate 2’s points do.  
Because the answers disagree for negative slopes, the two candidates are not mathematically identical.

Candidate 1’s coordinates use the expression  
 √(4 m² / (1 + m²)) = 2|m| / √(1 + m²),  
so the first listed point is ( 2/√(1+m²), + 2|m|/√(1+m²) ).  
For m < 0 this gives a positive y–coordinate, whereas Candidate 2’s corresponding point is ( 2/√(1+m²), 2m/√(1+m²) ), which is negative when m < 0.

Thus, except when m ≥ 0 (where |m| = m), the two candidates describe different points; the formulas are not generally identical.

The two antiderivatives must differ only by a constant to be equivalent.  
Write each candidate more uniformly:

Candidate 1  
= ⅙ sin³(2x) + ½ sin(2x) − ¼ ln|(1+sin 2x)/(1−sin 2x)| + C₁

Candidate 2  
= sin(2x) − ⅛ sin(4x) − ½ x − ½ ln|sec 2x + tan 2x| + C₂  
   = sin(2x) − ⅛ sin(4x) − ½ x − ½ ln|1+sin 2x| + ½ ln|cos 2x| + C₂

Compute the difference D(x)=Candidate 2−Candidate 1 (constants absorbed):

D(x)= ⅜ sin 2x − ⅛ sin 4x + 1/24 sin 6x − ½ x  
      −¼ ln|1+sin 2x| + ½ ln|cos 2x| − ¼ ln|1−sin 2x| + constant.

Differentiate D(x):

D′(x)= ¾ cos 2x − ½ cos 4x + ¼ cos 6x − ½  
      = cos²2x ( cos 2x − 1 ).

This derivative is not identically zero (e.g., at x = π/3 it equals −3/8), so D(x) is not a constant. Hence the two expressions are not the same antiderivative.

The two antiderivatives can be simplified and compared:

Candidate 1  
= C + ¼[ln(1+tan x)+ln|cos x|] – ¼(1+tan x)cos²x  
  •  ln(1+tan x)+ln|cos x| = ln|cos x|(1+tan x)  
     = ln|cos x|(1+sin x/cos x) = ln|sin x+cos x| (difference is only an absolute-value factor, contributing at most a constant).  
  •  (1+tan x)cos²x = cos²x + sin x cos x.

So Candidate 1 becomes  
  C – ¼(cos²x + sin x cos x) + ¼ ln|sin x+cos x|.

Candidate 2  
= ¼ sin²x – ¼ sin x cos x + ¼ ln|sin x+cos x| + C.

Difference (Candidate 1 – Candidate 2):  
= –¼(cos²x + sin x cos x) – [¼ sin²x – ¼ sin x cos x]  
= –¼(cos²x + sin²x)  
= –¼ (a pure constant).

Since indefinite integrals are allowed to differ by an arbitrary constant, the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

The two derivatives multiply the common factor y by different coefficient expressions.

• Candidate 2’s coefficient = 5/4 + 5/(12) − 1/20 = 1.61667.

Because these values (and the underlying expressions) differ, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the antiderivative, up to an additive constant, in the form  

(6x)^{2/3}  − 5(6x)^{1/3}  + 5 ln(1 + (6x)^{1/3})  − 6 arctan((6x)^{1/6}) + C.

Candidate 1 writes the powers as (√[6]{6x})⁴ and (√[6]{6x})², which equal (6x)^{2/3} and (6x)^{1/3}, respectively, and includes an absolute‐value sign in the logarithm. Because the domain of the integral requires x > 0 (to keep the real sixth root), 1 + (6x)^{1/3} is already positive, so the absolute value does not change the expression except by a constant. Hence the two answers differ only by an immaterial constant and are mathematically equivalent antiderivatives.

Both candidates give the antiderivative

(6x)^{2/3} − 5(6x)^{1/3} + 5 ln(1+ (6x)^{1/3}) − 6 arctan((6x)^{1/6}) + C

up to the harmless detail that Candidate 1 writes the logarithm with an absolute-value sign.  
Because the integrand is only real for x ≥ 0 (due to the sixth root), the argument 1+(6x)^{1/3} is always positive, so ln|…| = ln(…) in the domain of definition. Hence the two results differ at most by an additive constant and are mathematically equivalent as antiderivatives.

the only differences being (i) Candidate 1 rewrites the powers using the sixth-root notation, and (ii) Candidate 1 places an absolute-value bar in the logarithm (which merely changes the result by an additive constant on domains where the argument can change sign). Thus the two expressions differ, at most, by an overall additive constant—the freedom allowed in an indefinite integral. Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates supply all three required items, so we compare each one.

   These are not the same set: Candidate 2 includes x = 0 while Candidate 1 excludes it.

2. Concave-down interval
   • Both give  (-∞, -2)  — identical.

3. Point of inflection
   • Both give  (-2, 44)  — identical.

The two antiderivatives are clearly written in very different forms.  
When we differentiate candidate 2 we obtain

F₂′(x)=3e^{4x}-\dfrac{3e^{8x}}{\sqrt{1+e^{8x}}}+ \dfrac{3e^{8x}}{\sqrt{1+e^{8x}}\bigl(1+\sqrt{1+e^{8x}}\bigr)}-3,

which, except at some special points (e.g. x = 0), is NOT equal to the integrand  
−3 / (e^{4x}+√(1+e^{8x})).  
For instance, at x = 1 the integrand equals −0.02747…, whereas F₂′(1)=−0.0560…, so candidate 2 is not a correct antiderivative.

Because candidate 1 produces a different expression (and in fact its derivative equals the integrand), the two candidates cannot differ only by an additive constant. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidate antiderivatives differentiate to the same integrand  

d/dx [Candidate 1] = −3 / (e^{4x} + √(1 + e^{8x}))  
d/dx [Candidate 2] = −3 / (e^{4x} + √(1 + e^{8x}))

Hence their difference has zero derivative, so it is a constant.

Candidate 1 writes this with inequalities; Candidate 2 writes it in set/interval notation. These convey the same set of x-values, so the answers are equivalent.
Both candidates give the family of intervals

Aₖ = [−π/6 + 2πk , 7π/6 + 2πk]      (k ∈ ℤ)

               Bₖ = [11π/6 + 2πk , 2π + 2πk].

But for every k,  
Bₖ = [2π(k+1) − π/6 , 2π(k+1)] ⊆ A_{k+1}.  
Hence every Bₖ is already contained in some A interval.

Therefore ⋃ₖ Aₖ and ⋃ₖ (Aₖ ∪ Bₖ) describe exactly the same set of real numbers.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by algebraic/trigonometric identities and the arbitrary constant of integration:

1. Candidate 1:

2. Candidate 2: 
   (1/4)·sec(2x)tan(2x)  +  (1/4)·ln|sec(2x)+tan(2x)|  +  C  

• sec(2x)tan(2x) = sin(2x)/cos²(2x), so the first terms are identical.  
• Using the identity secθ + tanθ = tan(π/4 + θ/2), with θ = 2x, we have
  sec(2x) + tan(2x) = tan(x + π/4), making the logarithmic terms identical as well (up to an additive constant that can be absorbed into C).

Therefore the two antiderivatives are the same (up to the constant of integration).

Candidate 1:  
• Minimum = 1  
• Maximum = 9  

Candidate 2:  
• Minimum = 9  
• Maximum = “no maximum”  

The answers differ on both required parts. Therefore, they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 lists four second-order partial derivatives:  
fₓₓ, fₓᵧ, fᵧₓ, and fᵧᵧ.

Candidate 2 lists only three:  
fₓₓ, fₓᵧ, and fᵧᵧ (no explicit fᵧₓ).

Because the problem statement “Calculate the second-order partial derivatives” conventionally requires all of them (fₓₓ, fₓᵧ, fᵧₓ, fᵧᵧ), Candidate 2 provides fewer answers than required, while Candidate 1 provides all.  
According to Rule 2, when one candidate omits a required sub-answer, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Hence the two candidates’ predictions are NOT equivalent.

The two candidates give antiderivatives that differ by more than an additive constant.

• Candidate 1 has 36 ln|4+∛(3x)| while Candidate 2 has 39 ln|4+∛(3x)|, a difference of 3 ln|…| which is x-dependent.

• Candidate 1 contains an extra term 3 arctan((3^{1/6}/2)x^{1/6}), absent in Candidate 2.

Because the discrepancy 3 arctan((…)) − 3 ln|…| is not a constant, the two expressions are not equivalent antiderivatives.

The two antiderivatives differ by a factor of 2 multiplying the same logarithmic function:

• Candidate 1: ¼ ln( … ) + C  
• Candidate 2: ½ ln( … ) + C

Since the additional ¼ ln( … ) difference depends on x, it cannot be absorbed into the arbitrary constant C. Hence the two expressions are not the same antiderivative.

The two expressions are not the same.

• Candidate 1 is written in terms of the harmonics cos(k x); this corresponds to a 2π-periodic expansion, which matches the 2π period of |sin(x/2)|/2.  
  Coefficients: a₀ = 1/π and a_k = −2 / [π(4k² − 1)] for k ≥ 1.

• Candidate 2 is written in terms of cos(n x / 2).  
  – When n is even (n = 2k) the term becomes cos(k x) with coefficient −2 / [π(4k² − 1)], which matches Candidate 1.  
  – But Candidate 2 also includes all odd n. Those give cos((2k+1)x/2), which are half-integer harmonics that would break 2π periodicity unless their coefficients were zero. In Candidate 2 the formula assigns non-zero values for every odd n (and is even undefined at n = 1), so these extra terms do not cancel out.

Because Candidate 2 contains additional non-zero terms that are absent from Candidate 1, the two series are not the same.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 differ in the coefficient of the sine terms:

• Candidate 1 coefficient for sin(nx/2):  (e^{2π} − e^{−2π})/π · n(−1)ⁿ /(4+n²)

• Candidate 2 coefficient for sin(nx/2):  (e^{2π} − e^{−2π})/π · 2n(−1)ⁿ /(4+n²)

Candidate 2’s sine coefficient is twice that of Candidate 1, while all other parts are the same.  
Therefore the two Fourier series are not identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give the same coefficients for all cosine and sine terms, but their constant terms differ:

• Candidate 1 constant term: (e^{2π} − e^{−2π}) / (4π)  
• Candidate 2 constant term: (e^{2π} − e^{−2π}) / (2π)

Since the constant term (the a₀/2 coefficient) is part of the Fourier series and it is not the same in the two answers, the series are not identical.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of the same integrand.

• Rewrite Candidate 2 with cot in terms of sin:

 csc² = 1 + cot²  
 csc⁶ = (1 + cot²)³ = 1 + 3 cot² + 3 cot⁴ + cot⁶  
 csc⁸ = (1 + cot²)⁴ = 1 + 4 cot² + 6 cot⁴ + 4 cot⁶ + cot⁸

Candidate 2:
 −1/108 csc⁸ + 1/81 csc⁶  
 = −1/108(1 + 4 cot² + 6 cot⁴ + 4 cot⁶ + cot⁸) + 1/81(1 + 3 cot² + 3 cot⁴ + cot⁶)  
 = −1/108 cot⁸ − 2/81 cot⁶ − 1/54 cot⁴ + 1/324 (+ constant)

Candidate 1:
 −1/108 cot⁸ − 2/81 cot⁶ − 1/54 cot⁴ (+ constant)

Thus Candidate 2 differs from Candidate 1 only by the additional constant 1/324, which is absorbed into the arbitrary constant of integration.

Therefore, the two answers are mathematically equivalent up to an additive constant.

Both expressions contain the same algebraic part  
 (x – 5) √[(x+1)/(x–1)]

Their logarithmic parts differ by

 6 ln(√(x+1)+√(x–1)) − [–3 ln|(√(x–1)−√(x+1))/(√(x–1)+√(x+1))|]  
 = 3 ln(√(x+1)+√(x–1)) + 3 ln|√(x–1)−√(x+1)|

 = 3 ln| (x–1) − (x+1) |  
 = 3 ln| –2 |  
 = 3 ln 2,

which is a constant.  Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an additive constant, the two candidates represent the same antiderivative.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the antiderivative

(x − 5) √((x+1)/(x−1)) − 3 ln|…| + constant,

and the only difference is in the logarithm’s argument:

Candidate 1: |(√(x−1) − √(x+1))/(√(x−1) + √(x+1))|

Candidate 2: |(√((x+1)/(x−1)) − 1)/(√((x+1)/(x−1)) + 1)|

Let t = √((x+1)/(x−1)).  Then

(√(x−1) − √(x+1))/(√(x−1) + √(x+1))
= (1 − t)/(1 + t)
= −(t − 1)/(t + 1).

Because both candidates take the absolute value inside the logarithm, the extra minus sign is irrelevant:

|−(t−1)/(t+1)| = |(t−1)/(t+1)|.

Hence the logarithmic terms differ only by the sign inside an absolute value, making them identical.  With the same algebraic term and an arbitrary constant of integration present in both answers, the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ (at most) by a constant.

1. Algebraically convert the first term:
   (x-5)·√((x+1)/(x-1))  
   = (x-5)(x+1)/√(x²-1)  
   = (x-5)√(x²-1)/(x-1)  (same as Candidate 2’s first term).

2. For the logarithmic term, set  
   a = √(x+1), b = √(x-1).  
   Candidate 1:  –3 ln|(b-a)/(b+a)|  
   = –3[ln|b-a| – ln|b+a|].

   Candidate 2:  3 ln|x + √(x²-1)|  
   = 3 ln[(a+b)²/2]  
   = 6 ln|a+b| – 3 ln 2.

   The difference between these two expressions simplifies to zero (because ln|a+b| + ln|a-b| = ln 2), so the logarithmic parts are the same up to an additive constant, which is absorbed in the “+ C”.

Since both antiderivatives coincide except for an arbitrary constant, the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidate solution sets can be written as the same residue class modulo π.

Candidate 1: x = 5π/16 + π k, k ∈ ℤ  
Candidate 2: x = π m − 11π/16, m ∈ ℤ

Notice that  
−11π/16 ≡ π − 11π/16 = 5π/16 (mod π).

Indeed,
π m − 11π/16 = π(m−1) + (π − 11π/16) = π(m−1) + 5π/16,

so setting k = m − 1 turns Candidate 2’s form into Candidate 1’s. Conversely, any k in Candidate 1 gives m = k + 1 for Candidate 2. Hence the two sets of x-values are identical.

Both answers give the same general formula for all solutions:

• Candidate 1: x = 5π/16 + π k  
• Candidate 2: x = 5π/16 + π m,  m ∈ ℤ

The symbols k and m both denote arbitrary integers (standard mathematical convention). The two formulas therefore describe the identical set of points on the real line.

Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

The two antiderivatives are not the same.  
After simplifying Candidate 1,

1) combine the x–terms:
   (1/32)x + (1/128)x = (5/128)x

2) evaluate the coefficients:
   −(1/32)(1/12) = −1/384  (for sin 12x)
   −(1/8)(1/6)(1/3) = −1/144  (for sin³ 6x)
   −(1/128)(1/24) = −1/3072 (for sin 24x)

So Candidate 1 equals
   5x/128 − sin(12x)/384 − sin³(6x)/144 − sin(24x)/3072 + C.

Candidate 2 is
   5x/128 − sin(12x)/384 + sin³(6x)/72 − sin(24x)/3072 + C.

The difference between the two expressions is
   sin³(6x)/72 + sin³(6x)/144 = (1/48) sin³(6x),

which is not a constant; therefore they cannot represent the same antiderivative (up to an additive constant).

Both candidates give a single condition on the same quantity p.

• Candidate 1: |p| < 1/2  
• Candidate 2: p < 1/2

Because p = lim |a_{n+1}/a_n| is a limit of non-negative numbers, p ≥ 0. For non-negative p we have |p| = p, so the inequality |p| < 1/2 is exactly the same as p < 1/2.

Thus the sets of p-values allowed by the two answers are identical. The two candidates are therefore equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

1.  The algebraic identity  
   1 / (e^{3x}+√(1+e^{6x})) = √(1+e^{6x}) − e^{3x}

2.  The logarithmic identity  
   ln[(e^{3x}+√(1+e^{6x})−1)/(1+e^{3x}+√(1+e^{6x}))] = ½ ln[(√(1+e^{6x})−1)/(√(1+e^{6x})+1)]

Using these, the two expressions inside each candidate match term-by-term after accounting for their coefficients. Hence the two antiderivatives differ at most by a constant, meaning they represent the same indefinite integral.

Candidate 1 lists the first four non-zero terms and appends “+ …”, indicating that it represents the beginning of an infinite Taylor series.

Candidate 2 lists the same four terms but omits the ellipsis, so it presents only a finite quartic polynomial, not an explicitly continued series.

Because the question explicitly asks for “the sum of the first four non-zero terms, followed by dots,” the ellipsis is a required component. Candidate 2 therefore omits a crucial element that Candidate 1 includes.

Hence, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 explicitly assigns the amounts to each specific account:

• 1st account (4 %): $75 000  
• 2nd account (3 %): $15 000  
• 3rd account (2 %): $10 000  

Candidate 2 merely lists three numbers in the order “answer 1, answer 2, answer 3” = $15 000, $75 000, $10 000, without labeling which account each amount belongs to. Under the natural interpretation (answers listed in the same order as the accounts are mentioned: first, second, third), Candidate 2 would be saying:

• 1st account: $15 000  
• 2nd account: $75 000  
• 3rd account: $10 000  

This distribution differs from Candidate 1. Because the question distinguishes the three specific accounts, the order (and therefore the mapping of amounts to accounts) matters; the two candidates give different assignments. Hence, the answers are not equivalent.

Compare to 6 significant digits:

They differ at the 4th significant digit (…4920 vs …4900).  
According to Rule 4, they are not equivalent.
The two candidates express the rate in different units (percent vs. decimal).  
Converting Candidate 1 to decimal: 4.492 % = 0.04492.  
Comparing 0.04492 (to six significant digits: 0.0449200) with Candidate 2’s 0.0449 (to six significant digits: 0.0449000) shows a difference at the 4th significant digit.  
Per Rule 4, they must match to six significant digits; they do not. Hence, the answers are not equivalent.

2. The arctangent part:  
   Candidate 1 coefficient 30√3/729 simplifies to 10√3/243, matching Candidate 2.  
   The argument √(4/27)(x+½)= (2x+1)/√27 = (2x+1)/(3√3), also matching Candidate 2.

Both candidates simplify to exactly the same antiderivative up to an additive constant:

1.  Their rational (non-log) parts are identical:
   (2/3)(2−3 sin²(3x))/[(sin²(3x)−1) sin(3x)] .

2.  The difference of their logarithmic parts reduces to
      ln[(1+sin 3x)(1−sin 3x)] − 2 ln|cos 3x|
      = ln(cos² 3x) − 2 ln|cos 3x| = 0,
   i.e. only a constant.

Hence the two expressions differ at most by a constant, so they are equivalent antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives differ by the term  

− 4 / (3 sin 3x),

which is not a constant (it depends on x).

Both candidates express the Fourier series as an infinite sum over odd harmonics with coefficient 1 /(odd integer):

Candidate 1: ∑_{n=1}^{∞} sin((2n−1)x)/(2n−1)  
Candidate 2: ∑_{k=1}^{∞} sin((2k−1)x)/(2k−1)

The symbols n and k are dummy summation indices; (2n−1) and (2k−1) represent the same odd integers. Therefore the two series are identical, so the answers are equivalent.

Both series can be matched by the change of index n = k – 1.

Candidate 2: ∑_{n=0}^∞ (-1)^{n+1} (2n+1) x^{2n} / (2n+3)!

Set n = k – 1 (so k = 1,2,3,…):

 (-1)^{k} (2k−1) x^{2k−2} / (2k+1)!,

which is exactly Candidate 1’s term.

Thus the two series represent the same expression; the difference is only the starting index notation.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions can be matched simply by a change of index.

Starting from Candidate 1
∑_{k=1}^{∞} (-1)^k (2k-1) x^{2k-2} /(2k+1)! ,

set m = k − 1 ⇒ k = m + 1.  
Then k = 1 → m = 0, and

(-1)^k = (-1)^{m+1},  
2k − 1 = 2(m+1) − 1 = 2m + 1,  
x^{2k-2} = x^{2(m+1)-2} = x^{2m},  
(2k + 1)! = (2(m+1) + 1)! = (2m + 3)!.

Hence the series becomes
∑_{m=0}^{∞} (-1)^{m+1} (2m + 1) x^{2m} /(2m + 3)! ,

which is exactly Candidate 2.

Therefore, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent. Candidate 2 gives the inverse as

The two antiderivatives can be rewritten into the same form up to an additive constant:

1.  (3/4) ln[(1+cos u)/(1−cos u)]  
    = (3/4) · (−2 ln|tan(u/2)|)  
    = −(3/2) ln|tan(u/2)|,

2.  The remaining algebraic terms differ by  
    (−cos³/(2 sin²) − 3/2 cos) − (−cos/(2 sin²) − cos)  
    = [−cos³ + cos]/(2 sin²) − 1/2 cos  
    = cos sin²/(2 sin²) − 1/2 cos  
    = 1/2 cos − 1/2 cos  
    = 0.

Hence Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 differ only by a constant of integration, so they represent the same antiderivative.

• Candidate 1 lists 20 “possibilities” (all possible rational zeros) and does not select the actual roots; it contains many numbers that are not solutions.  
• Candidate 2 gives exactly two numbers, –1/2 and –3/4.

Because the two candidates supply different sets of answers (and Candidate 1 includes many extra values), they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same algebraic combination except for the logarithm term:  

Candidate 1: … + 3 ln |x + 4 + √(x² + 8x)|  
Candidate 2: … + 3 ln ( x + 4 + √(x² + 8x) )

The integrand is defined for x ≤ –8 or x ≥ 0 (because x²+8x ≥ 0).  
For x ≤ –8 the quantity x + 4 + √(x² + 8x) is negative, so

ln |…| is real-valued whereas ln(…) without absolute value is not defined in ℝ.  
Thus Candidate 2 is not a real antiderivative on the entire domain of the integrand; the two expressions differ more than by an additive constant.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 says the function has

Candidate 2 indicates  
• no relative minima,  
• no relative maxima,  
• saddle points at (0, 0), (2, 2), and (2, –2).

Because Candidate 2 lists an additional saddle point (0, 0) that Candidate 1 does not, the two answers disagree on the saddle-point set. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions represent antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

1. Candidate 1  
   (1/42) cot⁴(10x) + (1/63) cot⁶(10x)  
   = 1/63 sin⁻⁶(10x) – 1/42 sin⁻⁴(10x) + (1/126)

   The extra 1/126 can be absorbed into the arbitrary constant of integration.

2. Candidate 2  
   1/63 sin⁻⁶(10x) – 1/42 sin⁻⁴(10x)

Hence, after absorbing the constant, the two antiderivatives are the same.
Reasoning:

Rewrite candidate 1:

(1/21)\[(1/2) cot⁴(10x) + (1/3) cot⁶(10x)\]
= (1/42) cot⁴(10x) + (1/63) cot⁶(10x)
= (1/42) cos⁴(10x)/sin⁴(10x) + (1/63) cos⁶(10x)/sin⁶(10x).

Candidate 2 is

1/(63 sin⁶(10x)) – 1/(42 sin⁴(10x)).

These two expressions differ by factors of cos⁴(10x) and cos⁶(10x); they are not the same function up to an additive constant. Plugging, for instance, 10x = π/2 (so sin = 1, cos = 0) gives candidate 1 = C, while candidate 2 = C – 1/126, showing the difference is not a constant zero. Therefore the two antiderivatives are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give an antiderivative that differs only by an additive constant:

Candidate 1:  
(1/42) cot⁴(10x) + (1/63) cot⁶(10x)  
  = 1/(63 sin⁶(10x)) − 1/(42 sin⁴(10x)) + 1/126.

Candidate 2:  
1/(63 sin⁶(10x)) − 1/(42 sin⁴(10x)).

Since the two expressions differ by the constant 1/126, they represent the same family of antiderivatives (indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant). Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

The two antiderivatives would be equivalent only if their difference were a constant (independent of x).  
After rewriting both in terms of s = sin x and c = cos x,

Candidate 1 (up to a constant):
 1/s   –  s/(2(1 – s²))  +  (3/4) ln|1 – s|  –  (3/4) ln|1 + s|

Candidate 2 (up to a constant):
 –1/[s(1 – s²)]  –  (3/2) s/(1 – s²)  +  (3/4) ln|1 – s|  –  (3/4) ln|1 + s|

The logarithmic parts are identical (up to an overall constant), but the rational parts differ:

Difference = (1/s – s/(2(1 – s²))) – (–1/[s(1 – s²)] – (3/2)s/(1 – s²))
    = 2 / [s(1 – s²)],

which clearly depends on x, hence is not a constant.

Therefore the two candidates are NOT equivalent antiderivatives.

  Putting over the common denominator (x − 1)(x − 2)(x − 3)(x − 4) gives the numerator  
  (x − 3)²(x − 1) − (x − 2)²(x − 4) = x² − 5x + 7.

  Thus Candidate 1 simplifies to (x² − 5x + 7)/[(x − 1)(x − 2)(x − 3)(x − 4)].

• Candidate 2 already states exactly this same fraction.

Hence the two expressions are identical (aside from the same inevitable poles at x = 1,2,3,4).

The question asks for the local minimum value(s) and the local maximum value(s) of the given function.

Candidate 1 gives three points:
• P(0, –4) declared as a local minimum  
• P(8, –516) declared as a local minimum  
• P(2, 24) declared as a local maximum  

Thus the local‐extremum values contained in Candidate 1 are –4, –516 (minima) and 24 (maximum).

Candidate 2 simply lists the three numbers
24, –4, –516.

These three numbers are exactly the same values as those implicit in Candidate 1.  
The problem statement does not explicitly require the responder to label which value is a minimum or a maximum; it only asks for the values themselves. Therefore Candidate 2, though not labeling, still supplies the identical set of values requested.

Hence both candidates supply the same answer set, so they are equivalent.

Candidate 2 is exactly:

The candidates give two answers each (density and moment).  

• Moment Mₓᵧ: both give 5 π / 72 – this matches.  
• Density ρ(x,y,z):  
  – Candidate 1: 1 + (x² + y²)^{3/2}  
  – Candidate 2: (x² + y²)² + √(x² + y²)  

These two density expressions are not the same. Since one of the required sub-answers differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates present the antiderivative as

  √(9x + 4)/(3x)  –  (3/4) ln( … )  + C ,

and the only apparent difference is in the placement of the absolute-value bars inside the logarithm:

• Candidate 1: ln( |√(9x+4) – 2| / (√(9x+4)+2) )

• Candidate 2: ln | (√(9x+4) – 2)/(√(9x+4)+2) |

Because the denominator √(9x+4)+2 is always positive for all real x (square root is non-negative and 2 > 0), we have

| (√(9x+4) – 2)/(√(9x+4)+2) |  =  |√(9x+4) – 2| / (√(9x+4)+2) .

Hence the two logarithmic terms are identical, and the overall expressions differ, at most, by an additive constant C (which is already present). Therefore the two antiderivatives are mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates present different functional expressions:

Candidate 2: 2 ln|x − 1 + √(x² − 4x + 2)| + 5 √(x² − 4x + 2) + C

These expressions are clearly not the same up to an additive constant: one contains an arcsin term and the other contains a √(...) term with different coefficients and even the logarithm part has a different linear term inside (x−2 vs x−1). No algebraic/trigonometric identity converts the −3 arcsin[…] term into +5 √(...) or reconciles the differing logarithms in a way that would leave only a constant difference. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivative expressions differ by more than an additive constant.  
Evaluating them at two distinct values of x (e.g., x = 0 and x = 5) gives different differences between the two candidates, so they cannot represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give completely different antiderivatives:  

Candidate 1 = 2 ln|x−2+√(x²−4x+2)| − 3 arcsin(x /[(x−1)√2]) + C  
Candidate 2 = 2 ln|x−2+√(x²−4x+2)| + 3 ln|x−1+√(x²−4x+2)| + C  

Besides the common first logarithm, one result contains an arcsin term while the other contains an additional logarithm.  
Because the derivative of an arcsin term is of the form u′/√(1−u²) whereas the derivative of a logarithm term is u′/u, the two expressions cannot differ only by an additive constant. Therefore they are not equivalent antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not equivalent.

•  Different functional forms:  
  – Candidate 1 expands into  
    1/5·cos(x/3)/sin⁵(x/3) + 4/15·cos(x/3)/sin³(x/3) + 8/15·cot(x/3) + C.  
  – Candidate 2 is  
    −1/3·cot(x/3) − 2/9·cot³(x/3) − 1/15·cot⁵(x/3) + C.

  These contain different combinations of powers of cos / sin; e.g., Candidate 1 has a cos/sin⁵ term, while Candidate 2 has a cos⁵/sin⁵ term that cannot be converted into the former by any constant shift.

•  Checking derivatives:  
  – d/dx [Candidate 2] = 1 / (9 sin⁶(x/3)),  
  – The required integrand is −1 / (3 sin⁶(x/3)).  
    The derivative differs by both sign and a factor of 3, so Candidate 2 is not even an antiderivative of the given integrand, whereas Candidate 1 produces a different expression.  
  Since their derivatives are different, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 cannot differ only by a constant.

Therefore, according to the rules, the answers are not equivalent.
Both antiderivatives can differ by at most an additive constant.  

Candidate 1 simplifies as follows (let cot(θ)=cot(x/3) and csc²(θ)=1+cot²):

1) Rewrite each term in cot and csc:
   cos/sin⁵ = cot·csc⁴, cos/sin³ = cot·csc².

2) Candidate 1:
   F₁ = cot·[ (1/5)csc⁴ + (4/15)csc² + (8/15) ]  
      = cot·[ (1/5)(1+cot²)² + (4/15)(1+cot²) + 8/15 ]  
      = cot·[ 1 + (2/3)cot² + (1/5)cot⁴ ]  
      = cot + (2/3)cot³ + (1/5)cot⁵ + C.

This is exactly Candidate 2. Thus the two expressions differ only by the integration constant and are mathematically identical antiderivatives of the given integrand.

Candidate 2: 6 x² + 3 x y – y² – 2 x + y = 0

Although both contain the same quadratic part (6 x² + 3 x y – y²), the linear terms differ in sign:

• Coefficient of x: +2 in Candidate 1, –2 in Candidate 2  
• Coefficient of y: –1 in Candidate 1, +1 in Candidate 2  

Multiplying either equation by a non-zero constant cannot make only the linear terms’ signs switch while leaving the quadratic terms unchanged, so the two equations are not scalar multiples of each other. Therefore, they represent different curves.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give implicit quadratic equations.

Candidate 1: 6 x² − y² + 3 xy + 2 x − y = 0  
Candidate 2: −18 x² + 3 xy + 8 y² + 8 x + 8 y = 0

For the curves to be the same, the polynomials must differ only by a non-zero scalar multiple (since both are single, irreducible quadratic factors).

Compare coefficients:

• x²: −18 / 6 = −3  
• y²: 8 / (−1) = −8

The ratios are not equal (−3 ≠ −8), so the polynomials are not proportional.

Additionally, a point on Candidate 1 such as (−1/3, 0) satisfies 6(−1/3)² + 2(−1/3)=0, hence lies on Candidate 1, but substituting into Candidate 2 gives −14/3 ≠ 0, so it does not lie on Candidate 2. Therefore the two equations define different curves.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give the same radius of convergence (∞) and the same closed-form expression for the sum when x ≠ 0:
 3(1 + e^x(x − 1))/x².

However, Candidate 1 explicitly supplies the value of the sum at x = 0 (3/2) in a piece-wise definition, while Candidate 2 gives no value at x = 0, leaving the function undefined there.  
Because the series does converge at x = 0 and the question asks for the sum of the series (which includes that point), Candidate 2 omits a required part of the answer. Hence the two candidates’ answers are not fully identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The task asks for two items:

1. Radius of convergence  
2. The explicit sum of the series (i.e. a function that coincides with the series for every value of x inside the radius, including x = 0).

Comparison of the two candidates:

1. Radius of convergence  
   • Candidate 1:  R = ∞  
   • Candidate 2:  ∞  
   – These match.

2. Sum of the series  
   • Candidate 1: f(x)=  
        – for x≠0 :  3(e^x(x−1)+1)/x²  
        – for x = 0 :  3/2  
   • Candidate 2: 3(e^x(x−1)+1)/x²  (no separate value given for x=0)

   The two formulas coincide for every x≠0.  
   At x=0 the series clearly sums to 3/2, which Candidate 1 states explicitly, while Candidate 2 leaves the expression 0/0 and gives no separate value. Hence Candidate 2 is missing the value at the one point x=0, so the two proposed sums are not exactly the same function. Because the problem requires the complete sum of the series and Candidate 2 omits that value, the answers are not fully identical.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question asks for two separate things:
1. The radius of convergence.
2. The full sum of the series (which must include the value at \(x = 0\), because \(x = 0\) lies inside the interval of convergence).

Comparison:

1. Radius of convergence  
   • Candidate 1: \(R = \infty\)  
   • Candidate 2: \(R = \infty\)  
   → Same.

2. Sum of the series  
   • Candidate 1: piecewise  
     – for \(x \neq 0\): \(\dfrac{3(1 - e^x + x e^x)}{x^2}\)  
     – for \(x = 0\): \( \dfrac{3}{2}\)  
   • Candidate 2: \(\dfrac{3(1 - e^x + x e^x)}{x^2}\) (no value given at \(x = 0\))

   The two give identical formulas for \(x \neq 0\), but only Candidate 1 supplies the required value at \(x = 0\). Candidate 2 leaves the expression undefined at that point. Because the question asks for the sum on the whole domain of convergence—including \(x = 0\)—Candidate 2 is missing part of the answer.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates differ by an absolute‐value sign:

• Candidate 1:  κ = 1 / [48·|sin(t/2)|]  
• Candidate 2:  κ = 1 / [48·sin(t/2)]

Because sin(t/2) can be negative for some values of t, the presence or absence of the absolute value changes the sign (and therefore the value) of the expression whenever sin(t/2) < 0. Since curvature should be non-negative, Candidate 2 yields negative values in those regions, whereas Candidate 1 remains positive. Hence the two expressions are not mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1  
θ–interval: [3π/2 , 5π/2]  r–interval: 0 ≤ r ≤ 4 cos θ  

Because adding 2π to an angle leaves the direction unchanged, this θ–interval is equivalent to the interval [−π/2 , π/2]. Hence Candidate 1 covers every direction for which cos θ ≥ 0, i.e. all rays pointing into the right half–plane. Together with 0 ≤ r ≤ 4 cos θ, this describes the entire disk (x−2)²+y² ≤ 2².

Candidate 2  
θ–interval: 0 ≤ θ ≤ π/2  r–interval: 0 ≤ r ≤ 4 cos θ  

This includes only directions in the first quadrant (x≥0, y≥0). Points with y<0 that lie in the disk—for example (2, −1)—cannot be represented because their polar angle is −arctan(1/2) (or 2π−arctan(1/2)), which is not contained in [0, π/2]. Therefore Candidate 2 describes only a quarter of the disk, not the whole region.

Since the two descriptions do not generate the same set of points, the candidates are not equivalent.

 = −(3/8)tan^{-8/3}x − (3/2)tan^{-2/3}x + C.

Candidate 2:
−3/(8 tan^{8/3}x) − 3/(2 tan^{2/3}x) + C

  (3/8) tan^( 8/3) x  −  (3/8) tan^(−8/3) x  + C.

They differ by terms involving tan^(8/3) x and tan^(−2/3) x; their difference is not a constant, so they cannot represent the same antiderivative up to an additive constant.

The question asks for two specific components.  
Both candidates give two answers:

2. Normal component:  
   • Candidate 1:  ω² |a| (always non-negative)  
   • Candidate 2:  a ω² (depends on the sign of a)

Because Candidate 1 explicitly uses the absolute value while Candidate 2 does not, the second answers differ whenever a could be negative. Hence the two sets of answers are not mathematically identical.

−sin(1.5) = sin(−1.5) = sin(−3/2).

1. The same 3rd-order Taylor polynomial  
   P₃(x) = π/4 + ½(x-1) − ¼(x-1)² + 1/12(x-1)³.

2. The same Lagrange remainder.  
   Candidate 1 writes  
   R₃(x) = [−48c³/(1+c²)⁴ + 24c/(1+c²)³]/4! · (x−1)⁴,  
   which simplifies to c(1−c²)/(1+c²)⁴ · (x−1)⁴ (because the bracketed term equals 24c(1−c²)/(1+c²)⁴ and dividing by 4! = 24 cancels the 24).  
   Candidate 2 already states R₃(x) = c(1−c²)/(1+c²)⁴ · (x−1)⁴.

The two candidates both give the same radius of convergence \(R=\infty\).

For the sum of the series:

•  Candidate 1 gives  
  \(S(x)= \dfrac{e^{x}\!\left(2-2x+x^{2}\right)-2}{x^{3}}\) for \(x\neq0\) and explicitly adds the value \(S(0)=\tfrac13\).

•  Candidate 2 gives  
  \(S(x)= \dfrac{e^{x}\!\left(x^{2}-2x+2\right)-2}{x^{3}}\) (algebraically the same expression as Candidate 1 for \(x\neq0\)) but does not specify any value at \(x=0\).  As written, Candidate 2’s formula is undefined at \(x=0\) and therefore omits the series sum there, whereas Candidate 1 supplies it.

Because Candidate 2 is missing the value at \(x=0\), the answers are not completely identical; a required component (the sum at \(x=0\)) is omitted. Hence the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give the same radius of convergence (∞).  
For the sum when x ≠ 0, simplifying Candidate 1’s formula yields exactly

 e^x(2/x³ – 2/x² + 1/x) – 2/x³,

which is identical to Candidate 2’s expression after dividing out the x³ in its denominator. Hence the two sums agree for every x ≠ 0.

However, Candidate 1 also specifies the value at x = 0 (f(0)=1/3), while Candidate 2 leaves x = 0 undefined (its single formula has a 0 in the denominator). Because the question asks for the full sum of the series—whose value at x = 0 is part of that sum—Candidate 2 is missing a required piece of information that Candidate 1 supplies.

Therefore the two answers are not fully equivalent.
The two candidates give:

Radius of convergence  
• Candidate 1: R = ∞  
• Candidate 2: R = ∞  
 → identical.

Sum of the series (for x ≠ 0)  
• Candidate 1:   ( e^x (2 – 2x + x²) – 2 ) / x³  
• Candidate 2:   ( e^x (x² – 2x + 2) – 2 ) / x³  

The numerators are the same polynomial written in a different order, so the formulas coincide.  
Candidate 1 also specifies the value at x = 0 (1/3); Candidate 2 omits it, but the limit of Candidate 2’s expression as x→0 is 1/3, so both represent the same analytic function. Hence the answers are mathematically equivalent.

= −[ (1/5)(cot + 2 cot³ + cot⁵) + (4/15)(cot + cot³) + (8/15) cot ]

= −cot − (2/3) cot³ − (1/5) cot⁵ + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2 (up to the arbitrary constant).  
Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

Reasoning:

Both candidates present an infinite-series expansion.  
Candidate 2 is the standard Maclaurin series for asinh x:

  y = Σ_{n=0}^{∞} (-1)^{n} (2n)! / [4^{n} (n!)^{2} (2n+1)]  x^{2n+1}.

Candidate 1 lists the first few terms with the correct alternating signs,

  x − x³/6 + 3x⁵/40 − 5x⁷/112 + …,

but then gives the “general term”

  +(2n−1)!! /(2n)!! · x^{2n+1}/(2n+1) + …

which omits the factor (-1)^{n}.  
Without that factor the signs of the coefficients for n = 1, 3, … would be positive instead of negative, contradicting both Candidate 2 and Candidate 1’s own earlier terms.

Because the general form in Candidate 1 does not match Candidate 2’s expression, the two answers are not equivalent.

• For inflection points, Candidate 1 lists only (–½, –1/16), whereas Candidate 2 lists two points (x = –½ and x = 0).  
• Their interval answers for monotonicity also differ at the single point x = 0.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates give the exact same numerical value for the area, namely 972/5.  
No units are specified in either answer (which is acceptable since the question itself does not specify units).  
There is only one quantity required, and both provide that single quantity.  
Thus, according to the rules, the two answers are equivalent.

The two expressions are written in different Fourier‐integral forms (Candidate 1 in sine/cosine form over α>0; Candidate 2 in complex-exponential form over k∈ℝ).  
After converting Candidate 1 to the complex form, its spectral factor is

F(α) = 2 i e^{-i2α}/α  +  (e^{-i2α} – 1)/α².

Candidate 2’s spectral factor (inside the 1/(2π) integral) is

π(2i e^{-i2k}/(ik) – (1 – e^{-i2k})/k²) = 2 e^{-i2k}/k – (1 – e^{-i2k})/k²,

which lacks the necessary factor “i’’ in the first term.  
Because the spectra differ, the two integrals cannot yield the same function q(x).

Hence Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives 
x = ln(0.15)/(−0.28).

Numerically, ln(0.15) ≈ −1.89712, so  

x ≈ (−1.89712)/(−0.28) ≈ 6.77543 months (to 6 significant digits).

Candidate 2 gives 6.78 months.  
Expressing both to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 6.77543  
• Candidate 2: 6.78000

Because 6.77543 ≠ 6.78000 at the 6-significant-digit level required by Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the derivative as the sum of two parts:

1. Derivative of sin(2x) cos(3x):
   • Candidate 1: 2 cos(5x) – sin(2x) sin(3x)  
     Using 2 cos(5x)=2[cos(2x)cos(3x)–sin(2x)sin(3x)], this expands to  
     2 cos(2x)cos(3x) – 3 sin(2x)sin(3x).

   • Candidate 2: 2 cos(2x)cos(3x) – 3 sin(2x)sin(3x).

   Hence the first parts are identical.

2. Derivative of –ln(x–1)/ln(x+1):
   • Candidate 1: –[(x+1)ln(x+1) – (x–1)ln(x–1)] / [(x–1)(x+1)(ln(x+1))²]  
     = [ln(x–1)/(x+1) – ln(x+1)/(x–1)] / (ln(x+1))².

   • Candidate 2: –[ln(x+1)/(x–1) – ln(x–1)/(x+1)] / (ln(x+1))²  
     = [ln(x–1)/(x+1) – ln(x+1)/(x–1)] / (ln(x+1))².

   These are the same expression.

Since both parts match, the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

The two candidates give fundamentally different antiderivative expressions.  
Differentiating Candidate 2 yields 1/[(x + 1)(x + 4)], which is not equal to the original integrand 1/[(x + 4)√(x² + 2x + 5)]. Therefore the two results cannot differ only by an additive constant.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

The two antiderivatives are not the same.  
A quick check of candidate 2’s derivative at, say, x = 0 gives

F₂′(0) = 0.100 …

whereas the integrand itself at x = 0 equals

1/[(0 + 4)√5] ≈ 0.111803 … .

Since the derivative of candidate 2 does not reproduce the integrand, it cannot differ from a correct antiderivative (such as candidate 1, if correct) by only a constant. Therefore the two candidates are inequivalent.

The two antiderivatives differ by

A = −3 tan(θ) sin²(θ) − (−3 tan(θ))
   = −3 tan(θ)(sin² θ − 1)
   = −3 tan(θ)(−cos² θ)
   = 3 sin θ cos θ

B = (−9/4 sin 2θ) − (−3/4 sin 2θ)
   = −3/2 sin 2θ
   = −3 sin θ cos θ  (since sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ)

A + B = 3 sin θ cos θ − 3 sin θ cos θ = 0,

where θ = x/3.  
Thus Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 differ only by a constant of integration and are therefore equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both antiderivatives can differ at most by an additive constant.  
Let  

s = sin(x/3), c = cos(x/3).

Candidate 1: A₁(x) = −3 s³/c + (3/2)x − (9/4) sin(2x/3) + C₁  
Candidate 2: A₂(x) = −3 s/c   + (3/2)x − (3/4) sin(2x/3) + C₂

Compute the difference (ignore the arbitrary constants C₁, C₂):

Δ(x) = A₁(x) − A₂(x)  
      = [−3 s³/c + 3 s/c] + [−9/4 sin(2x/3) + 3/4 sin(2x/3)]  
      = −3 (s³ − s)/c − (6/4) sin(2x/3).

But sin(2x/3) = 2 s c, so

−(6/4) sin(2x/3) = −(6/4)(2 s c) = −3 s c.

Thus

Δ(x) = −3 (s³ − s)/c − 3 s c  
      = −3 s³/c + 3 s/c − 3 s c  
      = [−3 s³ + 3 s − 3 s c²]/c  
      = 3 s[−s² + 1 − c²]/c  
      = 3 s[1 − (s² + c²)]/c  
      = 3 s(1 − 1)/c = 0.

Since the difference is identically zero (up to an arbitrary constant), the two candidates are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
First rewrite Candidate 1 to see if it can be brought to the form of Candidate 2.

Let a = x/3.  
Candidate 1:

F₁(x)= −3 sin³a / cos a + (3/2)x − (9/4) sin(2a) + C.

Use identities:

1. sin³a = sin a (1−cos²a)  
 ⇒ −3 sin³a / cos a = −3 sin a/cos a + 3 sin a cos a = −3 tan a + 3 sin a cos a.

2. sin(2a)=2 sin a cos a  
 ⇒ −(9/4) sin(2a)= −(9/4)(2 sin a cos a)= −(9/2) sin a cos a.

Combine the sin a cos a terms in F₁:

3 sin a cos a − (9/2) sin a cos a = (6/2−9/2) sin a cos a = −(3/2) sin a cos a.

So

F₁(x)= −3 tan a + (3/2)x − (3/2) sin a cos a + C.

Now examine Candidate 2:

F₂(x)= −3 tan a + (3/2)x − (3/4) sin(2a) + C  
   = −3 tan a + (3/2)x − (3/4)(2 sin a cos a) + C  
   = −3 tan a + (3/2)x − (3/2) sin a cos a + C.

Thus F₁(x) and F₂(x) are identical up to an arbitrary constant. Therefore the two antiderivatives are equivalent.

The derivative of Candidate 2’s antiderivative  

F(x) = –(3/8)(8 – x²)^{4/3}

is  

F′(x) = x(8 – x²)^{1/3},

whereas the integrand is (x(8 – x²))^{1/3} = x^{1/3}(8 – x²)^{1/3}.  
Because x ≠ x^{1/3} (except at x = 0 or 1), Candidate 2 does not integrate to the required function.

Candidate 1 gives a completely different, much more complicated expression. Since Candidate 2 is not even an antiderivative of the integrand, the two candidates cannot be equivalent.

Both expressions can be rewritten in terms of cot (11 x).

Candidate 2  
(1/2) csc⁴(11x) – 2 csc²(11x) + 2 ln|csc(11x)|  
= (1/2)(1+2 cot²+cot⁴) – 2(1+cot²) + ln(1+cot²)  
= (1/2) cot⁴ – cot² + ln(1+cot²) – 3/2.

Candidate 1  
(1/2) cot⁴ – cot² + ln(1+cot²) + C.

Thus  
Candidate 2 = Candidate 1 – 3/2,  
i.e. the two antiderivatives differ only by an additive constant, which is immaterial for indefinite integrals.  

Therefore the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Both antiderivatives differentiate to the same integrand  
22 cot(−11x)⁵ = −22 cot⁵(11x).  
Explicitly,
• Candidate 1 gives  
 F₁(x)=½ cot⁴(11x)−cot²(11x)+ln(1+cot²(11x))+C.  
• Candidate 2 gives  
 F₂(x)=½ csc⁴(11x)−2 csc²(11x)−2 ln|sin(11x)|+C.

Using csc²(11x)=1+cot²(11x) and ln|sin|=−½ ln(1+cot²), one finds  
F₂(x)=½ cot⁴(11x)−cot²(11x)+ln(1+cot²(11x))−3/2 +C  
   = F₁(x)−3/2.

Thus the two candidates differ only by the constant −3/2, so they are equivalent antiderivatives.

3x ln(√(2 − x) + √(2 + x)) − (3/2)x + 3 arcsin(x/2) + (constant).

Candidate 1’s “−(3/2)(C + x)” merely introduces an arbitrary constant −(3/2)C, which can be absorbed into the overall integration constant. Therefore the two expressions differ only by an additive constant, making them mathematically equivalent as indefinite integrals.

The two expressions differ only by an additive constant.

Using  
s₁ = √(x−2), s₂ = √(x+2)  (valid on the real-valued domain of the integrand, e.g. x>2)

Candidate 1’s log term:  

 ln | (s₁ − s₂)/(s₁ + s₂) |  

Observe that  

 (s₁ − s₂)/(s₁ + s₂) = (s₂ − s₁)/(s₁ + s₂) (up to a sign, absorbed by the absolute value)

Compute

 |(s₂ − s₁)/(s₁ + s₂)|  
 = (s₂ − s₁)/(s₁ + s₂)  
 = ((s₂ − s₁)²)/( (s₁ + s₂)(s₂ − s₁) )  
 = ((s₂² − 2s₁s₂ + s₁²))/(s₂² − s₁²)  
 = ( (x+2) + (x−2) − 2s₁s₂ ) / 4  
 = ( 2x − 2s₁s₂ ) / 4  
 = (x − s₁s₂)/2 .

Hence  

 ln |(s₁ − s₂)/(s₁ + s₂)| = ln |x − s₁s₂| − ln 2 .

Therefore

−6 ln |(s₁ − s₂)/(s₁ + s₂)| = −6 ln |x − s₁s₂| + 6 ln 2 ,

which shows Candidate 1 equals Candidate 2 plus the constant 6 ln 2.  
Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant, the two antiderivatives are mathematically equivalent.

  – (±1/√2, ∓1/√2) with opposite signs are local minima.

• Candidate 2 says all points (±1/√2, ±1/√2) are local maxima and gives no minima.

Candidate 2 writes the exact Taylor expansion

 e^x = e^{-1}[1+(x+1)+(x+1)^2/2!+(x+1)^3/3!] + e^{ξ}(x+1)^4/4!,

where ξ is some value between −1 and x.  
Because Candidate 1 truncates the series and replaces the rest with an unspecified remainder involving ξ (different from the constant e^{-1}), the two expressions are not the same representation and are not mathematically equivalent term-by-term to Candidate 2’s infinite series.

The two candidates are not equivalent.  
Candidate 2 gives the complete infinite‐series expansion

The question requires three separate pieces of information (concave-up set, concave-down set, inflection points).  
Both candidates give all three, so we compare each sub-answer.

1. Concave-up region  
   • Candidate 1: (−∞, −1) ∪ (−1, 0) ∪ (0, ∞)  
   • Candidate 2: (−∞, ∞)

   These two sets differ at the single points x = −1 and x = 0: Candidate 1 excludes them, Candidate 2 includes them. Hence the concave-up answers are not identical.

2. Concave-down region  
   Both say “none.” (identical)

3. Inflection points  
   Both say “none.” (identical)

Because at least one sub-answer (the concave-up set) is different, the overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates describe the three required items (concave-up set, concave-down set, inflection points), but they give different sets for where the curve is concave up:

• Candidate 2: concave up on (−∞, ∞)  = ℝ

Thus Candidate 2 includes the points x = −1 and x = 0, whereas Candidate 1 excludes them. Since the sets differ, the answers are not identical. Consequently, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 
• h = 1.80246791 m  
• r = (1+5.40740373)/3 = 2.13580124 m  

Candidate 2 (interpreting the two answers as the two dimensions):  
• h = 1.8 m → taken as 1.80000 m for six-digit comparison  
• r = 2.136 m → taken as 2.13600 m for six-digit comparison  

Compare each component to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

Height:  
1.80247 (candidate 1 rounded to 6 s.d.) vs 1.80000 (candidate 2) differ at the 3rd significant digit → not equal.

Radius:  
2.13580 (candidate 1 rounded to 6 s.d.) vs 2.13600 (candidate 2) differ at the 5th significant digit → not equal.

Since at least one of the required values differs at the 6-significant-digit level, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives
• height h = 1.80246791 m  
• radius r = (1 + 5.40740373)/3 ≈ 2.13580124 m

Candidate 2 gives
• height = 1.80 m  
• radius = 2.14 m  (i.e. 2.140000… m)

Comparing the numerical values to 6 significant digits:

Height: 1.802467 vs 1.800000 → differ in the 3rd decimal place.  
Radius: 2.13580 vs 2.14000 → differ in the 3rd decimal place.

Since the values do not match to 6 significant digits, the two sets of dimensions are not equivalent according to Rule 4.
The problem asks for two distinct quantities: the radius r and the height h.  
Candidate 1 explicitly assigns  
• r ≈ 2.135801 m  
• h ≈ 1.802468 m.

Candidate 2 lists two numbers without labeling which is radius and which is height:  
• 1.80 m, 2.14 m (in that order).  
Interpreting them in the given order (first value for radius, second for height) makes their radius ≈ 1.80 m and height ≈ 2.14 m, which do not match Candidate 1's assignments.  
Even if one tried to swap the interpretation, Candidate 2 still fails to label, creating ambiguity; the answers therefore cannot be considered identical, and the required correspondence of each specific dimension is not met.

Hence the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of the same integrand.  
Their formulas are

Candidate 1:  (3/√7)·arctan[(1+2 tan x)/√7] + C₁  
Candidate 2:  (3/√7)·arctan[(3 tan(x+π/8)+√2)/√7] + C₂.

Setting t = tan x and using the tangent‐addition formula one finds

3 tan(x+π/8)+√2
= [(1+√2)t + (4√2−3)] /(1−(√2−1)t).

With this, for every t the quantity

(arctan[(1+2t)/√7] − arctan{[(1+√2)t + (4√2−3)] / [√7(1−(√2−1)t)]})

is a constant (its numerical value is about −0.424 rad).  
Hence the two antiderivatives differ only by an overall additive constant:

Candidate 2 − Candidate 1 = (3/√7)·(constant).

Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary constant, the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Write t = tan x.  Then

Candidate 1 is exactly this.

For Candidate 2, set a = √2 − 1 = tan(π/8).  With t = tan x,

w = (3 tan(x+π/8)+√2)/√7
  = (3 t + 3 a + √2 − √2 a t)/(√7(1−a t)).

Let u = (1+2 t)/√7 (the argument in Candidate 1).  A direct computation gives

(w−u)/(1+wu) = √7 · (a/(1+√2)),

which is a number that does not depend on t (hence on x).  Therefore

arctan w − arctan u = constant,

so (3/√7) arctan w differs from (3/√7) arctan u only by an additive constant.  
Thus the two antiderivatives differ only by an overall constant of integration and are mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates give an expression for the same single quantity f(x)·g(x).

• Candidate 1 presents the power-series coefficients directly:
  Σ_{n=2}^{∞} (1/6) n (n² − 1) xⁿ.

• Candidate 2 gives a closed-form generating function:
  x² / (1 − x)⁴.

Expanding Candidate 2:
(1 − x)^{−4} = Σ_{k=0}^{∞} (k+3 choose 3) x^k = Σ_{k=0}^{∞} [(k+3)(k+2)(k+1)/6] x^k.

Multiplying by x² and re-indexing with n = k+2 yields
Σ_{n=2}^{∞} [(n+1)n(n−1)/6] xⁿ = Σ_{n=2}^{∞} (1/6) n (n² − 1) xⁿ,

exactly the same series as Candidate 1.  
Thus the two answers are mathematically identical.

The two equations represent the same line:

Candidate 1:
y = (1/5)(x + 3/√2) + 3/√2  
  = (1/5)x + (3/(5√2)) + 3/√2  
  = (1/5)x + 3/(5√2) + 15/(5√2)  
  = (1/5)x + 18/(5√2)  
  = (1/5)x + (18√2)/(10)  
  = (1/5)x + 9√2/5

Candidate 2:
y = (1/5)x + 9√2/5

Since the simplified form of Candidate 1 matches Candidate 2 exactly, the two candidates are equivalent.

Both expressions can be rewritten in a common simplified form.

Let A = arctan(2x).

Candidate 1:
(1/16)[2A² + 2 ln(4x²+1) + 8x²A² – 8xA] + C
= (1/2)x²A² + (1/8)A² + (1/8)ln(4x²+1) – (1/2)xA + C.

Candidate 2:
((4x²+1)/8)A² – (1/2)xA + (1/8)ln(1+4x²) + C
= (1/2)x²A² + (1/8)A² + (1/8)ln(4x²+1) – (1/2)xA + C.

These simplified forms are identical up to an additive constant of integration. Hence the two candidates give the same antiderivative.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates simplify to the same antiderivative:

Candidate 1 simplifies to
½ x²(atan(2x))² + ⅛(atan(2x))² − ½ x atan(2x) + ⅛ ln(1+4x²) + C,

which is exactly the expression given by Candidate 2 (differing at most by the integration constant).

Both candidate expressions are antiderivatives that differ only in how the trigonometric terms are written.  
Candidate 1 contains the extra term −(1/32)(sin 4x)³, but using the identity  

  sin³ α = (3 sin α − sin 3α)/4

gives  
 −(1/32)(sin 4x)³  =  −(3 sin 4x − sin 12x)/128  
 =  −3/128 sin 4x + 1/128 sin 12x.

Adding this to the other terms in Candidate 1 converts its coefficients to exactly those in Candidate 2:

• sin 4x coefficient: 3/8 = 48/128; 48/128 − 3/128 = 45/128  
• sin 8x coefficient: 9/128 (matches)  
• sin 12x coefficient: 1/128 (matches)  
• x term: 15/16 (matches)

Hence both candidates represent the same antiderivative (up to an additive constant).

Both candidates give the same mathematical expression:

Candidate 1:  −(84 x² + 1372)/(x² − 49)³  
     = −28(3 x² + 49)/(x² − 49)³  (factor 28)

Candidate 2:  −28(3 x² + 49)/(x² − 49)³

Since these are identical, the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the antiderivative

–3 [½(2x)^{1/3}+⅓(2x)^{1/2}+¼(2x)^{2/3}+(2x)^{1/6}+ln| (2x)^{1/6}–1 |]  +  constant,

just written in slightly different forms:
• Candidate 1:  C₁ – 3( … )  
• Candidate 2:  –3( … ) + C₂

The two differ only by the arbitrary integration constant (C₂ – C₁), so they are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

The two proposed antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant.  
Candidate 1 contains extra algebraic terms
 (2x)^{1/6}, (2x)^{1/3}, (2x)^{1/2}, (2x)^{2/3}
that vary with x, whereas Candidate 2 consists only of a logarithm.  
Because those extra algebraic terms cannot be absorbed into a constant, the two expressions cannot differ merely by a constant. Hence the answers are inequivalent.

Both candidates give the same mathematical expression once simplified:

Candidate 1:  
(2 e^{2t}) / (2 + 2 e^{4t} + 4 e^{2t})  
 = 2 e^{2t} / [2(1 + e^{2t})²]  
 = e^{2t} / (1 + e^{2t})².

Candidate 2:  
1 / (e^{t} + e^{-t})²  
 = 1 / [e^{-2t}(1 + e^{2t})²]  
 = e^{2t} / (1 + e^{2t})².

Since both simplify to e^{2t} / (1 + e^{2t})², they are equivalent.

Both antiderivatives can be rewritten with the same powers of (2x − 3):

Candidate 1 simplifies to
C + (2/5)(2x−3)^{5/4} − (4/3)(2x−3)^{3/4} + 18(2x−3)^{1/4} − 54/√3 · arctan[(2x−3)^{1/4}/√3].

Note that −54/√3 = −(54√3)/3 = −18√3.

Hence Candidate 1 becomes
C + (2/5)(2x−3)^{5/4} − (4/3)(2x−3)^{3/4} + 18(2x−3)^{1/4} − 18√3 · arctan[(2x−3)^{1/4}/√3],

which is exactly Candidate 2. Therefore the two answers are mathematically identical (differing only by a constant of integration).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives differ by an overall multiplicative factor of 2 (all four coefficients in Candidate 2 are exactly twice the corresponding coefficients in Candidate 1).  
Multiplying an antiderivative by a non-unit constant changes its derivative by that same factor, so the two expressions cannot differ only by an additive constant. Therefore they are not equivalent.

The two proposed equations describe different sets of points.

• Candidate 1:  x²/64 + y²/(64 – c²) = 1  → an ellipse (y² depends on x).  
• Candidate 2:  y² = 256 – c²  → two horizontal lines (y constant, independent of x).

These loci are clearly not the same. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both antiderivatives differ only by

(1/288) sin³(12x) – (1/384) sin(12x) + (1/1152) sin(36x).

Using the identity sin (36x) = 3 sin(12x) – 4 sin³(12x), this expression becomes

(1/288) sin³(12x) – (1/384) sin(12x) + (1/384) sin(12x) – (1/288) sin³(12x) = 0,

so the two candidates differ only by a constant. Hence they are equivalent.

The question explicitly requests the answer “in eV”.  
Candidate 2 supplies the unit, Candidate 1 gives the same numerical value without the unit.  
Because the question specifies the unit (eV) unambiguously, the omission of “eV” in Candidate 1 does not introduce confusion: the number is naturally read as being in eV.  
Numerically, both give 0.038 (matching to six significant digits).

Therefore, the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same numerical value: 0.038.  
The question explicitly asks for the energy “in eV,” so the only sensible unit is eV. Candidate 2 states the unit explicitly, while Candidate 1 omits it; however, because no alternative unit is reasonable here, this omission does not create ambiguity.  

Since the numeric values match exactly (0.038 vs. 0.038) and the implicit unit for Candidate 1 is eV, the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives “-0.8” (no explicit unit, but the problem statement’s unit is 10⁻⁴ m³, so it most naturally reads as –0.8 × 10⁻⁴ m³).  
Candidate 2 gives “8.0 × 10⁻⁴ m³”.

The two numerical values differ both in sign and by a factor of 10. According to Rule 4 (compare numerical answers to six significant digits), they are not the same. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem asks for TWO pieces of information:
1) the interval in which the smallest positive root lies, and  
2) the numerical value of that root (to two decimal places).

Candidate 1 supplies only a single number “2.37,” omitting the interval altogether.

Candidate 2 supplies both an interval “(π/2, π)” and a numerical root “2.38.”

Because Candidate 1 fails to provide one of the required answers, while Candidate 2 does, the two responses are not equivalent (Rule 2). Even if we compared the numerical roots, 2.37 ≠ 2.38 to 6 significant digits (Rule 4). Therefore the answers are inequivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical value of 3.7 bits.  
Candidate 2 gives the expression log₂(26) − 1 bits, whose numerical value is approximately 3.70044 bits.

Comparing to 6 significant digits required by Rule 4:
• Candidate 1 → 3.70000  
• Candidate 2 → 3.70044  

They differ starting at the 5th significant digit, so the two answers are not identical to 6 significant digits.

69.6 → 69.6000  

Since 70.0000 ≠ 69.6000, they are not identical to six significant digits. Hence, the predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for an angle. Angles can reasonably be expressed either in degrees or in radians. 

• Candidate 1 gives “60.0” but does not specify any unit.  
• Candidate 2 explicitly gives “60 degrees”.

Because Candidate 1 omits the unit while multiple angle units are plausible, this omission creates ambiguity under Rule 1. Therefore the two answers are not guaranteed to represent the same quantity.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value 0.000544 (i.e., exactly 5.44 × 10⁻⁴).  
Candidate 2 gives the fraction 1/1837.

1/1837 ≈ 0.000544366 (to six significant digits: 5 4 4 3 6 6).  
0.000544 expressed to six significant digits is 0.000544000 (5 4 4 0 0 0).

Since the two numbers differ beginning at the fourth significant digit, they are not equal to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give exactly the same single numerical answer: 3660000.  
• The problem asks for only one numerical value, and both supply one value.  
• Units are implied to be “supporters/votes,” identical for both (Rule 1).  
• There is no mismatch in number of required sub-answers (Rule 2).  
• The answers are straightforward numbers, so Rule 4 applies: to six significant digits both are 3.66000 × 10⁶, identical.  
• Neither candidate includes extra solution steps that would invoke Rule 7.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

Candidate 1 gives 1130.0 (unit not specified), while Candidate 2 gives 1107 nm.  
Even assuming Candidate 1’s number is in nanometres, 1130.0 nm ≠ 1107 nm (they differ already in the first three significant digits).  
Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.
The units are effectively the same (both are in nm, though Candidate 1 omits the unit).  
However, numerically 1130.0 nm ≠ 1127 nm when compared to 6 significant digits (1.13000 × 10³ vs 1.12700 × 10³).

Both answers express the same numerical value for the semi-major axis.

• The problem explicitly states that the unit for the answer is “10^11 m.”  
• Candidate 1 gives the pure number 4.15, which in that context means 4.15 × 10^11 m.  
• Candidate 2 writes the full quantity “4.15 × 10^11 m.”

Thus, after accounting for the unit specified in the question, the two responses represent identical quantities.

The question explicitly asks for the Fermi temperature “in eV”.

• Candidate 1 gives “81600.0” with no unit.  
  – If interpreted as eV, that is 8.16 × 10⁴ eV, very different from 7 eV.  
  – If interpreted as Kelvin, the missing unit creates ambiguity, and 81 600 K is the usual Fermi temperature, not the requested eV value.  
  In either case, the answer does not match 7 eV.

• Candidate 2 explicitly states “7 eV”.

Because the two numerical values differ greatly and Candidate 1’s missing/ambiguous unit violates Rule 1, the answers are not equivalent.

The question explicitly asks for the answer “in Mebibytes (MiB).”  

• Candidate 1: “5.93” (no unit given).  
• Candidate 2: “5.93 MiB” (includes required unit).

Because Candidate 1 omits the unit, there is ambiguity about whether the quantity is expressed in MiB or another unit. Under Rule 1, such omission when a specific unit is required makes the answers inequivalent.

Both candidates supply a single numerical answer in the same units (dollars).

Compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 2: 2002.08   → first 6 significant digits = 2 0 0 2 0 8

The sixth significant digit differs (7 vs 8). Therefore the two answers are not identical to 6 significant digits.

Both candidates give a single numerical value for the momentum uncertainty.

• Units: Candidate 1 omits the unit, but the question specifies kg m/s. We can assume Candidate 1 intends the same unit, so we can compare the numbers (Rule 1).

• Numerical comparison (Rule 4):  
  Candidate 1: 1.00000 × 10⁻²⁴  
  Candidate 2: 4.98000 × 10⁻²⁵  

Convert Candidate 1 to ×10⁻²⁵ form → 10.0000 × 10⁻²⁵.  
10.0000 ≠ 4.98000 to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two predictions are not the same.

For the given question only one numerical answer is required: the minimum number of people who must share the same birthday in a group of 1000.

Candidate 1 gives 3.

Candidate 2 gives 23.

These are distinct numerical values. Since the required answer is a single number and the two candidates provide different numbers, they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value for the Q-value:

• Candidate 1: 4.0  (implicit unit MeV, since the question asks for MeV)  
• Candidate 2: 4 MeV

The omission of the explicit unit in Candidate 1 is not ambiguous because the question specifies the unit. Numerically, 4.0 and 4 agree to six significant digits (4.00000). Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

The question is a yes/no question.  Although the number 1.0 could conceivably be interpreted as “true/yes,” this interpretation is not guaranteed or explicitly stated.  Because the two answers are expressed in different forms and Candidate 1’s meaning is ambiguous, they cannot be regarded as definitively giving the same answer under the rules (notably Rule 6 on type mismatch and ambiguity).

The two candidates give different numerical values:

• Candidate 1: 91.17  
• Candidate 2: 911.64  

Even if Candidate 1 were meant to represent 91.17 % of par, the unit is omitted and therefore ambiguous, while Candidate 2 clearly presents a dollar price (approximately 912). Under Rule 1, this unit ambiguity makes the two answers inequivalent.
The two candidates give different numerical answers:

• Candidate 1: 91.17

Candidate 1 gives the numerical answer 2.843 (no further digits).  
Candidate 2 gives a symbolic expression which, when evaluated, is approximately

(π/2)[√5 – (√2)/2 + ½ ln((2+√5)/(1+√2))] ≈ 2.842923 .

To compare, write both to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 (assuming trailing zeros): 2.84300  
• Candidate 2: 2.84292  

The two numbers differ in the fourth, fifth, and sixth significant digits, so by Rule 4 they do not match to six significant digits. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives a single numerical value 2.843 (which, to six significant digits, can be read as 2.84300).

Candidate 2 gives the exact expression 
(π/2)(√5 − √2/2 + ½ ln((2+√5)/(1+√2))),
whose numerical evaluation is approximately 2.84328… .

Comparing to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 2.84300  
• Candidate 2: 2.84328

They differ beginning at the fifth decimal place, so by Rule 4 they are not the same value. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
To compare the two answers we express them numerically to (at least) six significant digits.

Candidate 2:
(π/2)[√5 − √2/2 + ½ ln((2+√5)/(1+√2))]
≈ 2.8433157 …

Candidate 1:
2.843, which to six significant digits is 2.84300.

Comparing 2.84300 with 2.84332 (rounded form of Candidate 2), they differ in the 5-th significant digit.  
Per Rule 4, the answers must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem requires a single numerical answer (the minimum value).  
Candidate 1 gives –64.62.  
Candidate 2 gives –12√29 ≈ –64.621977…

To test equivalence we compare the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1, interpreted with trailing zeros, is –64.620000.  
• Candidate 2 to six significant digits is –64.621978 (≈ –64.621978).  

The figures differ beginning at the 5th significant digit (…620000 vs …621978).  
Hence the two answers are not the same to 6 significant digits.

The question explicitly asks for the photon energy “in eV.”  
• Candidate 1 gives “3.1” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “3.1 eV,” including the required unit.

Because both joules and electron-volts are plausible units for energy, omitting the unit introduces ambiguity. Under Rule 1, when one answer lacks the required unit and multiple units could reasonably apply, the answers are not considered equivalent.

Both answers are single real numbers with identical units.

Convert each to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 386.4158898 → 386.416 (the 7-th significant digit is 8, so the 6-th rounds up)  
• Candidate 2: 386.416 → already 386.416

The question ultimately asks whether the results “conform to the expectation” at the 5 % significance level (essentially a Yes/No decision).

• Candidate 1 answers: “True.”  
Interpreted in context, this means “Yes, they conform.”

• Candidate 2 answers: “Fail to reject the null hypothesis; the results conform to the expectation.”  
This explicitly says “Yes, they conform.”

Both candidates give the same substantive decision: the results conform to the expectation (null hypothesis not rejected). Hence, they are equivalent.

The problem asks for the eigen-values of a 3 × 3 matrix.  
A 3 × 3 matrix has three eigenvalues when algebraic multiplicities are counted.  

• Candidate 1 lists only two numbers: [2, 6].  
• Candidate 2 lists three numbers (with multiplicity): 2, 2, 6.  

Because Candidate 1 omits the repeated eigenvalue 2, the two answers are not identical.  
Under Rule 3, when multiplicity is expected (as is customary for eigenvalues of an n × n matrix), differing multiplicities make the answers inequivalent.

Reasoning:

Candidate 1 gives the value 3.464 (four significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives 2 √3 ≈ 3.464102 … .

To apply Rule 4 we must compare both answers to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1 → 3.464000 (interpreting missing digits as zeros)  
• Candidate 2 → 3.464102

The two numbers differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits (0 0 vs 1 0), so they do not match to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The numerical value of 2√3 is approximately 3.4641016.  
Candidate 1 gives 3.464 (interpreted as 3.46400 to six significant digits).  
Comparing to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 3.46400  
• Candidate 2: 3.46410  

They differ at the fifth significant digit, so the two answers are not identical according to Rule 4.
The two answers represent different numerical values when compared to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 3.464  → 3.46400 (to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 2√3 ≈ 3.46410 (to six significant digits)

Since 3.46400 ≠ 3.46410 at six-digit precision, the candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates provide a single numerical value for the wavelength.

• Candidate 1: 1850.0 (no unit given).  
• Candidate 2: 1850 nm (unit explicitly nm).

The question explicitly requests the answer “in nm,” so it is unambiguous that Candidate 1’s number is intended to be in nm. Numerically:

1850.0 nm = 1.85000 × 10³ nm  
1850 nm   = 1.85000 × 10³ nm

They match to six significant digits. Hence, the two answers are equivalent.
The question explicitly asks for the wavelength “in nm”.  
• Candidate 2 supplies both a numerical value and the unit (“1850 nm”).  
• Candidate 1 supplies only a numerical value (“1850.0”) with no unit.

According to Rule 1, if a required unit is omitted and multiple units could reasonably be used, the omission creates ambiguity and the answers are considered inequivalent.

Therefore, the two predictions are NOT equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question explicitly requests the wavelength “in nm.”  

• Candidate 2 states “1850 nm,” clearly complying with the requested unit.  
• Candidate 1 gives “1850.0” but omits any unit.  
Because wavelength can reasonably be expressed in several different units (nm, μm, m, Å, etc.), omitting the unit introduces ambiguity. Under Rule 1, when such ambiguity exists, the answers are considered inequivalent.

Both candidates give the numerical answer 1.8474, but this has only five significant digits.  
Rule 4 requires comparing real-number answers to SIX significant digits; if either answer lacks that precision, the two cannot be certified as equivalent. Since neither candidate supplies a sixth significant digit, we cannot confirm equality at the required precision.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 1.8474 → written to 6 significant digits: 1.84740  
Candidate 2: 1.847  → written to 6 significant digits: 1.84700  

Comparing digit-by-digit to 6 significant digits, they differ at the 5th digit (4 ≠ 0).  
Therefore, according to Rule 4, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 provides the list [1, 0].  
Candidate 2 states “Yes, No”.

Interpreting the conventional Boolean mapping 1 ↔ Yes and 0 ↔ No, the two responses give the same pair of answers:
• convergence in probability: 1 (Yes) vs. “Yes”  
• almost sure convergence: 0 (No) vs. “No”

Hence both candidates convey identical answers to both sub-questions.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question expects two answers: 
1. convergence in probability  
2. convergence almost surely  

Candidate 1 supplies [1, 0] (numeric list).  
Candidate 2 supplies “Yes, No” (textual answers, not formatted as a list).

Although 1/0 can be interpreted as Yes/No, Rule 2 requires that when both candidates give all answers, each answer must be **exactly identical**. “1” ≠ “Yes”, and “0” ≠ “No”. Hence the two responses are not equivalent.

The question expects (a) list of possible values.  
Candidate 1 gives decimals 0.6667 and –0.6667.  
Candidate 2 gives exact fractions 2/3 and –2/3.

Convert both to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• 0.6667  → 0.666700  
• 2/3     → 0.666667  

They differ at the sixth significant digit. The same applies to the negative values.  
Since the values do not match to six significant digits, the two candidate answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for “possible values” (plural), so each candidate correctly supplies two numbers.  
However, we must check numerical equality to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Positive value  
• Candidate 1: 0.6667 ⇒ 0.666700 (to 6 sig. digits)  
• Candidate 2: 2/3  = 0.666666… ⇒ 0.666667 (to 6 sig. digits)  

Digits differ at the 4-th significant place (7 vs 6).  
The same mismatch occurs for the negative values (–0.666700 vs –0.666667).

Since at least one of the required answers differs between the candidates, the two answer sets are not identical.

The question requires two pieces of information:
1. Initial approximations (two numbers) for the Regula-Falsi method.
2. The root correct to three decimal places.

Candidate 1 supplies only the root (“0.567”) and omits the initial approximations.
Candidate 2 supplies both initial approximations (“0 and 1”) and the root (“0.567”).

Because Candidate 1 is missing required information, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two numerical predictions differ when compared to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 30.1592 …  (six-digit form: 30.1592)  
• Candidate 2: 30.1590    (six-digit form: 30.1590)

Since the sixth significant digit differs (2 vs 0), the answers are not equivalent according to Rule 4.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give numerical answers.

Candidate 1: 30.15928896  
Candidate 2: 30.159  (which equals 30.159000 to six significant digits)

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 → 30.1593 (rounded to six significant digits)  
• Candidate 2 → 30.1590 (six significant digits)

Since 30.1593 ≠ 30.1590, the two answers are not identical to six significant digits. Therefore, they are not equivalent.

Expressed to 6 significant digits:

Both candidates give the numerical value 39.4.  
The question explicitly asks for the answer “in TeV,” so the lone number “39.4” in Candidate 1 is naturally interpreted as 39.4 TeV. There is no reasonable alternative unit that would create ambiguity here. Hence both answers represent the same quantity: 39.4 TeV.

Both candidates provide the single numerical answer “1.33”.  
• They give exactly the same value.  
• The question asks for only one number (X), and both supply that number.  
• Units are not an issue because the answer is dimensionless in the context (“X” itself).

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 9.05.  
The question explicitly asks for the distance “in terms of meter,” so it is clear that the implied unit for a bare number must be meters. Candidate 2 writes the unit “m,” while Candidate 1 omits it, but this does not introduce ambiguity because only one unit is reasonable here.  
Hence, the two answers represent the same quantity.

The question explicitly asks for the answer “in Mebibytes (MiB).”

• Candidate 1: “1.32” – supplies no unit.  
• Candidate 2: “1.32 MiB” – supplies the requested unit.

Rule 1 states that if one candidate omits a unit and that omission can introduce ambiguity (multiple units could reasonably be used), the answers are considered inequivalent. Since bytes vs MiB (and other possibilities) are reasonable alternatives, Candidate 1’s omission does create ambiguity.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question explicitly requests the result “in Mebibytes (MiB).”  

• Candidate 1 gives only the number “1.32” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “1.32 MiB,” explicitly including the required unit.

Because Candidate 1 omits the unit while the problem demands it, there is ambiguity as to whether the number is expressed in the required unit. Under Rule 1, such an omission when a specific unit is required makes the two answers not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 2.301

Expressed to six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1 → 2.30100  
• Candidate 2 → 2.30098  

They differ starting at the 4th decimal place, so they are not identical to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates provide different numerical values:

Candidate 1: 0.757000  
Candidate 2: 0.760000  

Since these differ before the sixth significant digit (indeed at the third decimal place), they are not equivalent.

The question expects multiple answers (the numbers corresponding to bounded entire functions).  
Both candidates give the same two numbers, 1 and 2, in the same order.  
The only difference is that Candidate 1 encloses them in square brackets while Candidate 2 separates them with a comma, but this does not change the content of the answer.

Therefore, the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for a single probability.  
Candidate 1 gives “1/4” and repeats the same value as “25 %”, which are numerically identical (1/4 = 0.25 = 25 %).  
Candidate 2 gives “1/4”.  

Both ultimately state the same probability value. Hence the two predictions are equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both supply expressions for two required quantities, ⟨2sₓ⟩ and ⟨2s_z⟩, so Rule 2 applies.  
Comparing each component:

1. 2s_z (expectation value)  
   • Candidate 1: ⟨2s_z⟩ = 0  
   • Candidate 2: 2s_z = 0  
   → These match.

2. 2s_x (expectation value)  
   • Candidate 1: ⟨2sₓ⟩ = −ħ sin[(2μₑ/ħ)B (t − t₀)]  
   • Candidate 2: 2sₓ =  ħ sin(ω t)

   Differences:
   • Overall sign (− versus +).  
   • Time argument: (t − t₀) versus t.  
   • Frequency: explicit 2μₑB/ħ versus unspecified ω.

   These expressions cannot be made identical for all t with the same time origin; the sign alone already makes them opposite in phase. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same list of eigenvalues (1 and 2) and the same reason for (c) (“A is Hermitian, therefore an observable”).  

However, for part (b):

• Candidate 1 states specific eigenvectors: (1, 0)ᵀ and (0, 1)ᵀ.  
• Candidate 2 merely says “the eigenvectors corresponding to the eigenvalues 1 and 2,” without specifying what those vectors are.

Because the question explicitly asks “What are the eigenstates?”, Candidate 2 does not actually supply the required explicit eigenstates, while Candidate 1 does. Thus the two answers to part (b) are not identical, so the overall responses are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 8).

The two answers give the following normalized column vectors (in the Sz basis)

Candidate 1:  (1/√2) (i,  1)^T  
Candidate 2:  (1/√2) (1,  −i)^T  

Multiplying the second by the overall phase factor i (|i| = 1) gives
i · (1/√2)(1,  −i)^T = (1/√2)(i,  1)^T,

which is exactly the vector of Candidate 1.  
Because quantum‐mechanical spinors differing only by an overall (unit-modulus) phase represent the same physical state/eigenfunction, the two candidates are equivalent.

The question asks for two items: (1) the ground-state energy and (2) the normalized wave-function.  
Both candidates give the same expression for the energy, but their wave-functions differ by an overall constant factor of \(1/\sqrt{4\pi}\). Because the wave-function must be normalized, a mere constant factor mismatch means one of them is not correctly normalized. Hence the two complete answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates supply answers for the two required quantities (ground-state energy and normalized wave function).

1. Energy:
   • Candidate 1:  E = ħ²π² / [2 m (b − a)²]  
   • Candidate 2:  E = ħ²π² / [2 m (b − a)²]  
   → Exactly the same.

2. Wave function:
   • Candidate 1:  ψ(r) = [√2 / √(4π(b−a))] · (1/r) · sin[π(r−a)/(b−a)]  
     Simplifies to  ψ(r) = [1 / √(2π(b−a))] · (1/r) · sin[π(r−a)/(b−a)].
   • Candidate 2:  ψ(r,θ,φ) = [1 / √(2π(b−a))] · (1/r) · sin[π(r−a)/(b−a)] (s-wave, angularly independent).

   After simplification, both wave functions have identical normalization factors and functional form; any omission of explicit (θ, φ) dependence in Candidate 1 merely reflects the spherical symmetry and does not change the result.

Since both sub-answers match exactly, the two candidates are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

Candidate 1 gives
σ(E)=2πħ²/(m E).

Candidate 2 gives
σ(E)=4π λ²ħ⁴/[2 m E(λ²ħ²+2 m E)]
      =2πħ²/(m E) · [λ²ħ²/(λ²ħ²+2 m E)].

For the limit requested in the problem, E→0, the ratio in brackets approaches 1, so Candidate 2 tends to exactly the same expression delivered by Candidate 1. Since the question explicitly asks for σ(E) in the limit E→0 (i.e. the asymptotic behaviour at vanishing energy), both answers supply that same limiting form.

Therefore the two predictions are equivalent for what the problem asks.

The two candidates supply answers to the twelve sub-parts, but their numerical values differ.

Examples:  
• (a) Candidate 1: 2.43 × 10⁻¹² m, Candidate 2: 2.4 × 10⁻¹² m → not identical to 6 significant digits.  
• (b) Candidate 1: 6.56 × 10⁻³¹ m², Candidate 2: 6.6 × 10⁻²⁹ m² → differ by two orders of magnitude.  
Additional discrepancies appear in several other items.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the entire sets are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 4).

Candidate 1 gives the second-order shift  
E^{(2)}(m)= (μ² ε² I/ħ²)/(4m²–1)  for every integer m.

Candidate 2 states  
• m = 0  E^{(2)} = −μ² ε² I/ħ²  
• m ≠ 0 E^{(2)} = +μ² ε² I/(3ħ²) (independent of m).

Although the two formulas coincide for m = 0 and m = ±1, they disagree for all other |m| ≥ 2 (where Candidate 1 gives 1/15, 1/35, … of μ² ε² I/ħ², not 1/3). Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

For each sub-problem we must compare the answers:

(a)  
Candidate 1: 2^{5/4}(√2 – 1)  
Candidate 2: 2^{5/4}/(1 + √2)  
Because (√2 – 1) = 1/(√2 + 1), the two expressions are identical. So the (a) answers match.

(b)  
Candidate 1:  τ = N′ π √(M/2k)  
Candidate 2:  T = n · 2π √(m/2k)

Taking M=m, Candidate 1 gives all integer multiples of π √(M/2k); Candidate 2 gives only even multiples (because of the additional factor 2). Hence Candidate 1 includes times like π √(M/2k), 3π √(M/2k) etc., which are absent in Candidate 2. The two sets of times are therefore different.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the overall predictions are not equivalent.
The question requires two separate answers.

Part (a):
• Candidate 1: 2^{5/4}(√2 – 1)  
• Candidate 2: (2^{5/4}(√2 – 1))²  

These are not the same; one is the square of the other.

Part (b):
• Candidate 1: τ = N′ π √(M/2k)  
• Candidate 2: T = n π / ω′ with ω′ = √2 ω = √(2k/M) ⇒ T = n π √(M/2k)  

These two are equivalent, but because the answers for part (a) differ, the overall sets of answers are not identical.

The two expressions are not the same.  
After simplification,

• Candidate 1 gives  
P₁ = 1024 b² e² E₀²  / [ 81 π⁴ ħ² (α² + 9 π⁴ ħ² /(64 m² b⁴)) ].

• Candidate 2 gives  
P₂ = 16 b² e² E₀²  / [ 81 π⁴ ħ² (α² + 9 π⁴ ħ² /(64 m² b⁴)) ].

The denominators are identical, but the numerators differ by a factor of 64 (1024 vs 16).  
Therefore the two predictions are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers have the same functional dependence on all variables, but the overall numerical coefficients differ:

• Candidate 1 coefficient: 1024/81  
• Candidate 2 coefficient: 256/81  

Thus Candidate 1 is larger by a factor of 4, so the two results are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not the same.

After simplifying Candidate 1,

P₁ = 1024 e²E₀²b² / [81 π⁴ ħ² ( α² + 9π⁴ħ² /(64 m²b⁴) )].

Candidate 2 is

P₂ = 256 e²E₀²b² / [81 π⁴ ħ² ( α² + 9π⁴ħ² /(64 m²b⁴) )].

Everything in the two formulas is identical except for the overall numerical factor (1024 for P₁ versus 256 for P₂). Since 1024/256 = 4, Candidate 1 predicts a probability four times larger than Candidate 2. Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem has two sub-parts, so both parts (a) and (b) must match for the candidates to be equivalent (Rule 2).

Part (a):  
• Candidate 1:  ω = 2 μ B_z / ħ  
• Candidate 2:  ω = γ B_z, with γ = 2 μ / ħ  
These are the same, so part (a) matches.

Part (b):  
• Candidate 1:  P(t) = (μ B_0 / ħ Ω)² sin²(Ω t) with Ω ≈ (ħ ω/2 + μ B_z)/ħ. On resonance, this becomes P = (B_0/2B_z)² sin²(ω t).  
• Candidate 2:  P(t) = (B_0/B_z)² sin²(ω t/2).

The amplitude factors differ by a factor of 4, and the sine arguments differ (sin²(ω t) vs sin²(ω t/2)). Hence the two probabilities are not the same.

Since the answers for part (b) are not equivalent, the overall candidate responses are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The problem has nine separate sub-questions (a)–(i).  
Both candidates supply an answer for every sub-question, so we must compare each pair.

Sub-answers (a) through (h) coincide (difference only in unit systems or notation, and the numerical values agree once units are converted).

For sub-question (i) “typical hydrogen fine-structure splitting (eV)”:

• Candidate 1: 1.8 × 10⁻⁴ eV  
• Candidate 2: 7.25 × 10⁻⁴ eV  

These two numbers differ by a factor of ≈4 and clearly do not match to six significant digits.  
Because at least one sub-answer is different, the two overall answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 2: σ_t = 3 π V₀²

The question has two sub-problems, so both candidates must supply answers for (a) and (b).  
Comparison:

(a)  
• Candidate 1: gives tan δ₀ = −k r₀  →  δ₀ = −arctan(k r₀).  
• Candidate 2: gives δ₀ = −k r₀.  
These are not the same function of k (they coincide only to first order in small k).

(b)  
• Candidate 1: tan δ_ℓ ≈ −(k r₀)^{2ℓ+1}/[(2ℓ−1)!!]²(2ℓ+1).  
• Candidate 2: states merely that δ_l vanishes “as δ_l ∝ l”, omitting the correct k-dependence and different functional form.

Thus, for both sub-answers the predictions disagree; the candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 differ for both requested parts:

a) Candidate 1 states tan δ₀ = –kr₀, whereas Candidate 2 states δ₀ = –kr₀. These are generally not the same (δ₀ = arctan(–kr₀) differs from –kr₀ except in the small-argument limit).

b) Candidate 1 gives an explicit small-k formula for tan δℓ, while Candidate 2 only says δℓ → 0. The two answers are therefore not identical.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem has two sub-questions and requires explicit quantitative answers for each.

Sub-question (a):
• Candidate 1 gives ΔEₕ𝒇𝒔 = 4 ℏ² a  
• Candidate 2 gives ΔEₕ𝒇𝒔 = 7a ⁄ 2  

These expressions are clearly different (different numerical factors and Candidate 1 includes ℏ² while Candidate 2 does not).

Since they already disagree on part (a), the two candidates’ overall answers cannot be equivalent (Rule 2). No further comparison is necessary.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has two sub-parts.  
1. Hyperfine splitting ΔE.  
2. Form of the Zeeman-split levels (only “up to a proportionality constant”).

Candidate 1: ΔE = 4 ħ² a  
Candidate 2: ΔE = 4 a

Because both candidates use the same symbol a that appears in H = a I·J, candidate 1’s answer differs by an explicit factor ħ² from candidate 2’s. Therefore their results for part (a) are not the same. Since all required parts must match to be considered equivalent (Rule 2), the two candidates are not equivalent overall.

2. Spherical basis:  
   • Candidate 1: E = ℏω (k + 1/2)  
   • Candidate 2: E = ℏω (k + 3/2)

   The constant term differs (1/2 vs 3/2), so the formulas are not the same.

2. Ground-state wave-function:

   • Candidate 2 uses the undisplaced oscillator Gaussian.

3. Two-fermion ground-state energy:

   • Candidate 2: ħω.

4. First-order correction from ΔH = εσₓ:

The answers disagree on several of the required items:

• First-order energy shift:

  – Candidate 2 gives “± K ħ / (2mω)”.  
  (Symbols ε and K are not identified with one another, so the numerical expressions are different.)

• Second-order energy shift:  
  – Candidate 1: “−2 ε² ħω”.  
  – Candidate 2: “0”.  
  (Clearly different.)

• First-order wave-function correction: the two candidates present different expressions.

Because at least one of the requested sub-answers differs, the two overall predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates differ in the factors of ħ and c² that appear in parts (a) and (b).

• Part (a)  
  – Candidate 1: cos²[(m₂ – m₁) c² t / (2ħ)]  
  – Candidate 2: cos²[(m₂ – m₁) t / 2]

• Part (b)  
  – Candidate 1: t = πħ / [(m₂ – m₁) c²]  
  – Candidate 2: t = π / (m₂ – m₁)

Candidate 2 omits ħ and c², so its expressions have different dimensions unless one assumes unstated natural-unit conventions (ħ = c = 1). Because the question itself does not specify such units, this omission leads to an ambiguity that makes the answers inequivalent under Rule 1. (Part (c) is the same, but all sub-answers must match.)

  – Candidate 1: 〈x²〉 = (ħ/2mω)[1 + (α+α*)²], 〈p²〉 = (ħmω/2)[1 – (α – α*)²]
  – Candidate 2: 〈x²〉 = (ħ/2mω)(1 + |α|²), 〈p²〉 = (ħmω/2)(1 + |α|²)

These expressions are generally unequal, so the two answers are not the same.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both supply three required quantities, but:

2. Total σ: Candidate 1’s numerator has 16 π m²g², Candidate 2 has 4 π m²g² → differ by factor 4.
3. Im f(0): Candidate 1 gives a non-zero expression; Candidate 2 says 0.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

Candidate 1:
W = [ e² |A₀|² ( …pᵢf… )² ] / ( ħ² m² c² ) · ρ(E)

Candidate 2:
Γ = [ e² ω² ] / ( 2 ħ² ) · |⟨k| r |1s⟩|² ρ(E_f)

Key differences:
1. One involves |A₀|² (vector-potential amplitude); the other involves ω².
2. One contains the momentum matrix element pᵢf, the other the position matrix element r.
3. The overall numerical prefactors (2π/ħ versus 1/2ħ², etc.) do not match.

Because these formulae are not obviously convertible into each other without additional relations and factors, they are not equivalent under the stated assumptions.

The two candidates give different formulas for the ionization rate.  The overall functional dependences and prefactors (|A₀|² versus ω², presence or absence of ħ² and m, different numerical factors, different dot products, etc.) do not match after any straightforward identifications (e.g., using p = imωr/ħ and E₀ = iωA₀/c).

The question asks for four specific items (Hamiltonian, spinor, probability, minimum field).  
To be equivalent, both candidates must supply identical answers for every item.

Comparison:

(a) Hamiltonian  
• Candidate 1:  −(γ B₀/2) cos ωt · σₓ  (off-diagonal matrix, no ħ)  
• Candidate 2:  −(γ ħ B₀/2) cos ωt · σ_z  (diagonal matrix, includes ħ)

The two matrices are different (σₓ vs σ_z, plus ħ factor). Hence the answers diverge already in part (a).

Since at least one required sub-answer is different, the full sets of predictions are not equivalent.
The question asks for four specific results (Hamiltonian matrix, time-dependent spinor, probability, and minimum field).  
We must compare each sub-answer.

1. Hamiltonian (a)  
   • Candidate 1: proportional to σₓ.  
   • Candidate 2: proportional to σ_z (the correct axis for a field along k̂).  
   → Different matrices ⇒ not equivalent.

2. Spinor (b)  
   • Candidate 1: (1/√2)[e^{+iθ}|↑⟩ + e^{−iθ}|↓⟩].  
   • Candidate 2: (1/√2)[e^{−iθ}|↑⟩ + e^{+iθ}|↓⟩].  
   The phases are interchanged; this cannot be removed by a global phase. ⇒ Different.

3. Probability (c)  
   Both give sin²[(γB₀/2ω) sin ωt]; these coincide.

4. Minimum field (d)  
   • Candidate 1: B₀ ≥ π ω/γ (no absolute value).  
   • Candidate 2: B₀ = π ω/|γ|.  
   Signs/inequality differ. ⇒ Different.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, by Rule 2 the overall answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The answers must match for every requested sub-item (a)–(d).

(a) Hamiltonian  
• Candidate 1: proportional to σₓ (off-diagonal matrix, no explicit ħ).  
• Candidate 2: proportional to σ_z (diagonal matrix), includes an overall ħ.  
These matrices are different operators; they are not the same up to a trivial phase or a missing constant.

Because the Hamiltonians already disagree, the two full answer sets cannot be equivalent (Rule 2: every sub-answer must match).

Consequently, even though the expressions given in (b)–(d) look similar, the disagreement in (a) is sufficient to declare the two candidates non-equivalent.

Candidate 1 states explicitly that the period is
T = 2 t₁
and then gives the energy spectrum
E_j = (2π n_j ħ)/T.

Candidate 2 merely says the wavefunction is periodic with period T (leaving T unspecified) and repeats that the energies are integer multiples of (2π ħ)/T, but never relates T to t₁.

Since the question requires giving the value of T, and Candidate 2 does not supply it, the two sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both sub-parts must match.

Part (a):
• Candidate 1 gives an abstract Rayleigh-quotient form  
 ω₀² ≤ ⟨ψ|Ω²|ψ⟩ / ⟨ψ|ψ⟩.  
• Candidate 2 gives an explicit Rayleigh-quotient  
 ω₀² = ∫T₀(ψ′)²dx / ∫μψ²dx.  
Although conceptually similar, the two expressions are not written identically.

Part (b):
• Candidate 1:  ω₀² ≤ 19.739 T₀/(μ₀a²).  
• Candidate 2:  ω₀² ≈ 19.74 T₀/(μ₀a²).  

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):
 Candidate 1 → 1.97390 ×10¹  
 Candidate 2 → 1.97400 ×10¹  
They differ at the 4th significant digit, so they are not equal.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question explicitly lists, for part (b),

 i f₁″ = 2 f₀′ f₁′ + (f₁′)².

Candidate 1 instead writes

 i f₁″ = 2 f₀′ f₂′ + (f₁′)²

(replacing f₁′ with f₂′ in the mixed term). Candidate 2 reproduces the equation exactly as stated in the problem.

Because one of the required sub-answers differs, the two sets of answers are not identical.  
Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.
The question requires several specific equalities for successive orders in ħ.  

Both candidates agree on the first two equalities, but differ on the third:

• Candidate 1: i f₁″ = 2 f₀′ f₂′ + (f₁′)²  
• Candidate 2: i f₁″ = 2 f₀′ f₁′ + (f₁′)²  

The presence of f₂′ in Candidate 1 contradicts the expression containing f₁′ that is required (and that Candidate 2 gives). Since one of the required sub-answers differs, the two overall answers are not identical.

• Candidate 2:  (ν_e − ν_s)/ν_s = (Φ_s − Φ_e)/c²

The only difference is that Candidate 1 uses “≈” while Candidate 2 uses “=”, but both express the identical dependence on the potential difference (same numerator Φ_s − Φ_e, same denominator c²). Under the rules, this small notation difference does not make the answers inequivalent.

Both candidates supply answers for all three sub-parts, so each must match on every individual quantity.

Part (a):
 • Rest mass: 12.1 g (C1) vs 12.12 g (C2) → 12.100000 vs 12.120000 differ to 6 significant digits.  
 • Velocity: 0.168 c (C1) vs 0.169 c (C2) → 0.168000 vs 0.169000 differ.

Part (b):
 • Both give 0.9 c (match).

Part (c):
 • C1 lists “0.185 c or 0.151 c”, whereas C2 gives 0.186 c. They do not match.

Because at least one required number in each part disagrees (Rule 4) and C1 provides multiple values for part (c) that do not coincide with C2 (Rule 2), the two answer sets are not equivalent.

Part (b): both reduce to the same condition  
 E₀ + G(r_min) = L² / (2 m r_min²),  
so the answers are equivalent for this sub-question.

Part (a): Candidate 1 supplies an expression for dr/dθ,

Candidate 2, when inverted to dr/dθ, yields
 (dr/dθ)² = 2m(E₀+G) r⁴ / L² − r² / m.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different sets of vibration frequencies.

• Candidate 1 lists three distinct fundamental frequencies:  
  – one along the field (ω₀),  
  – two transverse ones, ω₊ and ω₋ = ½[±(eB/m) + √((eB/m)² + 4 ω₀²)].  

• Candidate 2 gives one transverse frequency, ω⊥ = √(ω₀² + (qB/m)²), and one longitudinal one, ω_z = ω₀.

The single transverse frequency of Candidate 2 is not equal to either of the two transverse frequencies (ω₊, ω₋) given by Candidate 1, nor does Candidate 2 provide two separate transverse modes as Candidate 1 does. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The problem has three sub-parts, so every candidate must supply matching answers for (a), (b), and (c).

(a) Lagrangian and equation of motion  
• Candidate 1: L = ½ m b²(θ̇² + ω² sin²θ); EOM: b θ̈ − b ω² sinθ cosθ − g sinθ = 0  
• Candidate 2: L = ½ m b²(θ̇ + ω)²; EOM: θ̈ = (g/b) sinθ  

These are clearly different; Candidate 1’s kinetic energy has ω² sin²θ, whereas Candidate 2’s has (θ̇+ω)², and the equations of motion are also different.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two entire answer sets are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 1 provides both:
1. The three normal‐mode frequencies: 0, √(k/m), √(3k/m)
2. The associated mode shapes (relations among x₁, x₂, x₃).

Candidate 2 supplies only the three frequencies and omits the mode shapes entirely.

(b) three separate velocity ranges.  

Comparison:

1. Equilibrium position:  
 • Candidate 1 gives none.  
 • Candidate 2 states x = –a.  
 → Already inequivalent (Rule 2).

2. Period:  
 Candidate 1: T = 2π a √(2ma/c)  
 Candidate 2: T = 2π √(2ma³/c)  
 These are algebraically identical (a · √(2ma/c)=√(2ma³/c)), but this does not rescue equivalence because of the missing equilibrium position.

3. Velocity ranges:  
 Threshold given by Candidate 1 is √(c/(m a)); Candidate 2 uses √(c/a).  
 Thus even the numerical limits differ, and Candidate 1 also provides an extra condition “v > √(2c/(ma))” not requested.

Both candidates give a potential of the form –(constant)/r².  
If one recognises the standard notations

then

Candidate 1: V(r)= – m h² / (2 r²) = – m (L/m)² / (2 r²) = – L² /(2 m r²)

Both candidates answer the two requested sub-problems (a) and (b) and give all three Doppler–shift formulas.

(a)  Position 4-vector:  
• Candidate 2 writes the standard component form with the order (ct, x, y, z).  
• Candidate 1 supplies an explicit 4×4 matrix whose first three rows/columns are spatial and the last row/column is temporal (order (x, y, z, ct)).  When that ordering is taken into account, the transformation formulas are identical to those of Candidate 2 (x′ = γ(x − βct), ct′ = γ(ct − βx), y′ = y, z′ = z). Thus the two expressions represent the same Lorentz boost, just written with a different component ordering.

Momentum 4-vector:  
Again, Candidate 1 uses the (p_xc, p_yc, p_zc, E) ordering while Candidate 2 uses (E/c, p_x, p_y, p_z); after taking the ordering and the factor c into account, the formulas are identical:  
 E′ = γ(E − β p_x c), p′_x = γ(p_x − β E/c), p′_y = p_y, p′_z = p_z.

(b)  Doppler formulas: both candidates list exactly the three required expressions and they coincide term-by-term.

Therefore, despite the different arrangement of components, every sub-answer given by the two candidates corresponds to the same mathematical expressions.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question has two sub-parts: (a) position- and momentum-4-vector transformations, and (b) three Doppler–shift formulae.  
Both candidates give the three Doppler formulae identically, but their momentum-4-vector transformations differ:

• Candidate 2: correctly writes the fourth component as E′/c  
 E′/c = γ(E/c − β pₓ)  

• Candidate 1: writes the fourth component simply as E (un-primed) on the left-hand side, yet the right-hand side is γ(E − β pₓ c).  This equates E (un-primed) with γ(E − β pₓ c), an inconsistent and incorrect statement unless E = E′, which is generally false. Thus the transformations are not the same.

Since at least one required part (the energy component of the momentum 4-vector) is not equivalent between the candidates, Rule 2 says the overall answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for two separate things in (a): the Lorentz transformation of the position 4-vector and the corresponding transformation of the momentum 4-vector.  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give a correct expression for the position 4-vector (just written in different index orderings), but they disagree on the momentum-4-vector boost:

• Candidate 1: p′_x = γ (p_x − β E/c)  
• Candidate 2: p′_x = γ (p_x − β E/c²)

Those differ by a factor of c. Hence their answers to part (a) are not the same.  
Because one required component of the overall answer is different, Rule 2 says the full sets of answers are not equivalent.

The two proposed equations are different:

Candidate 2: y = −(ω / V) (R − x)² + V / (2 ω)

They differ both in the sign of the quadratic term and by an additional constant term V / (2 ω). Hence they describe different parabolas and are not equivalent.

The two proposed equations differ in both the power of ω (first power vs. squared) and the overall sign.  
Since these differences cannot be reconciled by any unit conversion or trivial rearrangement, the two answers are not mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give two required answers:  
1. differential cross section dσ/dΩ  
2. total cross section σ_total  

For the total cross section both say σ_total = π(R + r)², so they agree there.  
For the differential cross section:

• Candidate 1: dσ/dΩ = ¼ (R + r)² (independent of θ)  
• Candidate 2: dσ/dΩ = (R + r)² / sin²(θ/2) (strong θ-dependence)

These expressions are clearly different for almost every angle θ. Hence the candidates are not equivalent overall.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each give two required quantities:

1. Differential cross section dσ/dΩ
2. Total cross section σ_total

• For σ_total both candidates state π (R + r)² — identical.

• For dσ/dΩ:
  – Candidate 1: (1/4)(R + r)² (constant).
  – Candidate 2: (R + r)² / sin²θ (depends on θ).

These are clearly different functions of θ (they coincide only accidentally at special angles). Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem asks for two separate results:  
1. The angular distribution (dσ/dΩ).  
2. The total cross-section σ.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same total cross-section (π(R + r)²), but their angular distributions differ:

• Candidate 1: dσ/dΩ = ¼ (R + r)² (constant)  
• Candidate 2: dσ/dΩ = (R + r)² / sin²(θ/2) (θ-dependent)

These two expressions are clearly not the same function, so the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give three sub-answers, but

1. Sub-answer (a) — the Lagrangian:
   • Candidate 1:  L = T  +  G m₁m₂/|r₁–r₂|
   • Candidate 2:  L = T  –  G m₁m₂/|r₁–r₂|

   The potential term differs in sign, so the two Lagrangians are not the same function.

2. Sub-answers (b) and (c) are the same, but Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to match; because sub-answer (a) differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Therefore the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: 5.5 × 10⁻⁸ s = 0.55 × 10⁻⁷ s

2.2 × 10⁻⁷ ≠ 0.55 × 10⁻⁷ (they differ by a factor of 4).

2. Nature of the orbit: both identify it as “geostationary.”  
   (Candidate 2 merely adds standard facts—circular, period 24 h, ≈35 786 km altitude—which do not contradict Candidate 1.)

Thus the predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates supply two answers, matching the two sub-parts required.

Part (a):
• Candidate 1: 12 M_p c²  
• Candidate 2: 12  
Because the problem explicitly allows the energy to be expressed “in units of M_p c²,” a bare number 12 naturally means 12 M_p c². Thus the numeric value and intended units match.

Part (b):
• Candidate 1: 12/13  
• Candidate 2: 12/13  
These are identical.

Since every corresponding answer is the same, the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 supplies two answers—one for (a) and one for (b).  
Candidate 2 gives only a single value (“12/13”).  
Because the original question asks for two separate answers, and Candidate 2 does not provide the threshold energy requested in part (a), the two sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

• For the radial motion Candidate 1 supplies a full second-order differential equation, whereas Candidate 2 replaces it by the algebraic balance k(r–l₀)=m r ω².

Both expressions are

U₂ = –½ m ω² (x² + y²) + m ω (y ẋ – x ẏ)

Note that (x ẏ – ẋ y) = –(y ẋ – x ẏ). Therefore

–m ω (x ẏ – ẋ y) = m ω (y ẋ – x ẏ),

Reasoning:

The question asks for three separate numerical answers (with two values for part (c)), so the values must match for every sub-answer.

Comparison of the two candidates:

(a) Mean distance  
• C1: 11.2 km = 1.12 × 10⁴ m  
• C2: 1.12 × 10⁴ m  
→ Identical.

(b) Maximum muon angle  
• C1: 0.0112°  
• C2: 0.011°  
→ 0.0112 ≠ 0.011 when compared to six significant digits (or even to three); thus they differ.

(c) Neutrino momenta  
• Minimum: 1.04 × 10⁻² MeV/c (C1) vs 0.0107 MeV/c (C2) → differ.  
• Maximum: 8.54 × 10⁴ MeV/c (C1) vs 85 406 MeV/c (C2) → small but non-zero difference.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 4).

The question requires two separate answers:

(b) the minimum coefficient of friction.

• For part (a) both candidates give exactly the same expressions for the acceleration ( a ) and the tension ( T ).  
• For part (b) their formulas for μ₍min₎ are clearly different: both the numerators and denominators are algebraically unequal.

Because at least one required sub-answer (part (b)) disagrees, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.

The question requires a single numerical answer (maximum speed) in m/s.  

Candidate 1: 12.2 m/s  
Candidate 2: 12.25 m/s  

Both give values in the same unit, so we compare the numbers directly.  
Expressed to six significant digits:  

Candidate 1 → 12.2000  
Candidate 2 → 12.2500  

Since 12.2000 ≠ 12.2500 (they differ beyond the first two decimal places), they do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:

• Receptor size: 3.59 × 10⁴ m vs 3.58 × 10⁴ m

• Receptor: 3.59000 × 10⁴ ≠ 3.58000 × 10⁴

The question has three separate sub-parts and requires explicit answers for each.

Comparison of the candidates:

(a) Equation of trajectory  
• Candidate 1:  dφ/dr = h / [ r √((2r²/m)(E-U) – h²) ]  
• Candidate 2:  dr/dφ = r²/L √(2m(E-U) – L²/r²) (or, inverted, dφ/dr = L / [ r² √(2m(E-U) – L²/r²) ])  
These expressions are not the same; the powers of r and the factors of m differ, so they are inequivalent.

(b) Differential cross section definition  
• Candidate 1:  dσ/dΩ = b / sinθ |db/dθ|   (correct form)  
• Candidate 2:  dσ/dΩ = (b/dθ)²            (incorrect form)  
Not equivalent.

(c) Hard-sphere scattering  
• Candidate 1:  dσ/dΩ = a²/4 ,  σ = πa²  
• Candidate 2:  dσ/dΩ = R² / sin²(θ/2) ,  σ = πR²  
Not equivalent.

Since at least one sub-answer differs in every part, the two candidates are not equivalent.

 Candidate 2: r = √[b² + 2k/(mV₀²)]

The two candidates differ by a factor of c².

• Candidate 1: E = (5/4) m_t c²  
• Candidate 2: E = (5/4) m_t

Unless it is explicitly stated that natural units with c = 1 are being used, these two expressions represent different physical quantities (one is (5/4) times a mass, the other is (5/4) times a mass-energy). Because the question does not declare c = 1 and therefore the presence or absence of the c² factor creates an ambiguity in units, the answers are not guaranteed to be the same.

Therefore, according to Rule 1 (unit comparison), the candidates are not equivalent.
Both candidates give the same numerical coefficient, 5/4, multiplying the top-quark rest mass.  
Candidate 1 writes the factor c² explicitly, Candidate 2 tacitly uses natural units (c = 1). Since m_t c² (ordinary units) and m_t (natural units) represent the same physical energy, the two answers are physically identical once the unit convention is accounted for.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates differ by a factor of c².  
Because the problem itself compares E directly with mₜ (implying natural units in which c = 1 and mₜ already carries energy units), the extra c² in Candidate 1 changes the dimensional value. Hence the two answers are not the same.

The problem requires three distinct answers:  
1. return time for Tunnel 1,  
2. return time for Tunnel 2,  
3. statement about whether the frictionless condition is equally necessary for the two tunnels.

• For items 1 and 2, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give formulas that are algebraically identical once the relation \(M=\frac{4}{3}\pi R^{3}\rho\) is used, so they match.

• For item 3, Candidate 1 says “Only Tunnel 2 must be frictionless. Tunnel 1 does not necessarily need to be frictionless,” which means “not equally necessary.” Candidate 2 answers “Yes,” meaning it *is* equally necessary. These statements are contradictory.

Because one of the required sub-answers differs, according to Rule 2 the overall answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for two quantities:

(a) the (modified) orbital period in the presence of the additional drag‐like force  
(b) the period of the ensuing small radial oscillations

Candidate 1

• Gives three separate expressions. “answer 1” is a period containing the correction term with C; “answer 3” is a different period for radial oscillations, also with C. Thus Candidate 1 claims both periods are changed by the dust term.

Candidate 2

• For part (a) merely repeats the ordinary Kepler period 2π√(r₀³/GM), i.e. no C–dependence.  
• For part (b) provides ω = √(GM/r₀³ – 2C/r₀) (a frequency, not a period; the period would be 2π/ω). Even apart from the frequency/period mismatch, this formula is not the same functional form as Candidate 1’s result.

Hence, for both sub-questions the two candidates provide different expressions (different dependence on C, or different quantity altogether). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers identify the same critical value, α / (2πμ).  

• Candidate 2 states this value outright as the minimum.

Thus they convey the same requirement and are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates both identify the same critical expression, α / (2π μ).  

Candidate 1 phrases the result as an inequality “n ≥ α / (2π μ)” while Candidate 2 simply gives the value “α / (2π μ)”.  Both communicate that the wrap count must be at least this quantity, so they convey the same requirement for the minimum number of turns.

The question requires two separate numerical answers in part (a) and an entropy formula in part (b).

Part (a):
• Candidate 1 gives (E/N)ₘₐₓ,non-eq = ε and (E/N)ₘₐₓ,eq = ε/2.  
• Candidate 2 gives (E/N)ₘₐₓ,non-eq = ε and (E/N)ₘₐₓ,eq = ε.

The equilibrium maxima differ (ε/2 vs ε), so the answers to part (a) are not the same.

Part (b):
Both candidates give mathematically equivalent expressions for S/N (same functional form, merely written differently). However, because part (a) already disagrees, the overall answers are not equivalent per Rule 2.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The problem asks for three distinct results:
1. (E/N)ₘₐₓ without equilibrium  
2. (E/N)ₘₐₓ in equilibrium  
3. S/N as a function of E/N in equilibrium  

Both candidates give the same answers for items 1 and 2 (ε and ε/2).

For item 3:

• Candidate 1:  
 S/N = k [p ln(1/p) + (1–p) ln(1/(1–p))] with p = E/(N ε).

• Candidate 2:  
 S/N = k_B[ –(E/N) ln(E/N) – (1 – E/N) ln(1 – E/N) ].

These are not the same unless ε = 1. Candidate 1 correctly uses the dimensionless fraction p = E/(N ε), whereas Candidate 2 inserts the dimensional quantity E/N directly into the logarithms. Hence the expressions are different.

Because one of the required sub-answers (entropy formula) is not identical, the two candidate answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Since these expressions cannot in general be the same (they coincide only at a single special value β = 0), the answers are not identical for all cases demanded by the question. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives (0.3 cal, 0.24 cal).  
Converting to joules (1 cal ≈ 4.184 J):

• 0.3 cal ≈ 1.255 J  
• 0.24 cal ≈ 1.004 J  

Candidate 2 gives (41.86 J, 1.08 J).

The second numbers (~1.00 J vs 1.08 J) are close but not identical to six significant digits, and the first numbers (1.26 J vs 41.86 J) differ by more than an order of magnitude. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for three separate expressions.  
Comparing candidate answers term-by-term:

1. Entropy change of the two-level system  
   • Candidate 1: ΔS₁ = k ln(n₂ / n₁)  
   • Candidate 2: ΔS_system = k_B ln[n₂ / (n₁ + 1)]  
   These expressions differ by the “+1” in the denominator; they are not identical.

2. Entropy change of the reservoir  
   Both give ΔS_res = (E₂ − E₁) / T → identical.

3. Population ratio  
   • Candidate 1: n₂ / n₁ = exp[−(E₂ − E₁)/(k T)]  ⇒ n₁ / n₂ = exp[(E₂ − E₁)/(k T)]  
   • Candidate 2: n₁ / n₂ = exp[(E₂ − E₁)/(k_B T)]  
   These are equivalent.

Because sub-answer (a) is different, Rule 2 states the full sets of answers are not equivalent.
The question asks for three separate expressions.  

Sub-answer (a) differs:

• Candidate 1: ΔS_system = k ln(n₂ / n₁)  
• Candidate 2: ΔS_system = k ln[n₂ / (n₁ + 1)]

These are not the same expression (n₁ in the denominator vs. n₁ + 1). Although the difference becomes small for n₁ ≫ 1, they are not exactly identical, and the guidelines require exact agreement for equivalence.

Sub-answer (b) is identical, and sub-answer (c) is equivalent after reciprocation, but because at least one sub-answer differs, the full sets of answers are not equivalent according to Rule 2.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical predictions for Neptune’s surface temperature.

Candidate 2: 51 K

According to Rule 4, numerical answers must agree to six significant digits; 52.0000 ≠ 51.0000. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for a single numerical estimate of Neptune’s surface temperature.  
Both candidates give one real-number answer in Kelvin:  

• Candidate 1: 52 K  
• Candidate 2: 72 K  

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits (Rule 4) shows they differ (52 ≠ 72). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts that require:

(a) energy in terms of M and H/B  
(b) explicit expressions for both M and the energy in thermal equilibrium  
(c) heat capacity and entropy.

Comparison of the candidates:

1. Part (a): both give E = –M H (or –M B) ⇒ same.
2. Part (b):  
   • Candidate 1 supplies only the energy, not an explicit formula for M.  
   • Candidate 2 provides both M and the energy.  
   Thus Candidate 1 is missing one required answer.

3. Part (c) Entropy:  
   Candidate 1: S = Nk[ ln(e^{βμH}+e^{-βμH}) – βμH tanh(βμH) ]  
   Candidate 2: S = Nk[ ln(2 cosh(βμH)) + βμH tanh(βμH) ]  
   The first terms are identical, but the second terms have opposite signs, so the entropies differ.

Because Candidate 1 omits a required quantity (M) and the entropies disagree, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2 and content mismatch).

The question has three sub-parts.  
Sub-part (b) explicitly requires TWO answers: the total magnetic moment M and the energy E.

• Candidate 2 supplies both:  
 M = N μ₀ tanh(μ₀B/kT) and E = −N μ₀B tanh(μ₀B/kT).

• Candidate 1 gives only the energy expression and completely omits the required expression for M.

Because Candidate 1 fails to provide all required answers for sub-part (b), while Candidate 2 does, the two candidates’ responses are not fully matched. According to Rule 2, this omission makes the two candidates inequivalent, even though the overlapping formulas they do give are the same.

Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s main formula for C_vib is incomplete (missing a denominator) and uses the gas-constant R, while Candidate 2 gives a complete formula in terms of Boltzmann’s constant k.  
Even if the units (per mole vs per molecule) were reconciled, the analytic forms differ: Candidate 1 lacks the required “/(e^{θ/T}-1)^2” factor.  
Their high- and low-temperature limits also disagree (R vs k at high T).  

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: 5350 K

Both candidates give two answers, one for part (a) and one for part (b).

Part (a): √(RT / M)  
Part (b): √(γ RT / M)

Thus every requested sub-answer matches between the candidates.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each give answers for both parts (a) and (b), so we must compare every sub-answer.

Part (a):  
• Candidate 1:  c_v = (5/2) n R and c_p = (7/2) n R  
• Candidate 2:  c_v = (5/2) R and c_p = (7/2) R  

Candidate 1’s values are multiplied by n (total heat capacities), whereas Candidate 2’s are per mole. They are not the same quantities, hence not equivalent.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidate predictions are overall not equivalent.

Candidate 1 provides a long expression for δL that involves

• (dL₀/dT)  
• derivatives of frequency with respect to temperature d/dT[(4π²W/g)ν²]  
• the specific heat capacity C_W  
• δQ (heat supplied)

Candidate 2 gives a much simpler relation

δL = σQ /[(2πν)² W]

This contains none of the temperature‐derivative terms, no specific heat capacity C_W, and uses σQ rather than δQ (and σ appears nowhere in Candidate 1’s formula).

Because the two expressions contain different variables and functional dependence, they cannot be the same prediction.

• Candidate 2: 8 407 cal

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 supply different sets of answers to the multipart problem.

• Part (1):  
– Candidate 1 gives a piece-wise formula for B(M) (field as a function of magnetization), not the requested M(B).  
– Candidate 2 gives no answer at all for part (1).

• Part (2):  
– Candidate 1 only supplies some derivative expressions, without clearly stating the convexity principle or discussing consequences.  
– Candidate 2 states the principle, checks the second derivative qualitatively, and gives a discussion.

Since the two candidates do not provide the same answers for each required sub-problem (Rule 2), their responses are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates’ answers are not the same.

1. Part (1):
   • Candidate 1 produces a piece-wise formula for B as a function of M.
   • Candidate 2 gives a single linear formula for M as a function of B.
   These are different expressions and not just different rearrangements of the same equation; they disagree on functional form and on the domain structure.

2. Part (2):  
   • Candidate 1 never explicitly states the convexity principle, and its subsequent items are fragmentary.  
   • Candidate 2 states the principle, checks convexity, and discusses consequences.  
   The content is therefore different.

The question has two parts, so each candidate must supply two matching answers.

Part (a):  
Candidate 1 gives  v² = (∂p/∂ρ)ₛ.  
Candidate 2 gives  v = √(∂p/∂ρ)ₛ.  
These differ in whether v or v² is equated to the derivative; although algebraically related, they are not literally the same statement of “v”.

Part (b):  
Candidate 1: v = (1/√3)(h/m)(3N/8πV)^{1/3}.  
Candidate 2: v = (ħπ/√m)(3π² n)^{1/3}.  
These expressions are clearly different (different powers of m, different constant factors).

The question has three sub-parts, so every sub-answer must agree.

(a) Both candidates give the same definition of the partition function.

(b) Candidate 1: C_v = (1 / (k β²)) ∂² ln z / ∂β²  
    Candidate 2: C_v = (1 / (k T²)) ∂² ln z / ∂β²  

Since β = 1/(kT), 1/(k β²) = k T², not 1/(k T²). Therefore the two formulas differ by a factor of k² T⁴ and are not equivalent.

(c) After algebraic simplification, both candidates give the same expression, but the disagreement in (b) means the total answers are not fully identical.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates’ overall responses are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas:

• Candidate 1: Δp = φ² / (4 π r²)

• Candidate 2: Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)

To make them match we would need

 1 / (4 π) = ε₀ / 2  ⇒ ε₀ = 1 / (2 π)

But in SI units ε₀ ≈ 8.854 × 10⁻¹² F·m⁻¹, which is nowhere near 1/(2π) ≈ 0.159.

Thus, within a single consistent system of units the two formulas cannot be the same. They only resemble each other if one expression is written in Gaussian‐cgs units (no ε₀) and the other in SI units (with ε₀) – but the question itself does not specify differing unit systems. Therefore, under the same unit convention the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 1: Δp = φ² / (4 π r²)  (no ε₀ present)

Candidate 2: Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)  (contains ε₀ and a different numerical factor)

The presence/absence of ε₀ and the numerical coefficients (1/(4π) vs ε₀/2) mean the expressions cannot be made equal within the same unit system. Hence the answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 1: Δp = φ² / (4 π r²)

Candidate 2: Δp = ε₀ φ² / (2 r²)

Candidate 1 has a factor 1/(4 π) and no ε₀; Candidate 2 has ε₀/2. In SI units these are not equal (ε₀ ≈ 8.85 × 10⁻¹² F m⁻¹, not equal to 1/(2 π)). Unless one explicitly switches to a different unit system and reinterprets φ, they yield different numerical results for the same r and φ. Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

The question explicitly designates the latent heat “per unit volume” as the quantity L / V.  

• Candidate 1 keeps that same symbol in the denominator:  
 h(t) = √[ 2 Λ ΔT t / (L / V) ] .  

• Candidate 2 puts only L in the denominator:  
 d(t) = √[ 2 Λ ΔT t / L ].  

Unless Candidate 2 is silently redefining “L” to mean “L / V”, its formula is missing the factor V under the square root and thus differs from Candidate 1 by a factor √V in magnitude and by units. Because of this mismatch in the stated symbols/units, the two expressions are not guaranteed to be the same.
The required formula should involve the latent heat per unit volume, which the problem denotes by the ratio L / V.

• Candidate 1 uses that quantity explicitly:  
 h(t) = √[ 2 Λ ΔT t / (L / V) ] = √[ 2 Λ ΔT t · V / L ].

• Candidate 2 uses the total latent heat L in the denominator:  
 d(t) = √[ 2 Λ ΔT t / L ].

Unless V = 1 (which is not given and generally not true), the two expressions differ by a factor of √V inside the square root. Therefore the two answers are not the same.

Sub-problem (a):  
– Candidate 1: u = (E₀ + E₁ e^{-βΔE})/(1 + e^{-βΔE}).  
– Candidate 2: u = (E₀e^{-βE₀} + E₁e^{-βE₁})/(e^{-βE₀}+e^{-βE₁}) ⇒ after cancelling the common factor e^{-βE₀} this becomes the same as Candidate 1.  
⇒ Equivalent for (a).

Sub-problem (b):  
Both give the limits u → E₀ as T→0 and u → (E₀+E₁)/2 as T→∞ (Candidate 1 adds small-T / large-T corrections, but the limits are the same).  
⇒ Equivalent for (b).

Sub-problem (c):  
– Candidate 1: C = R(ΔE/kT)² e^{-ΔE/kT} /(1+e^{-ΔE/kT})² = R(ΔE)² e^{βΔE}/(k²T²(1+e^{βΔE})²).  (proportional to (ΔE)²)  
– Candidate 2: C = N(ΔE) e^{βΔE}/(kT²(1+e^{βΔE})²).  (proportional to ΔE, missing one factor of ΔE and differing overall constant)  
The formulas are not the same.  
⇒ Not equivalent for (c).

Because one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not fully equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates are not equivalent.

• Part (a):  
  – Candidate 1 gives \(N\,\Delta^{2}/(kT^{2})\,\text{sech}^{2}(\Delta/kT)\).  
  – Candidate 2 gives \(\Delta^{2}/(kT^{2})\,\text{sech}^{2}(\Delta/kT)\).  
  They differ by a factor of \(N\).

• Part (b):  
  – Candidate 1 supplies a non-zero integral expression.  
  – Candidate 2 states the result is \(0\).  
  These answers are clearly different.

Hence the two sets of answers are inequivalent.

Both candidates give answers for all sub-parts, but:

1. “Low temperature” criterion:  
   • Candidate 1: \(T_c \approx \dfrac{10\varepsilon}{k\ln N}\) (depends on \(N\)).  
   • Candidate 2: \(T \ll \dfrac{\varepsilon}{k}\).

   These are clearly different.

2. Average energy \(E(T)\):  
   • Candidate 1 keeps the \(E_3=10\varepsilon\) term.  
   • Candidate 2 neglects it.  The two formulas are not the same.

3. Specific heat \(C_v\): formulas are completely different.

4. Qualitative sketch comment agrees only in a vague sense, but because the quantitative expressions differ the answers are not equivalent.

Thus, by Rules 2 and 6, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1  
(a) Gives the reduced matrices simply as the position representation ⟨r′|ρ|r⟩ and the momentum representation ⟨p′|ρ|p⟩.  
(b) States the diagonal of the position matrix is (1/V) ∑_p f(p) (constant).

Candidate 2  
(a) Writes explicit formulas but with an incomplete/incorrect integral: ρ_pos(x,x′)=∫dp ⟨x|p⟩⟨p|x′⟩ φ(p,p′) (missing the dp′ integration). This is not the same object as ⟨x|ρ|x′⟩ given by Candidate 1.  
(b) Gives ρ_pos(x,x)= (1/2πħ)∫dp f(p) (constant).

Because their answers to part (a) are not the same (Candidate 2’s expression is not equivalent to Candidate 1’s and is actually inconsistent), the two candidates are not equivalent overall.

Sub-problem (a) differs:

• Candidate 1: U = U₀ + nE (contains an extra, unspecified constant U₀)  
• Candidate 2: U = nE (sets the reference energy to zero)

Because the two expressions are not identical (they coincide only if one arbitrarily sets U₀ = 0), the answers are not fully the same.  
For parts (b) and (c) the formulas coincide, but Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to match for overall equivalence.  
Hence the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has three sub-parts (a), (b), and (c).  
Both candidates supply answers for all three sub-parts, so we must compare each corresponding answer:

(a) Internal energy  
• Candidate 1: U = U₀ + nE  
• Candidate 2: U = nE  
They differ by the constant U₀, hence are not the same answer.

(b) Entropy  
After algebraic simplification, the two formulas are identical, so part (b) matches.

(c) Number of defects  
Both give n = N / (1 + e^{E/2kT}); these match.

Because the answers for part (a) are different, under Rule 2 the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: 1.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ s  
40 vs 1.5 → different (do not match to 6 significant digits).

Candidate 2: 5.85000 × 10³⁵ m⁻³

   Candidate 1 = 114 W → 114.000 (to 6 sig. fig.)  
   Candidate 2 = 114.4 W → 114.400  
   Values differ (beginning at the 4th significant digit).

2. Entropy rate – hot water:  
   -0.314 W/K vs -0.315 W/K → -0.314000 vs -0.315000 (differ at 4th significant digit).

3. Entropy rate – insulation: both 0 W/K (match).

4. Entropy rate – room: 0.403 W/K vs 0.404 W/K → 0.403000 vs 0.404000 (differ).

5. Entropy rate – universe: both 0.089 W/K (match).

The question asks for two distinct results:  
(a) the partition function Z, and  
(b) the average number of open links ⟨n⟩.

Comparison:

1. Partition function (a):  
   • Candidate 1: \(Z = \frac{1-e^{-\beta (N+1)\epsilon}}{1-e^{-\beta\epsilon}}\)  
   • Candidate 2: \(Z = \frac{1-e^{-\beta (N+1)\epsilon}}{1-e^{-\beta\epsilon}}\)  
   These are identical.

2. Average number of open links (b):  
   • Candidate 1: \(\langle n\rangle \approx \frac{1}{e^{\beta\epsilon}-1}\)  
   • Candidate 2: \(0\)  
   These are clearly different.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give exactly the same expression for the partition function

Z = (1 − e^{−β ε (N+1)}) / (1 − e^{−β ε}).

For the second part, the question explicitly asks for the result “in the limit ε ≫ τ.”  
• Candidate 2 states ⟨n⟩ = e^{−β ε}.  
• Candidate 1 gives ⟨n⟩ ≈ 1/(e^{β ε} − 1).  

In the stated large-β ε limit we have  
1/(e^{β ε} − 1) ≈ e^{−β ε},  
so Candidate 1’s approximate expression reduces to Candidate 2’s result. Hence, within the required limit the two answers coincide. Therefore the two sets of answers are equivalent.

The question asks for four sub-answers ((a)–(d)).  
Both candidates give explicit answers for every sub-part.

Sub-parts (a)–(c): the two candidates give identical expressions.

Sub-part (d) – final temperature τ_f:

• Candidate 1:  
τ_f = τ_i [1 − (5/(8 π²)) (N_s/N_p)(μB/τ_i)² (τ_D/τ_i)³]^{1/3}

• Candidate 2:  
τ_f = τ_D [(τ/τ_D)³ − (N_s μ² B²)/(2 τ² · (4/5) π⁴ N_p)]^{1/3}

After algebraic simplification, Candidate 2 becomes  
τ_f = τ [1 − (5/(8 π⁴))(N_s μ² B² τ_D³)/(τ⁵ N_p)]^{1/3}.

Thus the two expressions differ by the factor π² vs π⁴, so they are not equivalent.

Since at least one required answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question has two sub-parts (a) and (b).  
To be equivalent, both candidates must match on both parts.

Part (a):
• Candidate 1: 𝐐̇ = π r_A r_B K (T_A – T_B)/L  
• Candidate 2: 𝐐̇ = π r_A r_B K (T_B – T_A)/L  

These differ by an overall minus sign, so they are not the same expression (unless T_A = T_B, which is not generally true). Hence the answers to part (a) are inequivalent.

Part (b):
Both give 60 °C (candidate 1 via formula, candidate 2 directly), so they match here.

Because they disagree on part (a), the overall answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

These differ by an overall minus sign. Since the problem statement does not specify that only magnitude matters, the two formulas are not identical.

Part (b):
• Candidate 1: T_C = (T_A + 2 T_B)/3 ⇒ 60 °C for the given data.

These are not the same function of x.

Sub-problem (b):

For part (a):

These differ because Candidate 1’s denominator is (1 + x)⁴, whereas Candidate 2’s is (x + λ)⁴, and Candidate 2 also has an extra λ³ factor in the numerator.

For part (b):
• Candidate 1: P₄ = (x / (1 + x))⁴  
• Candidate 2: P₄ = (x / (x + λ))⁴  

Again, the denominators are different, leading to different results.

• Contains exponentials in ε₀, but also polynomial dependence on p.

Candidate 2:

Since one answer varies with pressure while the other does not, they cannot represent the same function. Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

The two proposed formulas give different results even on a simple test case.

Take G₁ and G₂ to be single-vertex (edgeless) graphs, so n₁ = n₂ = 1.  
Then the join G₁ + G₂ is K₂, whose chromatic polynomial is x(x−1).

Candidate 1 gives
μ = [x(x−2)] / (x−1)² · (x−1)(x−1) = x(x−2) = x² − 2x.

Candidate 2 gives
μ = x(x−1) + x(x−1) − (x−1)² = x² − 1.

Since x² − 2x ≠ x² − 1, the two expressions are not the same.

Even if we try to interpret answer 1 as the value when n = 3^m and answer 2 for the other case, the values (1 and 2m − 1) do not match the corresponding expressions (m + 2 and m + 3) from Candidate 1 for any general m. Hence the two candidates are not providing equivalent predictions.

The two formulas are structurally different.

1. Candidate 1 gives a piece-wise definition (off–diagonal sum vs. 0 on the diagonal) and the term in the sum is  
   (-1)^{(|E(P)|–1)/2} hα(P).

2. Candidate 2 gives a single formula for every pair (i,j) with summand  
   (-1)^{length(P)} α^{length(P)}.

Thus:
• The parity exponent differs: (|E|–1)/2 versus length(P).  
• The weight differs: hα(P) versus α^{length(P)}.  
• Candidate 1 forces diagonal entries to be 0, Candidate 2 does not.

These cannot be reconciled by simple algebraic conversion without extra assumptions that are not stated. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidate formulas are clearly different expressions:

• Candidate 1: 1 + Σ(2^{a_i} − 1) + Σ_{i<j}(2^{a_i} − 1)(2^{a_j} − 1)
• Candidate 2: a₁ + a₂ + … + aₙ

For instance, when n = 1, Candidate 1 gives 2^{a₁}, whereas Candidate 2 gives a₁; these are not equal for general a₁. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

• Candidate 1: 1 + ∑_{i=1}^{n}(2^{a_i} − 1) + ∑_{1≤i<j≤n}(2^{a_i} − 1)(2^{a_j} − 1)

• Candidate 2: a₁ + a₂ + … + aₙ

For n = 1, Candidate 1 simplifies to 2^{a₁}, while Candidate 2 is a₁. Since 2^{a₁} ≠ a₁ for any positive integer a₁, the two formulas are not the same in general. Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for a numerical formula (in terms of n, using the floor function) for the cardinality.  
Each candidate supplies exactly one such formula, so we compare those two formulas directly.

Candidate 1: ⌊(2^{n-1}·5)/3⌋  
Candidate 2: ⌊(2n+1)! / 2^{n+1}⌋  

These are clearly different expressions. For example, at n = 2:

• Candidate 1 gives ⌊5·2/3⌋ = ⌊10/3⌋ = 3.  
• Candidate 2 gives ⌊5!/2^{3}⌋ = ⌊120/8⌋ = 15.

Since their values diverge, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different rational functions.  
After bringing each to a common denominator and expanding, the coefficients of the resulting polynomials differ (for example, the coefficient of x² is –3 in Candidate 1’s cross-product but –2 in Candidate 2’s).  
Hence the two expressions are not the same generating function.

The two candidates present different rational functions.

Candidate 1: (1 − x² + 2x³)/[(1 − x)(1 − 2x² − x⁴)]  
Denominator degree = 5 and contains a factor (1 − x).

Candidate 2: x(1 + 2x)/(1 − 2x²) = (x + 2x²)/(1 − 2x²)  
Denominator degree = 2 and has no factor (1 − x).

Because Candidate 1 has an unavoidable (1 − x) factor in the denominator (its numerator is not divisible by 1 − x) while Candidate 2 does not, the two rational functions cannot be identical. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a fixed numerical answer “3”.

The two candidates give different numerical expressions:

• Candidate 1: σ(D₂ₙ) = 3 (a fixed constant)

The question asks for a single value (or formula) of σ(D₂ₙ) when n is even. 

• Candidate 1 gives the constant value 3.  
• Candidate 2 gives the expression n + 1.

Since 3 ≠ n + 1 for general even n (they are equal only when n = 2, not in general), the two answers are different numeric results for the same quantity.

Therefore, under Rule 4 (comparison of numeric results), the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 asserts a constant value “3,” independent of n.  
Candidate 2 asserts “n + 1,” which varies with n and equals 3 only when n = 2.  
Since the answers differ for all other values of even n, they are not equivalent.

The problem asks for two things:
1. A formula for β_{i,i+2}(J_G) for every i ≥ 0.
2. The values of β_{i,j}(J_G) when j ≠ i+2.

Both candidates give answers to both parts, but their formulas for β_{i,i+2}(J_G) differ:

• Candidate 1: β_{i,i+2} = (i+1)·C(n, i+2)  
• Candidate 2: β_{i,i+2} = C(n−2, i)

To test equivalence, compare the two expressions symbolically:

(i+1)·C(n, i+2)  
= (i+1) · n! / [(i+2)!(n−i−2)!]  
= n! / [(i+2)·i!·(n−i−2)!]  
= n(n−1)(n−2)! / [(i+2)·i!·(n−i−2)!]

C(n−2, i)  
= (n−2)! / [i!·(n−i−2)!]

The ratio of Candidate 1 to Candidate 2 is n(n−1)/(i+2).  
Since this is not identically 1 for all n and i, the two formulas are not the same. Hence the candidates’ answers disagree on β_{i,i+2}(J_G).

Because one required component differs, the two overall answers are not equivalent.

The two proposed formulas for Δ⁻¹ are completely different matrix expressions:

• Candidate 1: Δ⁻¹ = –¼ L( ĥτ ⊗ I_s )L + ¼ η β⁻¹ η′  
• Candidate 2: Δ⁻¹ = ( η – β I )⁻¹

No standard algebraic identity turns one of these expressions into the other, and they involve different combinations of L, β, and η (candidate 2 doesn’t even contain L explicitly). Hence the answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives   
Δ⁻¹ = –¼ L(ĥτ ⊗ I_s)L + ¼ η β⁻¹ η′.

Candidate 2 gives only  
Δ⁻¹ = η / β  (i.e. essentially η β⁻¹).

The two formulas are plainly different: candidate 1 has the extra –¼ L(ĥτ ⊗ I_s)L term and an overall ¼ factor in front of the η β⁻¹ η′ part, whereas candidate 2 lacks the L-term and the ¼ factor and also transposition. Hence the expressions are not the same.

Candidate 2 uses  
     sup_{‖f‖≤1,   g ≤1}                                                                                                               
( no denominator )

Because T is bilinear in each argument, scaling either f or g by a factor ≤1 scales ‖T(f⊗g)‖ by the same factor, so the supremum without the denominator is always achieved when ‖f‖=‖g‖=1.  
For those pairs the denominator in Candidate 1 equals 1, making both expressions identical:
 sup_{‖f‖=1,‖g‖=1}‖T(f⊗g)‖.

Hence the two norms produced are equal.  
Since part (a) also matches, the two candidates provide equivalent answers overall.

Both Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the single numerical answer 0.  
The question asks for one number (the count of solutions), and both candidates provide the same count with no unit ambiguity.

Candidate 1 asserts  
 infₓ [f(x)+g(Ax)] = − minᵤ [f* (−Aᵀu)+g*(u)].

Candidate 2 asserts  
 infₓ [f(x)+g(Ax)] = minᵤ [f* (−Aᵀu)+g*(u)].

The two expressions differ by an overall minus sign on the right-hand side, so they cannot both be true simultaneously. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
mult(R/I^s) = mult(R/I)·C(h+s–1, s–1)

Candidate 2 gives  
mult(R/I^s) = mult(R/I)·s^h

For h > 1 and general s these two factors, C(h+s–1, s–1) and s^h, are not the same (e.g., for h=2, s=2: C(3,1)=3 while 2^2=4). Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different series:

• Candidate 1: S(q) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ n q^{n(n+1)/2}.  
  – first few terms: q¹ + 2q³ + 3q⁶ + 4q¹⁰ + …

• Candidate 2: S(q) = ∑_{n=1}^∞ q^{3n}.  
  – first few terms: q³ + q⁶ + q⁹ + q¹² + …

The exponents and coefficients do not match term-by-term (e.g., the first power of q in Candidate 1 is q¹ with coefficient 1, while Candidate 2 starts at q³ with coefficient 1). Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions are different functions of m and n.  
For example, with m = 2 and n = 1:

• Candidate 1 gives P = 1 − (2·1·1⁰ + 0¹)/2¹ = 1 − 2/2 = 0.  
• Candidate 2 gives P = 2·1 / (2·1) = 1.

Since the results already disagree for this single choice of m and n, the formulas are not equivalent.
The two expressions are not the same.  
For example, take n = 1 (with any m ≥ 2):

• Candidate 1 gives   
 P(A_{ij}) = 1 − [ 2·1·(m−1)^0 + (m−2)^1 ] / m^1  
      = 1 − ( 2 + m − 2 ) / m  
      = 1 − m / m = 0.

• Candidate 2 gives P(A_{ij}) = 1 / m, which is non-zero.

Since they already disagree for n = 1 (and likewise for other n), the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two proposed expressions are not the same.  
For example, if \(m = 2,\; n = 1\):

• Candidate 1:  
\(P = 1 - \dfrac{2(1)(1)^{0} + (0)^{1}}{2^{1}} = 1 - \dfrac{2}{2} = 0.\)

• Candidate 2:  
\(P = \dfrac{1}{2}.\)

Since \(0 \neq \tfrac12\), the formulas cannot be equivalent (and the mismatch persists for other \(m,n\) as well).
The two candidates give completely different formulas:

Candidate 1  
|φ^{-1}(2k)| = 14·4^k − 14·2^k + 4  
|φ^{-1}(2k+1)| = 28·4^k − 20·2^k + 4  

Candidate 2  
|φ^{-1}(2k)| = 4 × (# of representations of 2k as a sum of two squares)  
|φ^{-1}(2k+1)| = 8 × (# of representations of 2k+1 as a sum of two squares)

These expressions are not obviously the same. Indeed, plugging k = 1:

• Candidate 1 gives |φ^{-1}(2)| = 32.  
• Candidate 2 gives |φ^{-1}(2)| = 4 × r₂(2) = 4 × 4 = 16 (using the usual count of ordered pairs with signs).

They differ, so the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different functional forms:

• Candidate 1:  (i π)/(2 λ) · H₀^{(1)}(i λ ρ) · sinh(λ t)

 – Hankel argument: i λ ρ  
 – sinh argument: λ t

• Candidate 2:  (1/(2 λ)) · sinh( (ρ t)/(2 λ) ) · H₀^{(1)}( (ρ t)/(2 λ) )

 – Hankel argument: (ρ t)/(2 λ)  
 – sinh argument: (ρ t)/(2 λ)

The arguments and overall factors are unrelated; there is no standard identity equating these two expressions for general ρ, t, λ. Hence the answers are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions.

Using the standard relation
 H₀^{(1)}(i z) = -(2 i / π) K₀(z),

candidate 1 becomes
 (i π)/(2λ) · H₀^{(1)}(iλρ) = (i π)/(2λ) · [-(2 i/π) K₀(λρ)]
                = (1/λ) K₀(λρ).

So candidate 1 is (sinh(λt)/λ)·K₀(λρ).

Candidate 2 is (π/(2λ))·e^{-λρ}·sinh(λt).

K₀(λρ) is not equal to (π/2) e^{-λρ} (their behaviors differ, e.g. K₀ diverges logarithmically as its argument →0 while e^{-λρ} stays finite). Hence the two expressions are not the same.

The two candidates give different symbolic expressions for I:

Candidate 2:  I = G/2

Setting them equal would require −(π/6) ln 2 = (13/18) G, which is false numerically (left side ≈ −0.502, right side ≈ 0.915965 × 13/18 ≈ 0.661). Hence the two answers are not the same.

The two candidates give different formulas.

Example with m = 1:

• Candidate 1: I(1)= −2 ln 2 + (3/2) ζ(2)  
• Candidate 2: I(1)= 3 ζ(3)

These are clearly not the same number (they even involve different zeta values). Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
The two formulas are clearly different.

For example, when m = 1

• Candidate 1 gives  
I(1)=−2 ln 2 + π²/4

• Candidate 2 gives  
I(1)= (3/2) ζ(3) − (2 π²)/3

These two expressions are not the same (they even involve different transcendental constants). Hence the candidates are not equivalent for general m.

Candidate 2 is simply the defining series
 Li₂(e^{-π}) = Σ_{n=1}^{∞} e^{-π n}/n².

Candidate 1 rewrites Li₂(e^{-π}) as the sum of three parts:
 (1) –π²/12,
 (2) π[log(sinh(π/2))+log 2 – 1],
 (3) π·lim_{N→∞}{πN(N+1) – 2N – 4 Σ_{k=1}^{N} k arctan(2k)}.

Whether that long limit, together with the stated constants, really equals Li₂(e^{-π}) is not evident and certainly not trivially the same object as the simple series in Candidate 2. The two expressions are not manifestly identical, and no derivation equating them has been provided.

Therefore the two candidates cannot be regarded as equivalent answers.

The two candidates give different explicit expressions for the value of the integral.

• Candidate 1: ½ Cin(2π), where Cin(x) = ∫₀ˣ (1 – cos t)/t dt.  
 Numerically, Cin(2π) ≈ 2.43658, so ½ Cin(2π) ≈ 1.21829.

• Candidate 2: π²/8 ≈ 1.23370.

Comparing the numeric values to six significant digits:  
1.21829 ≠ 1.23370.

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different explicit expressions for the value of the integral:

• Candidate 1: ½ Cin(2 π)  
• Candidate 2: π ⁄ 2

Using the standard definition Cin x = ∫₀ˣ(1 – cos t)/t dt, one finds numerically
Cin(2 π) ≈ 2.43409, so ½ Cin(2 π) ≈ 1.21705.

Meanwhile π ⁄ 2 ≈ 1.570796.

The two numbers differ well beyond 6 significant digits, so they are not equal.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give distinctly different numerical results.

• Candidate 1:  (Cin(2π))/2  ≈ 1.218 (approximately)  
• Candidate 2:  π/2 ≈ 1.571  

These values do not match to six significant digits (or even to one), so the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different analytic expressions:  

Candidate 1: ½ Cin(2π)  
Candidate 2: (π/2)(1 + J₀(π))

Evaluating numerically (using known values Cin(2π) ≈ 2.4349 and J₀(π) ≈ –0.304242):

• Candidate 1 ≈ ½ × 2.4349 ≈ 1.2174  
• Candidate 2 ≈ (π/2) × 0.695758 ≈ 1.093

Since 1.2174 and 1.093 differ well beyond 6 significant digits, the expressions are not equal. Therefore the two candidates are inequivalent.

The two answers differ in notation:

• Candidate 1: “log(2 + i)” – the base of “log” is not specified and can commonly mean base 10 or base e (or something else) depending on convention.  
• Candidate 2: “ln(2 + i)” – explicitly the natural logarithm (base e).

Because the question does not state which base is intended, Candidate 1’s use of an unspecified “log” introduces ambiguity, while Candidate 2 clearly specifies the natural logarithm. According to Rule 1, when such ambiguity exists the answers are considered inequivalent.

• Candidate 2 is simply −2 π k H₀(a k).

They depend on different combinations of special functions and even use different arguments (√2 a k vs. a k). There is no known identity that would turn Candidate 1 into Candidate 2, so the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a specific numerical constant:  
(π / 2²⁴) · C(25, 4).

Candidate 2 gives a parametric family of constants:  
(π / 2^{2k+1}) · C(2k, k), with an unspecified integer k.

Because Candidate 2 does not assign a particular value to k, its result is ambiguous and, for any integer k, cannot match the form of Candidate 1’s numerical value (the power of 2 in the denominator of Candidate 2 is always odd, whereas it is even—24—in Candidate 1). Hence the two answers are different.

Candidate 1 gives a specific numeric constant:  
(π · C(25, 4)) / 2²⁴.

Candidate 2 supplies a one-parameter family of constants:  
(π/2) · C(2n, n) · 2⁻²ⁿ, which still depends on the unspecified variable n.

Since Candidate 2’s result is not a single fixed value (it varies with n) and cannot, in general, be the same constant as Candidate 1 without choosing a particular n, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates differ only by the (arbitrary) constant of integration “+ C”, which is always allowed—and often omitted—when giving an antiderivative.  Since any antiderivative is defined only up to an additive constant, the expression  

−cos((n + 1)x)/(n + 1)

is a perfectly valid representative of the family  

−cos((n + 1)x)/(n + 1) + C.

Hence the two answers represent the same mathematical result.

Because the sets of answers are not identical (Candidate 1 allows –1 as well), the two candidates are not equivalent.

Since ζ(2) = π²/6, Candidate 1 equals (π²/6)/2 = π²/12 ≈ 0.822467, whereas Candidate 2 equals π²/6 ≈ 1.644934.  
Comparing to 6 significant digits, 0.822467 ≠ 1.64493.

Candidate 1 gives a very long expression that explicitly contains imaginary terms (factors of i), e.g.  (i π³)/12 and 6 i π( … ).  
The integral in the problem is real, so a correct closed-form must be purely real.  
Candidate 2 produces a purely real expression with no imaginary unit.

Because Candidate 1 is (unless massive further cancellation occurs) complex-valued while Candidate 2 is real, the two answers cannot be equal. Hence they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates present completely different closed-form expressions.

• Candidate 1 contains many additional special functions (Li₂, Li₃, ζ(3)), an ArcCoth term, logarithms of 3 and 2 in various combinations, and even explicit imaginary terms (i π³, i π …).  
• Candidate 2 is a simple real combination  π²/12 – (ln 2)²/2 .

Because Candidate 1 involves extra constants/functions not present in Candidate 2 and even includes imaginary parts that have no counterpart in Candidate 2, the two expressions cannot be the same real number. Hence they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the antiderivative as

Both candidates give the antiderivative as the arcsine (inverse sine) of aᵡ divided by ln a, plus an arbitrary constant:

• Candidate 1:  (sin⁻¹(aᵡ)) / (ln a) + C  
• Candidate 2:  (1/ln a) · arcsin(aᵡ) + C

Here sin⁻¹(·) and arcsin(·) are two standard notations for the same inverse-sine function, and 1/ln a multiplied in front is identical to division by ln a. Thus the two expressions are mathematically identical (up to the additive constant).

The two candidates give different explicit expressions:

Candidate 1:  (5/3) ζ(3) – (π/3) Cl₂(2π/3)

Candidate 2:  (11/12) ζ(3)

Using the known numerical values ζ(3) ≈ 1.2020569 and Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 0.6766, we find

Candidate 1 ≈ 1.294893  
Candidate 2 ≈ 1.101885  

These differ already in the third decimal place, far beyond the 6-significant-digit criterion of Rule 4. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

Candidate 1:  (5/3) ζ(3) − (π/3) Cl₂(2π/3)  
Candidate 2:  (11/9) ζ(3)

Using the series definition of the Clausen function, one finds numerically  
Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 0.676000.  Hence

Candidate 1 ≈ (5/3)·1.2020569 − (π/3)·0.676000  
             ≈ 2.00343 − 0.70700 ≈ 1.29643.

Candidate 2 ≈ (11/9)·1.2020569 ≈ 1.46802.

The two numerical values differ well beyond six significant digits, so the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different closed-form expressions:

Candidate 2:           2 ζ(3)  −  (π² ln 2)/3

For the two answers to be equivalent, the following identity would have to hold:

ζ(3) + π Cl₂(2π/3) = π² ln 2.

Numerically,
ζ(3) ≈ 1.2020569  
Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 0.678 (hence π Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 2.13)  
ζ(3) + π Cl₂(2π/3) ≈ 3.33,

while
π² ln 2 ≈ 6.84.

Since these values differ greatly, the required identity is false, so the two expressions are not equal. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Since e^{−μ} equals 1/e^{μ}, the two expressions are identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

The two candidates give completely different integral formulas.

Candidate 1:
l(r)=−∫_{r}^{∞}dr₂∫_{0}^{r₂}(r₁/r₂)^{d−1}s(r₁)dr₁

Candidate 2:
l(r)=∫_{0}^{∞} [1/(4π^{d/2}Γ(d/2))] ρ^{2−d} s(r′) r′^{d−1}dr′ (with ρ left undefined)

Candidate 1 matches the standard radial-Poisson solution (it has the inner/outer integrals with the factor (r₁/r₂)^{d−1}).  
Candidate 2 instead uses the fundamental Green’s function kernel |r−r′|^{2−d} but omits the necessary angular integration, gives a different constant factor, and even leaves ρ undefined. Therefore the two expressions are not mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two formulas are structurally different.

Candidate 1 contains a double integral that, after exchanging the order of integration, splits into two separate contributions: one from 0 to r and another from r to ∞.  
Candidate 2, however, involves only a single integral from 0 to r and lacks the second (r to ∞) term. In addition, the multiplicative r–dependence in front of the integral (factor −1/(d−2) r^{−(d−2)} in Candidate 1 vs. (1/(d−2))(1−r^{d−2}) in Candidate 2) is not the same.

Because the two expressions differ in both structure and r–dependence, they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different integral kernels for the radial solution.

• Candidate 1 expresses l(r) with a double integral that, after swapping the order of integration, becomes proportional to  
  r^{-(d-2)}∫_0^{r} s(t)t^{d-1}dt  + ∫_{r}^{∞} s(t)t dt.

• Candidate 2 uses a single integral kernel |r–r′|^{-(d-2)} (times a constant) obtained by inserting the full-space Green’s function before doing the angular average. For a purely radial source, the correct angular integration does not reduce simply to |r–r′|^{-(d-2)}; instead it yields the piecewise “inside/outside” form embodied in Candidate 1.

Thus the two formulas are not the same (even ignoring the overall constants). Hence the candidates are inequivalent.
The problem asks for a single positive real constant a.  
Candidate 1 gives a numerical approximation  
 a ≈ 0.709 890  

Candidate 2 gives a closed form  
 a = 3 / tan(π / e)

To see whether these are the same number, evaluate the expression in Candidate 2 approximately:

π / e ≈ 3.1415926536 / 2.7182818285 ≈ 1.155727 rad  
tan(1.155727) ≈ 2.27 (using standard series/known values)  
Hence 3 / tan(π / e) ≈ 3 / 2.27 ≈ 1.32

The value 1.32 differs greatly from 0.709890; they do not match to six significant digits (nor even to one).  
Both candidates supply a single value, so Rule 2 is satisfied, and numerical comparison (Rule 4) shows disagreement.  

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
According to Rule 4, compare the two numerical answers to 6 significant digits.

• Candidate 1: 0.70989 → 0.709890  
• Candidate 2: 1 → 1.000000

0.709890 ≠ 1.000000, so the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different numerical values for a:

• Candidate 1: a ≈ 0.709890  
• Candidate 2: a = cot(π / e) ≈ 0.4404…

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4), 0.709890 ≠ 0.440373, so the answers are not equivalent.

Both responses are supposed to give a definite, n-independent value for the limit.  

• Candidate 1 states the value as the infinite series  ∑ₖ 1/k² = π²/6.  
• Candidate 2 provides π²/6 plus extra terms that still contain n ( 7π⁴/(360 n²)+⋯ ). Because n appears explicitly, Candidate 2 has not actually given a single constant for the limit; the expression depends on n unless n → ∞ is applied afterward.

Therefore the two answers are not identical and are treated as inequivalent.
Both candidates represent the same mathematical quantity:

• Candidate 1:  ∑_{k=1}^{∞} 1/k²  
• Candidate 2:  π² / 6  

It is a well-known identity that  
∑_{k=1}^{∞} 1/k² = ζ(2) = π² / 6 ≈ 1.644934.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

The two proposed antiderivatives are

Candidate 1:  (6/25) e^{x/2} (3 cos x + 4 sin x)^{2/3} + C  
Candidate 2:          e^{x/2} (3 cos x + 4 sin x)^{1/3} + C

They differ in two essential ways:

1. The power of the factor (3 cos x + 4 sin x) is 2/3 in Candidate 1 but 1/3 in Candidate 2.
2. Candidate 1 includes an overall constant factor 6/25, while Candidate 2 does not.

Because the exponent of (3 cos x + 4 sin x) is different, the ratio of the two expressions depends on x, i.e.

(Candidate 1)/(Candidate 2) = (6/25)(3 cos x + 4 sin x)^{1/3},

which is not a constant. Hence the two expressions cannot differ only by an additive constant; therefore they are not equivalent antiderivatives.

• Candidate 1:  e^{ i π γ / 2}  
• Candidate 2:  e^{– i π γ / 2}

Candidate 1: (1/2)(1+1/a) β(1 − a, 2a + 1) Hₐ  
Candidate 2: β(1 − a, 2a + 1) Hₐ  

Since β(1 − a, 1+2a) = β(1 − a, 2a + 1), the only difference is the extra factor (1/2)(1+1/a) = (a+1)/(2a).  
This factor equals 1 only at a = 1; for general a it is not 1. Therefore the two expressions are not equivalent for the range of a implied by the question.

Candidate 1 gives  

I₁ = ½ β(1−a, 1+2a) (1+1/a) Hₐ ,

whereas Candidate 2 gives

Comparing the two:

β(1−a, 1+2a)/β(−a, 2a+1) = −a/(1+a).

Hence  

I₁ = ½ (1+1/a)·[−a/(1+a)] Hₐ β(−a, 2a+1) = −½ Hₐ β(−a, 2a+1) = −½ I₂.

So I₁ = −½ I₂, i.e. the two candidates differ by a factor −½ and are therefore not equivalent.

After rewriting Candidate 1

 π²/4 − π(√2 − 1) − π ln(4 − 2√2)

and comparing with Candidate 2

 π²/8 − π/2 + 1 + π ln(1+√2) − (5π/4) ln 2 ,

the difference is

 Δ = π²/8 + π(3/2 − √2) − 1 − (π/4) ln 2 ,

The two expressions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1:
I₁ = − 2π / (3√3) + [7 ψ₁(1/3) − ψ₁(1/6)] / (4π√3)

Candidate 2:
I₂ = (π / √3) [ ψ₁(1/3) − ψ₁(2/3) ]

Using the trigamma multiplication relation  
ψ₁(1/6) + ψ₁(2/3) = 4 ψ₁(1/3) ⇒ ψ₁(2/3) = 4 ψ₁(1/3) − ψ₁(1/6),

we rewrite Candidate 2 as  
I₂ = (π / √3)[ψ₁(1/6) − 3 ψ₁(1/3)].

Comparing this with Candidate 1 shows entirely different combinations of constants and trigamma values; numerical checks (to six significant digits) likewise show different values. Therefore the answers are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not the same.

Let  
A = ψ₁(1/3), B = ψ₁(2/3), D = A − B.

Candidate 2 gives  
I₂ = (π/√3) D.                                           (1)

For Candidate 1, use the duplication formula  
ψ₁(1/6) + ψ₁(2/3) = 4 ψ₁(1/3)  ⇒  ψ₁(1/6) = 4A − B.

Insert this into Candidate 1’s numerator:

7A − ψ₁(1/6) = 7A − (4A − B) = 3A + B = 2(A + B) + ( A − B )
              = 2·(4π²/3) + D = 8π²/3 + D.

Hence Candidate 1 gives

I₁ = [8π²/3 + D]/(4π√3) − 2π/(3√3)
    = (2π/3) + D/(4π) − 2π/3
    = D/(4π√3).                                         (2)

Comparing (1) and (2):

I₂ = (π/√3) D        whereas        I₁ = D/(4π√3),

so I₂ = 4π² I₁.  Since D ≠ 0, the two candidates differ by the non-unit factor 4π².

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different mathematical expressions:

Candidate 1: 
I = -2π/(3√3) + [7 ψ₁(1/3) – ψ₁(1/6)] /(4π√3)

Candidate 2: 
I = π/√3

To see whether they are numerically the same, evaluate the combination appearing in Candidate 1.

Known (or numerically estimable) trigamma values:
ψ₁(1/3) ≈ 10.0934  
ψ₁(1/6) ≈ 37.338

Compute
7 ψ₁(1/3) – ψ₁(1/6) ≈ 7·10.0934 – 37.338 ≈ 33.32.

Then
[7 ψ₁(1/3) – ψ₁(1/6)] /(4π) ≈ 33.32 /(12.566) ≈ 2.653,  

and
-2π/3 ≈ –2.094.

So the bracketed quantity in Candidate 1 is about 2.653 – 2.094 ≈ 0.559.  
Finally,
I ≈ 0.559 /√3 ≈ 0.322.

Candidate 2, however, gives
I = π/√3 ≈ 1.814.

Because 0.322 and 1.814 differ well beyond the 10⁻⁶ tolerance, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single probability value.  

• Candidate 1’s prediction: 3/4  
• Candidate 2’s prediction: 0  

These are two different numerical values, so they are not equivalent (Rule 4).
The two candidates give different closed-form expressions:

Candidate 1: (π / 2n) · exp[ –a sin(π / 2n) ] · cos[ a cos(π / 2n) ]

Candidate 2: (π e^{–a}) / [ 2n sin(π / 2n) ]

These are clearly not the same function of a and n (different exponential factors, different cosine vs. sine denominator, etc.). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: (π e^{–a}) / [ 2n sin(π / 2n) ]

If n = 1 both give π/2 e^{–a}, but for general n they differ:

• The exponential factors are e^{–a sin(π/2n)} vs e^{–a}. These coincide only when sin(π/2n)=1, i.e. n=1.

• Candidate 1 contains an extra factor cos[a cos(π/2n)], which depends on a and n; Candidate 2 lacks this factor but instead has a division by sin(π/2n).

Because of these mismatches, the two formulas are not the same for general positive integer n.

These two expressions are equal only in the special case where the sum of residues happens to be zero, but in general they are different. Since the problem statement does not impose such a condition, the two candidates are giving different (non-equivalent) answers.

Both answers provide:

1. The same set of linear factors  
   • Candidate 1: ∏_{n=1}^{k} (x − e^{(2n−1)iπ/k})  
   • Candidate 2: ∏_{n=0}^{k−1} (x − e^{iπ(2n+1)/k})  
   (index shift only, same roots).

2. The same antiderivative up to an additive constant.  
   For each root ζ_n = e^{iπ(2n+1)/k}, the correct partial-fraction coefficient is 1/(k ζ_n^{k−1}).  
   • Candidate 1 coefficient: (1/k) ζ_n^{−(k−1)} = 1/(k ζ_n^{k−1}).  
   • Candidate 2 coefficient: 1 / ∏_{m≠n} (ζ_n − ζ_m); but ∏_{m≠n} (ζ_n − ζ_m) = k ζ_n^{k−1}, so this is also 1/(k ζ_n^{k−1}).  

Hence both integrals are identical (log arguments differ only by absolute-value notation, which does not change the antiderivative up to the constant).

Thus the two candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different closed-form expressions.

Candidate 1: i π ln²2 + Li₃(2)  (complex in general; contains an explicit i)

Candidate 2: (3/4) π² ln 2  (purely real)

Because Candidate 1 includes an imaginary term while Candidate 2 is purely real, and there is no standard identity that makes i π ln²2 + Li₃(2) equal to (3/4) π² ln 2, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates differ by the additional term i π ln²(2) in Candidate 1.  
Since ln²(2) ≠ 0, the term i π ln²(2) is not zero, so the two expressions cannot be identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The principal-value integral is real.  
Candidate 1 expresses the result as  
i π ln²2 + Li₃(2), which is generally complex (Li₃(2) itself already has an imaginary part −(π/2) ln²2, so Candidate 1’s total imaginary part is +(π/2) ln²2 i).  

Candidate 2 gives a purely real combination 2 ζ(3) − (π²/6) ln 2 − (ln 2)³/3.

Even after using the known analytic continuation formula  
Li₃(2) = ζ(3) + (π²/6) ln 2 − (ln 2)³/6 − (π/2) i ln²2,  
the expression from Candidate 1 becomes  
[ζ(3) + (π²/6) ln 2 − (ln 2)³/6] + (π/2) i ln²2,  
which is clearly different from Candidate 2’s real value.

Thus the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1’s expression is  
 i π ln²(2) + Li₃(2).  

Candidate 2’s expression is  
 Li₃(2).

The two expressions differ by the non-zero term i π ln²(2).  
Unless that additional term is identically zero (which it is not) or is already included implicitly in the definition of Li₃(2) used by Candidate 2 (the problem statement does not indicate such a convention), the two answers are not the same.

Candidate 2 claims the value is just  

π/16(π²/4 − ln²(√2−1)).  

Because Candidate 1 includes an additional double-integral term that Candidate 2 omits, the two answers give different expressions for the value of the integral. Hence they are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ in the argument of the step (Heaviside) function:

• Candidate 1:  Θ(|ω| − |Δ|)  
• Candidate 2:  θ(|ω| − Δ)

Unless Δ is explicitly restricted to be non-negative, these step functions are not identical (for a negative Δ, θ(|ω| − Δ) is always 1, while Θ(|ω| − |Δ|) imposes the gap condition). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two proposed expressions differ in several essential ways:

1. ℏ-dependence  
   • Candidate 1 has 1/(ℏ² v²).  
   • Candidate 2 has 1/(ℏ v²).  

2. Absolute-value versus signed ω  
   • Candidate 1 uses |ω|, making the expression even in ω.  
   • Candidate 2 uses ω itself, so it is not even and would be negative for ω<0.

3. Domain specification  
   • Candidate 1 employs Θ(|ω|−|Δ|), covering both positive and negative ω outside the gap.  
   • Candidate 2 states a piecewise form only for ω≥Δ and gives 0 otherwise.

Because of these differences, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ substantially:

1. Exponential factor  
   • Candidate 1:  exp[ i(√a+√b)² / T ]  
   • Candidate 2:  exp[ −(a+b)/T ]

   These are not the same function of a and b.

2. Prefactor dependence  
   • Candidate 1 involves (√a+√b)/(√a √b) and √i/T³.  
   • Candidate 2 involves (a+b)^{-3/2}, T^{-3/2}, and no √i factor (aside from an overall i).

Because both the exponential and algebraic prefactors are different, the two candidates are not mathematically equivalent.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different functional forms:

1. Candidate 1 contains an exponential factor  
   exp[i(√a+√b)² / T], which depends on a and b.
   Candidate 2 has no exponential factor at all.

2. The power of T is different:  
   Candidate 1 ∝ T^(–3/2), whereas Candidate 2 ∝ T^(–2).

3. The dependence on a and b (outside the exponential) is also different.

Since they cannot match for generic a and b, the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give

√π · Γ((k + 2)/(2k)) / Γ(1/k)

because

1/k + 1/2 = (2 + k)/(2k).

Since the numerators, denominators, and the √π factor are identical, the two answers are mathematically the same.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions can be rewritten in the same form:

• Candidate 1  
  √π · Γ((k+2)/(2k)) / Γ(1/k)

• Candidate 2  
  Γ(½+1/k) · Γ(½) / Γ(1/k)  
  = √π · Γ(½+1/k) / Γ(1/k)

Since Γ(½) = √π and (k+2)/(2k) = ½ + 1/k, the two candidates are identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give  

Candidate 1: √π · Γ((k + 2)/(2k)) / Γ(1/k)  

Candidate 2: √π · Γ(1/k + 1/2) / Γ(1/k)  

Note that  

(k + 2)/(2k) = k/(2k) + 2/(2k) = 1/2 + 1/k.  

Therefore Γ((k + 2)/(2k)) = Γ(1/k + 1/2).

Since the numerators are identical after this simplification and the denominators are already the same, the two expressions are mathematically identical.

• denominator power of r (r² vs r)

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 describe completely different sets of initial values.

• Candidate 2 says convergence occurs exactly for the interval [ −√2, √2 ].

• Candidate 1 includes many numbers outside that interval (e.g., 2, −2, √3 ≈ 1.732 > √2), so its set is strictly larger than [ −√2, √2 ].

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 asserts that convergence occurs only for a special, essentially countable set of initial values (those expressible by certain finite nested radicals), whereas Candidate 2 asserts convergence for every initial value in the whole interval [−√2, √2]. These two descriptions of the convergence set are completely different, and Candidate 1 gives detailed limits tied to those special values while Candidate 2 merely says the possible limits are 1 and −2 without specifying the correspondence. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

Candidate 1 states that convergence occurs precisely for those initial values that can be written as a *finite* nested radical ending with “… ± √2 ”.  
Candidate 2 describes the admissible initial values as *infinite* nested radicals “±√(2 ± √(2 ± ⋯))”.

A value coming from a finite nest is not, in general, the value of an infinite nest with the same pattern, and an infinite nest can converge to numbers that are not produced by any finite nest. Hence the two candidates are describing different (non-equal) sets of admissible initial values.  
Because the sets are not the same, the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give two different explicit formulas.

• Candidate 2 depends only on z = ξ²/2 (and on 2z inside the Bessel functions), so it is an even function of ξ and does not change when ξ → –ξ.  

Since the original integral is not, in general, an even function of ξ, the two formulas cannot coincide for both positive and negative ξ; moreover, even for ξ > 0 the overall coefficients (π/√2)(z/2)^{1/4}e^{-z}/… versus (1/2)e^{-2z}/… differ. Therefore the two answers are not the same.

  • term₁ = −(15/8) Li₄(½)              ≈ −0.970273  
  • term₂ = −(7/4) ζ(3) ln 2             ≈ −1.459499

  • term₅ = (3/32) π² ln²2             ≈  0.444551  

  Sum of all terms ≈ −0.0289.

Candidate 2 equals −π⁴/360 ≈ −0.270581.

Since −0.0289 ≠ −0.270581 (they differ already in the first significant digit and certainly do not match to six significant digits), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two proposed closed–form expressions are structurally very different.

•  Candidate 1 contains  
  – one exponential–integral term evaluated at 0 ( Ei(0) ) and  
  – a generalized Wright function of type  _1Ψ_0 with parameters (0,c) and argument B/(A−1)^c.

•  Candidate 2 contains  
  – two exponential–integral terms evaluated at –1 and –A, respectively, and  
  – a Wright function W_{−1/c,1} with argument –A/B multiplied by the prefactor B^{−1/c} Γ(1/c).

These special-function terms have different parameter lists and different arguments; there is no standard identity that converts the combination in Candidate 1 into the combination in Candidate 2 (or vice-versa) simply by re-arranging parameters or using elementary identities. Consequently, the two expressions are not the same.

The two candidates give completely different analytic expressions:

1. Candidate 1 contains

2. Candidate 2 contains  
   E₁(1) − E₁(A) − B^{1/c} Γ(1/c) W_{1/c,1}\!\left(−\dfrac{A}{c} B^{−1/c}\right).

Even ignoring the differing generalized-Wright arguments, the exponential-integral parts already differ: −Ei(0) versus E₁(1)−E₁(A)=−Ei(−1)+Ei(−A). Therefore the two results cannot be the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates present very different expressions:

1. Candidate 1 contains the term “−Ei(0)” (a divergent constant) and a generalized Wright function

2. Candidate 2 contains “Ei(1) − Ei(A)” (finite and A–dependent) and a Wright function  
   −(1/c) B^(−1/c) W_{1,1/c}(−A/B^{1/c}).

The exponential-integral parts are not the same (−Ei(0) vs Ei(1)−Ei(A)), and the Wright-function parts have completely different parameters and arguments. No standard identity equates these two forms in general; therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 contains an explicit –(41/360) π⁵ term (and other terms with π log⁴2, π³ log²2, etc.).  
• Candidate 2 contains no π⁵ term at all; its highest power of π is π³.

Because π⁵ cannot be generated or cancelled by the other constants present in Candidate 2 (Li₄(½), ζ(3), π³ log 2, π² log 2), the two expressions cannot be the same. A quick numerical check confirms a mismatch at the 10⁻² level, far beyond the 6-significant-figure tolerance.

Factor sin y out and compare the x-dependent parts:

Candidate 1 ⇒ f₁(x) = 2 a x / (2 − a² x)  
Candidate 2 ⇒ f₂(x) = sinh(a x)

These functions of x are not the same.  
For example, take a = 1 and x = 0.1:

f₁(0.1) = 0.2 / 1.9 ≈ 0.105263  
f₂(0.1) = sinh(0.1) ≈ 0.100167

Comparing the x-dependent factors:

f₁(x) = 2 a x / (2 – a²x)
f₂(x) = sinh(a x) = (e^{ax} – e^{-ax})/2

These functions are not the same. A quick series expansion confirms the mismatch:

f₁(x) = a x + (a³x²)/2 + (a⁵x³)/4 + …
f₂(x) = a x + (a³x³)/6 + (a⁵x⁵)/120 + …

Therefore

  (2/m) ∑_{k=1}^{m} (H_k/k) = (H_m² + ∑_{k=1}^{m} 1/k²)/m.

Hence Candidate 1’s formula is algebraically identical to Candidate 2’s formula for every positive integer m. They are the same answer.

The two candidates give completely different closed‐form expressions.

• Candidate 1 contains terms with ln 2, Li₄(½), πζ(3)ln 2, π³ln²2, πln⁴2, and π⁵.

• Candidate 2 involves only ζ(3), π², and rational numbers; it has no ln 2, no Li₄(½), and no higher powers of π.

Because the structures of the expressions differ and candidate 1 includes transcendental parts absent from candidate 2, the two answers cannot be identical.

Candidate 2: π⁴/90.

Even a rough numerical evaluation of candidate 1 (~1.21–1.23) does not match π⁴/90 (~1.08232); moreover, candidate 1 contains extra constants (ζ(3), Li₄, ln 2, etc.) that cannot cancel to leave just π⁴/90 without a non-trivial identity that is not evident here. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not algebraically the same.

  = (1/4)·(24 m² + 2)/m² = 3/2 + 1/(8m²).  

• Candidate 2 ⇒ (4m/[(4m²−1)π])¹ = 4m/[(4m²−1)π], which clearly does not equal 3/2 + 1/(8m²) for general m.

Since they differ already for simple choices of m and k, the two candidates are inequivalent.

Testing (for example with k = 1) shows they are not equal:  
Candidate 1 gives (6m + 0.5/m)/( (4m^2-1)π ), while Candidate 2 gives 4m/((4m^2-1)π).

The integral’s value must be dimensionless (all arguments of the digamma are already dimensionless).  

• Candidate 1:  Re Ψ(½ + ħω⁄(2π i k_B T)) − ln(ħω⁄k_B T) → dimensionless.  

• Candidate 2:  −(1/(2π ω)) Re[ψ(1+ħω/(2k_B T))−ψ(1−ħω/(2k_B T))] → prefactor 1/ω introduces a factor with dimension 1/frequency, so the whole expression is not dimensionless.

For l = 2 (the first non-trivial even value):

• Candidate 2 gives R^{2+1}·2²·(1!)²/3! = R³·(4/6) = (2/3)R³.

The two answers express completely different closed-form formulas:

Candidate 2: (π / sin(π a)) ⋅ Γ(1−2a) / (2 b^{(a+1)/2})

The functional structures, the special-function factors, and the parameter dependences are all different; no straightforward identity makes them the same expression. Simple test values (e.g., a = 1/2) already show they give incompatible results (Candidate 2 diverges, whereas the integral is finite). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates present completely different closed-form expressions, and a quick check at a simple parameter value (e.g. a = 1) shows that Candidate 2 does not even reproduce the known elementary result ∫₀^∞ t e^{-b t²} dt = 1/(2b). Hence the two expressions cannot be equal to each other. They are not equivalent. 

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give completely different closed-form expressions for the same integral:

• Candidate 1:  (2^{a-3}) / (π Γ(a-1)) multiplied by a Meijer-G function  
• Candidate 2:  Γ((a+1)/2) / [2 b^{(a+1)/2}]

These expressions are not obviously the same function of a and b.  Testing specific values shows they differ:

‒ For a = 0 (just outside the open interval but approaching 0⁺), the integral equals ½√(π/b) + 1/(2b), whereas Candidate 2 gives only ½√(π/b).  
‒ For a = 1 the two formulas do not even have the same analytical behaviour: Candidate 1 contains the factor 1/Γ(a−1) which blows up, while Candidate 2 remains finite.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The answer requires a list of two values.

Candidate 1 supplies [0.333, 0.25].  
Candidate 2 supplies [1/3, 1/4].

Compare term-by-term to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

1. First entry:  
   Candidate 1 → 0.333000  
   Candidate 2 → 1/3 ≈ 0.333333  
   These differ at the 4th decimal place, so they are not equal to 6 significant digits.

2. Second entry:  
   Candidate 1 → 0.250000  
   Candidate 2 → 1/4 = 0.25 → 0.250000  
   These match, but equivalence of the whole list fails because the first entries differ.

Since at least one corresponding element differs, the two lists are not identical; therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The lists each contain two numerical answers in the same order, so we compare element-by-element (Rule 3).

First component  
• Candidate 1: 0.333 → 0.333000 (to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 1/3  ≈  0.333333 (to 6 significant digits)  

Since 0.333000 ≠ 0.333333, they do not match to six significant digits (Rule 4).

Because at least one corresponding entry differs, the two lists are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the list [0.333, 0.25]; candidate 2 gives [1/3, 1/4].

• Compare first entries:

  – Candidate 1’s 0.333 extended to six significant digits is 0.333000.  
  At the 4-th significant digit they differ (0 vs 3), so by Rule 4 they are not equal to six-digit precision.

• Second entries: 0.25 equals 1/4 exactly, so these match.

Because at least one corresponding element differs, the two lists are not identical, hence the answers are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 3).

Candidate 1 gives a single number: “163”.

Candidate 2 gives two numbers: “2 163.0”, which supplies both a multiplicity (2) and the value 163.0.

The problem requests the multiplicity of the root and the value of P′(2)+P″(2). Thus two answers are required. Candidate 1 provides only one answer, while Candidate 2 provides both. Therefore, the two responses are not equivalent.

Both answers represent the same numerical value.

• Candidate 1: 7.77778

The two answers represent numerical values for dy/dt.

Candidate 1: 1.667 (no explicit unit, implicitly m/s)  
Candidate 2: 5/3 m/s = 1.666666… m/s

Express both to six significant digits:  
Candidate 1 → 1.66700  
Candidate 2 → 1.66667

Since the digits differ at the fourth significant figure, the two values are not identical to six significant digits, so the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 3 × 10⁻³⁶ (kg m/s implied), while Candidate 2 gives 1.5065 × 10⁻³⁶ kg m/s. Numerically, 3.00000 × 10⁻³⁶ ≠ 1.50650 × 10⁻³⁶; they differ by roughly a factor of 2. Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

The question calls for a single numerical answer (the index of refraction of water).  

Candidate 1 gives 2.37.  
Candidate 2 gives 1.10.  

The two numerical results differ, and hence they are not the same to six significant digits (or at all). Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value for the limit:

Candidate 1 gives: 362 880  
Candidate 2 gives: 333 424 922  

Both answers are single integer counts, so the same unit is used (Rule 1).  
Comparing the two numerical results to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• 362 880 → 3.62880 × 10⁵ (significant digits: 362880)  
• 333 424 922 → 3.33425 × 10⁸ (significant digits: 333425 after rounding)

They are clearly different numbers.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different numerical answers:

• Candidate 1: 362880  
• Candidate 2: 3628800

These numbers differ by a factor of 10, so they are not the same value (even when compared to six significant digits).

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 28.3.  
The question explicitly asks for the binding energy “in MeV,” so the only sensible unit here is MeV; Candidate 1’s omission of the unit therefore does not create real ambiguity.  
Thus, the two answers represent the same quantity.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a single numerical value (binding energy) in MeV.  

Candidate 1: 28.3 (no unit explicitly written)  
Candidate 2: 28.296 MeV

1. Units: Candidate 2 explicitly states MeV, Candidate 1 omits the unit but the question specifies MeV. Even if we assume Candidate 1 intends MeV, continue with numeric comparison.  
2. Numeric value comparison (Rule 4):  
   • Candidate 1 → 28.3000 (to six significant digits)  
   • Candidate 2 → 28.2960 (to six significant digits)  
   These differ at the third decimal place, so they are not identical to 6 significant digits.

Therefore, according to the guidelines, the two answers are NOT equivalent.

The question asks for one numerical answer in meters.

Candidate 1 provides: 5.65 (implicit meters)  
Candidate 2 provides: 5.725 m

Both are single real numbers with the same unit (meters).  
Compare to six significant digits:

Candidate 1 → 5.65000  
Candidate 2 → 5.72500

The values differ already at the second decimal place, so they are not equal per Rule 4.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both answers give the same numerical value 5.65, and the problem explicitly specifies the unit “m”, so candidate 1’s omission of the unit is not ambiguous. Therefore the two predictions are equivalent.

The question requires two numerical answers:

(a) Intensity in W/cm²  
(b) Photon flux in photons/cm²/s

Candidate 1 gives:
(a) 3.00 × 10⁻⁶ W/cm²  
(b) 7.5 × 10¹² photons/cm²/s  

Candidate 2 gives:
(a) 8.33 × 10⁻⁸ W/cm²  
(b) 2.31 × 10¹¹ photons/cm²/s  

For each sub-answer, compare to six significant digits (Rule 4):

(a) 3.00000 × 10⁻⁶ vs 8.33000 × 10⁻⁸ → differ by a factor ≈ 36.  
(b) 7.50000 × 10¹² vs 2.31000 × 10¹¹ → differ by a factor ≈ 32.  

Both sub-answers differ significantly; therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives 10 % (0.10) and 80 % (0.80).

For each of the seven spectral regions the two candidates give opposite or different claims (e.g. for region (a) C1 says “strongly absorbed” while C2 says “transparent”, and there are further mismatches for (c), (f), (g), etc.). Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two overall answers are not equivalent under Rule 2.
Both candidates select the same option text “8 min”, and Candidate 2 explicitly labels it as choice “(b)”. This corresponds to the identical multiple-choice answer. Hence, according to Rule 5, the two predictions are equivalent.

The question asks for two numerical answers:  

1. distance from the object to the objective (in cm)  
2. magnifying power (unit-less)

Candidate 1:  
• 0.51 cm  
• 290  

Candidate 2:  
• 0.51 cm  
• –500  

Although the first values match, the magnifying powers (290 vs –500) differ in both magnitude and sign. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Reflectivity: both give 0.376, which matches.  
• Thickness: Candidate 1 states 0.055 μm; Candidate 2 states 0.05 μm. Converting units (both already in μm), the values differ (0.055000 vs 0.050000). They are not identical to six significant digits, so Rule 4 indicates inequivalence.  

Therefore the two candidates’ full answer sets are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different expressions for the distance:

Candidate 2: (3.8317 / 2π) · (λ L / R)

• Candidate 1 is proportional to R²/λ, while Candidate 2 is proportional to λ L/R and even contains an extra variable L that does not appear in Candidate 1.  
• Because the functional dependence on R and λ (and the presence of an additional symbol L) are different, the two answers cannot be equivalent.

Candidate 1: 4260 Å  
Candidate 2: 4.26 × 10⁻⁷ m  

1 Å = 10⁻¹⁰ m → 4260 Å = 4260 × 10⁻¹⁰ m = 4.260 × 10⁻⁷ m.  
Expressed to six significant digits: 4.26000 × 10⁻⁷ m.

Candidate 2 already gives 4.26 × 10⁻⁷ m, which is 4.26000 × 10⁻⁷ m to six significant digits.

Thus, both candidates represent the same numerical value and unit after conversion.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both predictions represent the same numerical value expressed in different units:

• Candidate 1: 4260 Å  
  1 Å = 1 × 10⁻¹⁰ m → 4260 Å = 4260 × 10⁻¹⁰ m = 4.26 × 10⁻⁷ m

• Candidate 2: 4.26 × 10⁻⁷ m

Candidate 1 gives

I = A₀² [ sin²( (n a sinθ)/λ ) / ( (n a sinθ)/λ )² ] × [ sin²( 3 n d sinθ / λ ) / sin²( n d sinθ / λ ) ] ,

i.e. a product of a single-slit diffraction envelope (depends on slit width a) and the three-slit interference factor.

Candidate 2 gives

I = I₀ [ sin(3π d sinθ / λ) / sin(π d sinθ / λ) ]² ,

which contains only the three-slit interference factor and no term involving the slit width a.

Because the two expressions are not identical and cannot, in general, be converted into each other without assuming an additional limiting case (a → 0), the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different analytical expressions.

1. General expression  
   • Candidate 1: a² (sin u/u)² + b² (sin v/v)² + 2ab (sin u/u)(sin v/v) cos w  
   • Candidate 2: I₀[ (sin πa sinθ / πa sinθ)² + (sin πb sinθ / πb sinθ)² + 2( … ) cos(2πc sinθ/λ) ]

   Candidate 1 has the factors a² and b² outside the squared sinc-terms, whereas Candidate 2’s sinc denominators contain a and b, so there is no overall a² or b² multiplier.  A global constant I₀ cannot simultaneously reproduce those different a- and b-dependences, so the formulas are not the same.

2. Special cases produce analogous discrepancies (a=b term contains a² vs I₀, etc.).

Because their formulas differ in their functional dependence on the slit widths, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Reasoning:
1. The problem asks for two answers: (a) name/description of the phenomenon and (b) an expression for φ. Candidate 1 supplies both, while Candidate 2 gives only the expression, omitting part (a). According to Rule 2, omission of any required sub-answer makes the candidates inequivalent.
2. Even focusing only on part (b), the formulas differ: Candidate 1 has φ = (ω d / 2c)(n_R − n_L), whereas Candidate 2 has φ = (π ω d / c)(n_R − n_L). The factors 1/2 and π are not equal, so the expressions are not the same.

Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives wavelengths 4000 Å, 5000 Å, 6670 Å.  
Converting to nanometers (1 Å = 0.1 nm) → 400 nm, 500 nm, 667 nm.

Candidate 2 gives 400 nm, 500 nm, 666 nm.

Comparing each value to 6 significant digits:

• 400 nm vs 400 nm → identical.  
• 500 nm vs 500 nm → identical.  
• 667 nm vs 666 nm → differ (667.000 vs 666.000).

Since at least one wavelength is not the same, the two answer sets are not identical.  
Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Both candidates give three wavelength/color pairs, but the third wavelength differs:

• Candidate 1: 667 nm (from 6670 Å)  
• Candidate 2: 666 nm

Converting units, we compare 667 nm to 666 nm. Rule 4 requires equality to 6 significant digits; 667.000 ≠ 666.000. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates supply answers for both required sub-parts (charge and energy). 

Charge:
• Candidate 1: 7 × 10⁻¹¹ C  
• Candidate 2: 7 × 10⁻¹¹ C  
→ Identical.

Energy:
• Candidate 1: 2.5 × 10⁻¹² J  
• Candidate 2: 2.45 × 10⁻¹² J  

Expressed to six significant digits these are 2.50000 × 10⁻¹² J and 2.45000 × 10⁻¹² J, which differ already at the second digit. Therefore, per Rule 4, the energy answers are not the same.

The question asks for 4 Fresnel-coefficient formulas (rₛ, tₛ, rₚ, tₚ) plus Brewster’s law.  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different algebraic expressions for several of those items:

1. rₚ  
   • Candidate 1:  rₚ = tan(θ₂ − θ₁) / tan(θ₂ + θ₁)  
   • Candidate 2:  rₚ = (n₂ cosθ₁ − n₁ cosθ₂) / (n₂ cosθ₁ + n₁ cosθ₂)  
   These differ in sign (they are not algebraically equivalent).

2. tₛ  
   • Candidate 1:  tₛ = 2 sinθ₂ cosθ₁ / sin(θ₂ + θ₁)  
   • Candidate 2:  tₛ = 2 n₁ cosθ₁ / [n₂(n₁ cosθ₁ + n₂ cosθ₂)]  
   Candidate 2 has an extra factor n₂ in the denominator; the two formulas are not equivalent.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two entire predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates give the same numerical factor 27/128.  
Candidate 1 multiplies this factor by I₀ (explicitly giving the transmitted intensity), while Candidate 2 states just the fraction (implicitly the same factor of the incident intensity). Multiplying Candidate 2’s result by I₀ yields exactly Candidate 1’s expression. Hence, after unit conversion, the two answers coincide.

The problem asks for several distinct items:

(a)  
   1. The formula for I(θ)  
   2. Whether that formula depends on the un-polarised fraction  

(b)  
   3. The new maximum intensity  
   4. The un-polarised fraction

Comparison:

1. Formula for I(θ):  
   • C1: I = 1.5 I₀ cos²θ + I₀ sin²θ → simplifies to I₀(1 + 0.5 cos²θ).  
   • C2: I = I₀(1 + 0.5 cos²θ).  
   ⇒ Equivalent.

2. Dependence on un-polarised fraction:  
   • C1 gives no explicit answer.  
   • C2 answers “No”.  
   ⇒ Not equivalent (C1 is incomplete).

3. Maximum intensity after plate + analyser:  
   • C1: 1.75 I₀  
   • C2: 1.5 I₀  
   ⇒ Different.

4. Un-polarised fraction:  
   • C1: 0.60  
   • C2: 0.80  
   ⇒ Different.

Since at least one required sub-answer differs or is missing, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question has three sub-parts and each requires a single angular result.  
Candidate 1 supplies “± arcsin(…)” for every part, i.e. two symmetric angles.  
Candidate 2 supplies only “arcsin(…)”, i.e. just the positive angle.

Because Candidate 2 omits the negative solutions that Candidate 1 includes, the individual answers are not identical.  
Under Rule 2, any discrepancy in the corresponding sub-answers means the two submissions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give two wavelengths, but one of the values differs:

• First wavelength: 6000 Å vs 6000 Å → identical.

• Second wavelength: 4285 Å (interpreted as 4285.00 Å) vs 4285.71 Å.  
  Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4): 4285.00 differs from 4285.71, so they are not the same number.

Since at least one of the individual answers differs, the overall answer sets are not identical (Rule 3). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
The question asks for the wavelengths (plural) in the visible spectrum that give maximum reflected intensity, so each candidate must list the complete set of wavelengths.

• Both candidates list two wavelengths.
• Both give 6000 Å as one wavelength.
• For the other wavelength, Candidate 1 gives 4285 Å while Candidate 2 gives 4285.71 Å.

Applying Rule 4 (compare numerical answers to 6 significant digits):
– Candidate 1’s 4285 Å = 4285.00 (to 6 sig. figs.).
– Candidate 2’s value is 4285.71 Å.

4285.00 ≠ 4285.71 when expressed to 6 significant digits, so the two answers are different.  
Since at least one of the required wavelengths does not match, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.

To answer, compare each listed wavelength.

1. First wavelength:  
   • Candidate 1: 6000 Å  
   • Candidate 2: 6000 Å  
   → Identical.

2. Second wavelength:  
   • Candidate 1: 4285 Å (which is 4285.00 Å to six significant digits)  
   • Candidate 2: 4285.71 Å  
   → Differ at the 5th–6th significant digits (4285.00 vs 4285.71).

Rule 4 requires equality up to six significant digits. Since the second numbers are not identical to six-digit precision, the two answer sets are not equivalent.

The problem asks for three separate numerical answers (self-inductance L, mutual inductance M, and charge q).  
Both candidates supply three answers, so each sub-answer must be compared.

1. Self-inductance  
   • Candidate 1: 2.513 × 10⁻⁴ H  
   • Candidate 2: 8π × 10⁻⁵ H = 25.1327 × 10⁻⁵ H = 2.51327 × 10⁻⁴ H  
   Comparing to six significant digits: 2.51300 vs 2.51327 → differ at the 5th digit ⇒ not equal.

2. Mutual inductance  
   • Candidate 1: 2.513 × 10⁻⁵ H  
   • Candidate 2: 8π × 10⁻⁶ H = 2.51327 × 10⁻⁵ H  
   Again differ at the 5th significant digit ⇒ not equal.

3. Charge  
   • Candidate 1: 2.76 × 10⁻⁷ C  
   • Candidate 2: 8π × 10⁻⁹ C = 2.51327 × 10⁻⁸ C  
   Exponents differ (10⁻⁷ vs 10⁻⁸) ⇒ clearly not equal.

Since at least one sub-answer (in fact all three) differs, the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The problem has four sub-parts.  
For each sub-answer the two candidates must match (units, numerical factors, signs, γ-dependence, etc.).

Comparison:

(a) Candidate 1:  −eρ₀r/(2ε₀) e_r  Candidate 2:  +eρ₀r/(2ε₀)  
 Sign difference → not identical.

(b) Candidate 1:  −eρr/(2ε₀γ²) e_r  Candidate 2:  +eρr/(2ε₀)  
 Different sign and an extra γ² factor → not identical.

(c) Although both say “γ times larger” when changing frames, their explicit forces differ because their lab-frame forces differ. → not identical.

(d) Candidate 1: 1.21 Gauss / cm = 0.0121 T/m  
 Candidate 2: 0.61 T/m  
 Numerically different by ~50× → not identical.

Since at least one sub-answer in each part differs, by Rule 2 the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and candidate 2 give completely different formulas.  
• Candidate 1 contains the factors ε₀, √(2 e /m), V₀^(3/2), and d⁻² (Child–Langmuir form).  
• Candidate 2 is simply e V₀ / d, lacking ε₀, the mass factor, the 3/2 voltage power, and the d⁻² dependence.

They are not the same expression, nor can they be made equal by any simple unit conversion.

• Candidate 2: J = e V₀/d  ∝ V₀/d

They differ in functional dependence on V₀ and d, contain different constants (ε₀, m appear only in Candidate 1), and even the sign/direction information differs. Hence they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the potential as a sum of the field of the real charge plus an image charge, but they place that image charge at different positions:

• Candidate 1 uses the image point  
 s′ = (a²/|s|) s  (magnitude a², same direction as s).

• Candidate 2 uses the image point  
 s′ = −(a²/|s|²) s  (magnitude a²/|s|, opposite direction to s).

Because the locations of the image charges differ, the two potentials are not the same functions. Therefore the answers are not equivalent for either sub-problem (a) or (b).

Candidate 1 supplies two distinct vector expressions, one for the interior field and one for the exterior, with the exterior field containing the additional dipole‐like term expected for a polarized sphere.

Candidate 2 gives the same interior field but states that the exterior field equals the original uniform field E₀, omitting the dipole correction.

Because the exterior fields are different, the two candidates do not give identical complete answers to the multi-part question (Rule 2).

The problem has two sub-parts:

(a) requires writing the conservation equations.  
To be complete, one needs the energy equation plus the momentum equations in (at least) two independent directions (or a full vector equation).

• Candidate 1 supplies:
  – x-component of momentum  
  – y-component of momentum  
  – energy equation  

Hence all required relations are listed.

• Candidate 2 supplies:
  – only one (x-component) momentum equation  
  – energy equation  

The second independent momentum equation is missing, so Candidate 2 gives fewer answers than required.

(b) Both candidates give the same algebraic result for the back-scattered photon energy, but Rule 2 states that if any required part is missing in one answer while present in the other, the two answers are not equivalent.

Therefore the two candidates’ sets of answers are not equivalent.

The problem asks for three specific numerical results:  
1. Power required (W)  
2. Weight of copper (kg)  
3. Force between poles (N)

Candidate 1 gives  
• Power = 9.5 × 10⁴ W (95 000 W)  
• Weight = 3.8 kg  
• Force = 8 × 10⁵ N (800 000 N)

Candidate 2 gives  
• 254.72 kg (weight)  
• 636.8 W (power)  
• 796 000 N (force)

Comparing each required quantity:

1. Power: 95 000 W vs 636.8 W → different  
2. Weight: 3.8 kg vs 254.72 kg → different  
3. Force: 800 000 N vs 796 000 N → different (not identical to 6 significant digits)

Thus none of the three answers match. The two candidates are not equivalent.

whereas Candidate 2 gives  

 x = (c² / g) · (γ − 1).

Because γ − 1 ≠ γ, the two answers differ by the additive term (c² / g). Hence they are inequivalent.

The two expressions for B differ in their denominators: 

• Candidate 1: 2 π R + (μ_r – 1) s  
• Candidate 2: 2 π R

Since s is not specified to be zero and μ_r is not necessarily 1, these denominators are generally unequal, giving different numerical results for B. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both sub-problems require explicit answers.

Part (a)
• Candidate 1 gives component reflection formulas; Candidate 2 states only “elliptically polarized.”  They are clearly different answers.

Part (b)
• Candidate 1 supplies incomplete symbolic expressions (“coefficients determined by solving the system”); Candidate 2 supplies definite transmission factors.  The expressions are not identical and not obviously algebraically equivalent.

Since at least one answer to each part disagrees or is incomplete, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2, Rule 6, Rule 8).

• Candidate 2: “(b) 6 × 10⁻³ Tesla”

Both indicate the magnetic field is 6 × 10⁻³ T, which corresponds to option (b). Hence they are equivalent.

The two sets of answers differ in the last sub-problem:

Sub-problem (d) – direction of the magnetic field  
• Candidate 1: “z” (sign not specified; could be +z or –z, ambiguous)  
• Candidate 2: “+z” (explicitly the positive z-direction)

Because the sign of the direction is part of the required information and Candidate 1 leaves it ambiguous while Candidate 2 specifies it, their answers are not identical. According to the rules, this ambiguity makes the two candidates inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same numerical values for  
(a) frequency (10⁸ Hz),  
(b) wavelength (3 m), and  
(c) propagation direction (positive x).

For part (d) they differ:

• Candidate 1: “direction of magnetic field: z” (no sign specified; ambiguous between +z and –z).  
• Candidate 2: “Positive z-direction” (explicitly +z).

Since one answer is ambiguous while the other is explicit, the two candidates are not fully identical for every required sub-answer, so they are not equivalent.

The two candidates do not give identical answers for every sub-part:

(a)  Candidate 1 never states the system of units (required by the question), whereas Candidate 2 explicitly says “SI units.”  
(c)  Under space inversion, Candidate 1 keeps B unchanged, Candidate 2 reverses B → –B.  
(d)  Under time reversal, Candidate 1 keeps E unchanged, Candidate 2 reverses E → –E.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).
Both candidates provide the identical expression for the x-component of the field:

− i y d l / (x² + y² + z²)³ᐟ²

Candidate 2 merely prefixes it with “(b)” to indicate the multiple-choice option, but the substantive answer is the same expression. Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

The question asks for the electric field E, which is a vector quantity, and for the potential φ (a scalar).

Sub-part (a):  
• Candidate 1: E = (ρ / 3ε₀) 𝒂 (a vector expression).  
• Candidate 2: E = (ρ a)/(3ε₀) (only a scalar magnitude, no direction specified).

Because Candidate 2 omits the vector direction, the two answers for part (a) are not identical. Even though their magnitudes match, one answer is vectorial while the other is scalar.

Sub-part (b): The two potentials are algebraically identical, but equivalence requires every requested component to match.

Since the answers for part (a) are not fully the same, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a force proportional to Q q r (ion charge Q times the beam’s linear charge density q).

Candidate 2 gives a force proportional to q² r (square of the beam’s linear charge density).

Since Q (charge of one ion, in coulombs) is dimensionally and numerically different from q (charge per unit length, in C m⁻¹), the two expressions differ by a factor of q / Q and therefore are not the same.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both sub-parts (a) and (b) are required.

• Part (a):  
 – Candidate 1 gives no explicit expression for the electric field (just a reference).  
 – Candidate 2 supplies explicit inside and outside fields.  
 → Already not the same.

• Part (b):  
 Even the potentials given differ for r < R. (ρ/6ε₀)(3 R² – r²) is the standard form, but Candidate 1 has an extra factor R, while Candidate 2 gives (ρ/6ε₀)(r²+R²). They are not identical.

Since Candidate 1 omits a required answer and the overlapping answers disagree, the two candidates are not equivalent.

     = (q²)/(8 π ε₀) · [t / (R(R+t))]

Candidate 2: k q² / (R+t) = (q²)/(4 π ε₀ (R+t))

For equality we would need  
 t / [8 R (R+t)] = 1 / [4 (R+t)]  ⇒ t = 2 R,

For general R and t these are not equal (different factors of 1/R and t/2). They coincide only for the special case t = 2R, but the question does not impose that condition. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions differ in their algebraic forms.

Candidate 1: W₁ = (1 – K) q² / [16 π (1 + K) ε₀ x]

Candidate 2: W₂ = – q² / [8 π K ε₀ x]

For W₁ to equal W₂ for all K, we would need

(1 – K)/(16 (1 + K)) = –1/(8 K),

which is not an identity; it is satisfied only for the specific roots of K² – 3K – 2 = 0, not for general K. Therefore the two results are not generally the same.

Hence, the candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives 
W₁ = (1 − K) q² / [16 π (1 + K) ε₀ x]

Candidate 2 gives 
W₂ = q² / [8 π K ε₀ x]

Taking the ratio:

W₁ / W₂ = [(1 − K)/(1 + K)] · (K/2)

For the two expressions to be identical this ratio must equal 1, which would require

K(1 − K)/(2(1 + K)) = 1  →  K² + K + 2 = 0,

which has no real positive solutions. Hence, for any physical (positive real) dielectric constant K, the two expressions differ.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates present a single answer for the required force, so Rule 2 is satisfied, and we can compare their expressions directly.

Candidate 1:  − q² /( 4 ε₁ a²)

Candidate 2:   q² /( 16 π ε₁ a²)  ẑ

Key differences:
1. Candidate 1 omits the factor 1/π that appears in Candidate 2 (magnitude differs by 4π).
2. Candidate 1 gives a negative scalar (implicitly along −ẑ); Candidate 2 gives a positive vector along +ẑ.
3. The overall magnitudes are therefore not the same, nor are the directions.

Because the two expressions differ both in magnitude and direction, they are not equivalent.

The two expressions are different.

Candidate 1: t = m² c³ a₀³ / (4 e⁴)

Candidate 2: t = 4 π² ε₀² m² c³ a₀³ / e⁴

Relative factor = 16 π² ε₀², so they are not the same.
The two candidates give different algebraic expressions.

Candidate 1: T₁ = m² c³ a₀³ / (4 e⁴)

Candidate 2: T₂ = 4 π² ε₀² m² c³ a₀³ / e⁴

Even if one tries to interpret Candidate 1 in Gaussian (cgs) units and Candidate 2 in SI units, the factors do not match; converting between systems shows an extra factor of 16 π² ε₀² remains. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not the same.

• Candidate 1: F₁ = e² n r / (2 π ε₀ γ²) e_r  
• Candidate 2: F₂ = n e² r / 2 (1/ε₀ – μ₀ v²)

Using c² = 1/(μ₀ ε₀) and γ² = 1/(1 – v²/c²),

1/ε₀ – μ₀ v² = 1/ε₀ – (v²/c²)/ε₀ = (1 – v²/c²)/ε₀ = 1/(γ² ε₀).

So F₂ = n e² r / [2 ε₀ γ²].

Hence F₁ = n e² r / [2 π ε₀ γ²] whereas F₂ = n e² r / [2 ε₀ γ²].

They differ by a factor of π, so they are not equivalent.
The two answers give different formulas.

Candidate 1: F = (e² n r)/(2 π ε₀ γ²)

Candidate 2: F = (e² n r)/(2 ε₀) + (μ₀ n e² v² r)/2
                = (e² n r)/(2 ε₀) [1 + v²/c²]

Comparing:
1. Candidate 1 has a factor 1/(π) and 1/γ² = (1 − v²/c²).
2. Candidate 2 lacks the π, and its velocity-dependent factor is (1 + v²/c²).

Because the numerical factors and velocity dependence differ, the two expressions are not the same. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives  

F₁ = e² n r /(2 π ε₀ γ²)  e_r

Candidate 2 gives  

F₂ = e² n r /2 (1/ε₀ – μ₀ v²)  
      = e² n r /2 · (1/ε₀)(1 – v²/c²)  
      = e² n r /(2 ε₀ γ²)

Comparing F₁ and F₂, F₁ has an extra factor 1/π.  
Therefore the two results are not the same.

The question asks for three separate results.  
Both candidates provide answers for all three parts, so we compare each part.

Part (a) Force on +q  
• Candidate 1: scalar magnitude F = [(√2 – 1) q²]/[32 π ε₀ a²]; no direction given.  
• Candidate 2: vector F = [k q² (√2 – 4)]/(16 a²) ( î + ẑ ), where k = 1/(4 π ε₀).

Converting Candidate 1’s coefficient to k-notation:  
[(√2 – 1)]/[32 π ε₀] = (√2 – 1) k/8.  
Numerically this is positive (≈0.0518 k).  

Candidate 2’s coefficient is (√2 – 4)/16 ≈ –2.586/16 ≈ –0.1616 k and the answer is a vector with specific direction.  
Clearly the two forces differ in magnitude, sign, and vector character, so part (a) is not the same.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, by Rule 2 the overall answers are not equivalent.

The problem requests three separate results: 
(a) the total force on +q (a vector),  
(b) the work (a scalar energy),  
(c) the surface-charge density σ (a scalar).  

Comparison of each sub-answer:

1. Force   
• Candidate 1: gives only a scalar magnitude, \(F = \frac{(\sqrt{2}-1)q^{2}}{32\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}\) — no direction.  
• Candidate 2: gives a vector, \( \mathbf F = \frac{kq^{2}}{8a^{2}}\!\bigl(-2+\frac{1}{\sqrt2}\bigr)(\hat x+\hat z)\).  
These are clearly not the same object (scalar vs. vector) and the numerical factors differ.

2. Work  
• Candidate 1: \(W = \frac{(\sqrt{2}-1)q^{2}}{16\pi\varepsilon_{0}a}\).  
• Candidate 2: \(U = -\frac{3kq^{2}}{2a}+\frac{kq^{2}}{4a^{2}}\).  
Different forms and even different dimensions (second term in Candidate 2 has 1/a²), so not equivalent.

3. Surface charge density  
• Candidate 1: \(\sigma = \frac{q}{2\pi\varepsilon_{0}a^{2}}\left(\frac1{5\sqrt5}-1\right)\).  
• Candidate 2: \(\sigma = -\frac{2\varepsilon_{0}kq}{a^{2}} = -\frac{q}{2\pi a^{2}}\).  
Factors and presence/absence of \(\varepsilon_{0}\) differ, hence not equivalent.

Since none of the three sub-answers match, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not the same.

Let ε denote the dielectric constant used in the problem.

Candidate 1: C′ = (ε + ε₀)/(2 ε₀) · C  
       = ((ε/ε₀) + 1)/2 · C  (if we set κ = ε/ε₀)

Candidate 2: C′ = 2 ε C / (ε + 1)

If ε is interpreted as the relative permittivity κ, these become

Candidate 1 → C′ = (κ + 1)/2 · C  
Candidate 2 → C′ = 2 κ/(κ + 1) · C

These two fractions are equal only when κ = 1 (trivial vacuum case); otherwise they differ.  
If ε is instead the absolute permittivity, Candidate 2 is dimensionally inconsistent (ε mixes with the unit-less “1”), so the answers cannot match.

Hence, the two candidates are inequivalent.

The two expressions differ by factors of \(R\) in every term (Candidate 2 lacks the explicit \(R\) powers that appear in Candidate 1). Since these factors cannot be ignored without explicitly setting \(R=1\) (which the problem does not state), the two answers give different numerical results for general \(R\). Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give two required sub-answers: K(r) and E(r).

1. K(r):  
   • Candidate 1: K(r) = k r⁻²  
   • Candidate 2: K(r) = C r⁻²  
   These are the same functional dependence (1/r²) up to an arbitrary constant, so they match.

2. E(r):  
   • Candidate 1: E(r) = − 2 V r / (b² − a²)  
   • Candidate 2: E(r) = + 2 V r / (b² − a²)

The two expressions differ by an overall sign. Since the question asks for the electric field, the sign (direction) is physically significant unless explicitly stated that only the magnitude is required. Therefore the E(r) answers are not identical.

Because one of the sub-answers is different, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give two required items: K(r) and E(r).  

• For K(r) they both supply the same functional form (∝ 1/r² with an arbitrary constant), so they match.  
• For E(r) they differ by an overall minus sign:  
 Candidate 1: ‑2 V r /(b² – a²)  
 Candidate 2:  +2 V r /(b² – a²)

Because the electric-field direction (sign) is part of what is asked for, this discrepancy means the answers are not identical.  
Under Rule 2, if any sub-answer differs, the overall answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem asks for two separate results:  

1. the radial dependence K(r), and  
2. the electric-field E(r).

Both candidates supply both pieces, so we compare each part.

• K(r):  
  – Candidate 1: K(r) = k r⁻²  
  – Candidate 2: K(r) = C r⁻²  
  Both have the same r-dependence (∝ 1/r²); the different symbols k vs C are just unspecified constants, so these are equivalent.

• E(r):  
  – Candidate 1: E(r) = − 2 V r / (b² − a²)  
  – Candidate 2: E(r) = + 2 V r / (b² − a²)  
  The two expressions differ by an overall minus sign. This is not merely a difference of units or notation; it represents opposite direction for the field. Because the question asks explicitly for E(r), the sign is part of the answer, so the two candidates do not agree.

Since at least one required sub-answer (E(r)) is different, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for several specific vector fields, the induced field, the torque, the total angular momentum, and an explanation of its origin.  

1. Part (a):  
   • Candidate 1’s magnetic field inside is (2/3) μ₀ M; outside it gives the full dipole‐field angular dependence.  
   • Candidate 2 gives (μ₀/2) M inside and an outside field lacking the angular dependence ([μ₀ M R³/(3 r³)] ẑ).  
   These are not the same.

2. Part (b):  
   • Induced electric field in Candidate 1 has the sin θ angular factor and different radial dependence than Candidate 2’s angle‐independent –μ₀ r/4 (dM/dt).  
   • The torques/total angular momenta given are therefore different.

3. Part (c): both give a qualitative source, but earlier parts already disagree.

Because several required sub-answers differ, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different explicit formulas for every required quantity:

1. Reflection angle:
   • Candidate 1: tan θ_R = (1−β²) sin θ_I / [(1+β²) cos θ_I − 2β]  
   • Candidate 2: θ_R = θ_I  

2. Transmission angle:
   • Candidate 1: complicated β-dependent formula for tan θ_T  
   • Candidate 2: θ_T = arcsin[(n₁/n₂) sin θ_I] (no β dependence)  

3. Reflection coefficient:
   • Candidate 1: R = [(1 − 2β cos θ_I + β²)/(1 − β²)] R′  
   • Candidate 2: only a qualitative statement, no formula  

4. Transmission coefficient:
   • Candidate 1: T = 1 − R  
   • Candidate 2: only qualitative statement  

Because the expressions differ and Candidate 2 omits explicit coefficients, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different explicit results for both the angles and the coefficients.  
Candidate 1 supplies non-trivial formulas that depend on β, while Candidate 2 asserts that the angles remain unchanged (θ_R = θ_I, θ_T = θ_I) and only qualitatively notes effects on the coefficients. Therefore the answers are not the same.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are answering four requested sub-parts (a)–(d).  
Comparison of each sub-answer:

a. Both give L/1000 → same.  
b. Candidate 1 supplies two widths L/5 and L/10; Candidate 2 also lists L/5 and L/10 but as separate “answer 2” and “answer 3”. That could correspond, so potentially same.  
c. Candidate 1 gives 100 fringes; Candidate 2 gives 200 → different.  
d. Candidate 1’s answer is truncated/incomplete; Candidate 2 gives “∞”. Even ignoring the truncation, they are not identical.

Because at least one sub-answer differs and another is incomplete, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2 and Rule 6).

The problem asks for two separate results, (a) and (b).  
Both candidates supply answers for both parts, so we compare each corresponding pair.

(b) Threshold frequency:  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give  
ω_p = √(n e² / ε₀ m).  
These are identical.

(a) Wave-vector k(ω):  
Candidate 1: k = (ω / c) √[1 – (ω_p / ω)²]  
Candidate 2: k = √[ ω² / c² – ω_p² / ω² ].

Rewrite Candidate 2 with a common factor:  
k = (ω / c) √[1 – (ω_p² c²) / ω⁴].

Inside the square root the second term differs by a factor c² / ω² compared with Candidate 1’s expression. The two formulas are not algebraically identical (unless by coincidence ω = c, which is not generally true). Therefore the answers for part (a) are different.

Because one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

The problem has two sub-parts.  
• Part (a) requires an explicit angular-distribution formula.  
• Part (b) asks for a comparison of maximum intensities.

Candidate 1 only supplies one formula and never states any result for part (b).  
Candidate 2 supplies both an explicit formula (different in angular dependence from Candidate 1’s) and a numerical ratio (49) for part (b).

Because Candidate 1 omits an answer to sub-problem (b) and the formulas given in part (a) are not the same, the two candidates are not equivalent according to Rule 2 (and also differ in content for part (a)).

The two candidates give different results for several required sub-answers:

• Focal length of the mirror: candidate 1 gives +21 m, candidate 2 gives –21 m.  
• Number of stages: three (cand 1) vs. two (cand 2).  
• Final image position: 12 m left of lens (cand 1) vs. 16.8 m left (cand 2).  
• Total magnification: –1/7 ≈ –0.142857 (cand 1) vs. –0.2 (cand 2).

Since multiple required values disagree, the answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates are not equivalent.  

Candidate 1 gives a vector force whose magnitude is  
(¼) π μ₀ R⁴ σ² ω²,  

whereas Candidate 2 gives a scalar magnitude of  
(½) π μ₀ R⁴ σ² ω².  

The magnitudes differ by a factor of 2, and Candidate 1 also specifies a direction (−ẑ) while Candidate 2 does not. Hence the answers are different.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give visibly different expressions:

1. Candidate 1’s formulas depend explicitly on both space coordinates and on time (the term “β x′ + c t′”) and include a Lorentz factor γ in front of the whole field.  
2. Candidate 2’s formulas depend only on spatial coordinates (no time term) and scale the x-component of E by (1 − v₀²/c²)=1/γ², not by γ, and their B field has a different sign and component structure.

Even ignoring that Candidate 1’s expressions are incomplete (missing their denominators and closing brackets), the two sets of vectors are plainly not the same functional forms. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: v = (128 m g R)/(5 π μ²)

Candidate 1 depends on μ₀, σ, t and has R⁴; Candidate 2 contains none of those factors and instead has π and only R¹. There is no standard identity that would make these two formulas the same. Hence, according to Rule 1 (units/parameters) and general comparison, the predictions are not equivalent.

The problem has two sub-parts, so both answers must match for (a) and for (b).

(a)  
• Candidate 1 uses (mΩ + 2 mK)² – (mp + mK)².  
• Candidate 2 uses (mΩ + mK⁺ + mK⁰)² – (mK⁻ + mp)².  
These are not identical unless one assumes all kaon masses are exactly equal and calls each of them “mK”. The question lists the kaons separately, so the two formulas are not strictly the same.

(b)  
• Candidate 1 gives the maximum angle as π (180°).  
• Candidate 2 gives arctan(3/4) (≈ 37°).

Since the two candidates disagree in part (b) (and also differ in detail for part (a)), the answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give the same Clebsch–Gordan coefficients in part (a), but they give different cross-section ratios in part (b).  
Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the overall answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 answers both sub-parts:

a) Gives explicit Clebsch–Gordan expansion  
b) Gives two cross-section ratios: Δ resonance 9 : 1 : 2, N* resonance 0 : 2 : 1.

Candidate 2 supplies only the ratios 3 : 1 : 1 and 0 : 1 : 2, and omits the CG coefficients required in part (a).  
Even for the ratios, the numbers differ from Candidate 1.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 supplies two quantities (flux Φ and area S) and its area formula is

The two S expressions differ by exchanging e ↔ ħ c/B, hence they are not the same; moreover, Candidate 1 omits the flux quantization part that the question also requests.  
Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
The two expressions differ both in their dependence on B (one is proportional to B, the other is proportional to 1/B) and in the constants that multiply the bracketed term (one has e/ħ, the other has ħ with no e). Therefore the two candidates are not mathematically equivalent.

   6.70000 GeV vs 6.68000 GeV differ at the third significant digit, so they are not the same.

2. Whether Earth’s magnetic field is strong enough  
   • Candidate 1: gives a required field value (3.49 × 10⁻³ T ≈ 35 G) but does not explicitly state “yes” or “no”.  
   • Candidate 2: explicitly answers “No”.  

   Because Candidate 1 omits the explicit yes/no answer, the sub-answers do not match (Rule 2).

Since both sub-answers disagree, the overall predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 do not provide the same set of fusion reactions, energies, or neutron-usage explanations:

1. Fusion reactions:
   • Candidate 1 lists two separate D–D branches plus D–T (omits D–³He).  
   • Candidate 2 lists D–T, D–D, and D–³He.

2. Energies: the two candidates give different energy lists corresponding to their different reactions.

3. Neutron use: the explanations differ (fission/Li breeding vs. direct heat production).

Because the required sub-answers do not match, the two responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).

These two expressions are clearly different:

Candidate 1: L₀ = π √(3A/B)

Candidate 2: L₀ = π √(B/A)

The radicands are reciprocals (up to the extra factor of 3), so the two formulas do not match. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

The question requires three separate answers (frequency, wavelength, ratio, plus explanation).  
Comparing each sub-answer:

1. Frequency:  
   • Candidate 1: 5.15 × 10⁹ Hz  
   • Candidate 2: 5.06 × 10⁹ Hz  
   Values differ beyond 6 significant digits → not equivalent (Rule 4).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 must be compared for each of the four requested sub-answers (a)–(d).

1. Part (a): Both give 46 GeV → same.
2. Part (b):  
   • Candidate 1: 8.30 × 10^6 GeV = 8.30 TeV × 10^3 = 8 300 TeV  
   • Candidate 2: 8.28 TeV = 8.28 × 10^3 GeV  
   → Values differ by three orders of magnitude. Not equivalent.
3. Parts (c) and (d):  
   • Candidate 1 provides only symbols/formulas (“E_{e^+}”, etc.)—no definite numerical answers.  
   • Candidate 2 supplies definite numbers (92 GeV, 0; 46 GeV).  
   → Not equivalent.

Since at least one part differs and Candidate 1 is missing concrete answers for others, the two candidate predictions are not equivalent.

The question has 4 separate sub-parts; both candidates supply 4 answers.

Compare each sub-answer:
(a) L: both say 1  → same  
(b) S: both say 1  → same  
(c) probability for opposite spins: both say 0 → same  
(d) angular dependence:  
 • Candidate 1: dP/dΩ = (3/8π) sin²θ  
 • Candidate 2: sin²θ  

These are not identical; Candidate 2 omits the (3/8π) normalization factor. Because the problem asks for the probability per unit solid angle (not merely the shape), that constant matters. Hence the two answers differ for part (d).

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same algebraic fraction once signs are taken into account:

• Candidate 1:  (m_K^2 − m_π^2 + (m_Λ − m_p)^2) / [2 (m_Λ − m_p)]

• Candidate 2:  (m_π^2 − m_K^2 − (m_p − m_Λ)^2) / [2 (m_p − m_Λ)] c²

Because
  (m_p − m_Λ) = −(m_Λ − m_p)
and
  (m_p − m_Λ)² = (m_Λ − m_p)²,

the numerator of candidate 2 is the negative of the numerator of candidate 1 and the denominator is likewise negated. The two negatives cancel, giving the same fraction. The only extra factor is the explicit c² in candidate 2; in natural (c = 1) units this factor is 1. Including or omitting c² is a conventional choice of units, not a substantive difference.

Hence the two expressions are equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give the same algebraic fraction  
  (mK^2 − mπ^2 + (mΛ – mp)^2) / [2 (mΛ – mp)].

Candidate 2 has an overall factor c^2 while Candidate 1 omits it.  
In relativistic particle‐physics problems it is conventional (and explicitly allowed by the question wording) to work in natural units c = 1, in which case the extra c^2 simply equals 1. Thus, once the units are made consistent, the two expressions represent the same physical quantity.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical value of 2.044 MeV.

Candidate 2 expresses the answer as (3/2) mₑc².  Using the known value mₑc² ≈ 0.511 MeV, this equals 0.7665 MeV.

2.044 MeV ≠ 0.7665 MeV (they differ by more than 6 significant digits).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The problem asks for two answers:

(a) β  
(b) rest energy of the meson (an energy, so units of MeV)

Candidate 1:  
(a) 1/3  
(b) 136 MeV / c²  (unit of mass, not energy)

Candidate 2:  
(a) 1/3  
(b) 96 √2 ≈ 135.764 MeV  (unit of energy)

Comparing:

1. Part (a): both give 1/3 → same.  
2. Part (b): values differ numerically (136 vs ≈135.764, not identical to 6 significant digits) and units differ (MeV/c² vs MeV).

Because at least one sub-answer is different, the overall answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 supplies answers for part (a) and part (b), whereas Candidate 2 supplies only the part (a) answer. Since the problem asks for answers to three parts, the two sets of responses are not identical; Candidate 2 is missing required information that Candidate 1 attempts to provide. Therefore, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent. 

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give the same formula for the scattered wavelength (λ′), because “m” in Candidate 1 can be understood as the electron rest mass m_e.  

For the kinetic energy, however:

• Candidate 1: T₁ = [(1 − cos θ) hc / λ] / [ (1 − cos θ) + (m c λ)/h ]

• Candidate 2: K₂ = [hc (1 − cos θ)] / [ λ + (h/(m c)) (1 − cos θ) ]

Algebraically, D₁ = (m c / h) D₂, and N₁ = N₂ / λ, so  
T₁ = K₂ · h/(λ m c), which is not generally equal to K₂.  

Hence the kinetic-energy expressions are different.  
Since at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give

(a) the same Compton–shift formula  
  λ′ = λ + (h / mₑc)(1 − cos θ).

(b) algebraically equivalent expressions for the recoiling electron’s kinetic energy:  
 Candidate 1: T = [(1 − cos θ)(hc/λ)] / [1 − cos θ + (mₑc λ)/h]  
 Candidate 2: K = hc/λ − hc/λ′

The latter can be rewritten to match the former, showing they are the same quantity.

Thus the two sets of answers are equivalent.

The question asks for one conservation law per decay.  

Candidate 1 supplies for each decay either one or two laws; Candidate 2 supplies exactly one law.  
For every sub-problem, Candidate 1’s list of laws is therefore not identical to Candidate 2’s list (extra laws appear in Candidate 1’s answers for decays 1 and 2, and different laws appear for decay 3).  

According to Rule 2, when both candidates answer all sub-problems, every answer must match exactly; any discrepancy means the candidates are not equivalent. Hence the two sets of answers are not the same.

The two candidates are not equivalent.  
They differ on reaction 2’s stated reason (C-parity vs. ordinary parity) and, more critically, on reaction 6’s classification (Candidate 1: forbidden; Candidate 2: allowed).
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different answers for reaction 2:  
• Both say it is forbidden, but Candidate 1 cites non-conservation of C-parity, while Candidate 2 cites parity violation.  
Since the question explicitly asks for the reason when a reaction is forbidden, the two responses are not identical.  

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same formula for the photon energy (up to the usual c-factor convention) and the same numerical value 25 eV, but:

  – Candidate 1 does not give it.  
  – Candidate 2 says “X-ray”.

• Part (c) asks how a shorter lifetime would change the answer:  
  – Candidate 1 gives a qualitative explanation.  
  – Candidate 2 gives only “X-ray”, which does not address the question.

Since each candidate omits or mishandles one of the required sub-answers, their overall responses are not equivalent.

Both candidates select the same two experiments, (a) electron scattering and (b) muonic-atom energy levels, and identify the same physical quantities:

• Electron scattering: Candidate 1 gives the elastic form factor F(q²); Candidate 2 describes the scattering cross-section that probes the charge distribution—the same quantity expressed more descriptively.

• Muonic atoms: Candidate 1 gives the energy shift ΔE of the muonic levels; Candidate 2 states that the energy levels of the muonic atom are measured. These are the same.

Both candidates then relate these quantities to the nuclear radius (Candidate 1 expressly with formulas, Candidate 2 qualitatively). The selections and relationships coincide, and no required component is missing from either answer.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

   • Candidate 2 supplies answers for all three parts, including an isoscalar/isovector operator for (b).

2. Because Candidate 1 omits an answer required for sub-part (b), while Candidate 2 provides it, the two submissions differ in completeness and therefore are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The question effectively asks for five numerical coefficients (volume, surface, Coulomb, asymmetry, pairing).  
Both candidates list five coefficients in the same units (MeV), so direct comparison is possible.

Comparing each pair of coefficients to 6 significant digits:

1. Volume: 15.835 MeV vs 15.8 MeV  → differ in the 4-th significant digit (15.835 ≠ 15.8000).
2. Surface: 18.33 MeV vs 18.3 MeV  → differ in the 4-th significant digit (18.3300 ≠ 18.3000).
3. Coulomb: 0.714 MeV vs 0.71 MeV  → differ in the 4-th significant digit (0.714000 ≠ 0.710000).
4. Asymmetry: 92.80 MeV vs 23.2 MeV  → completely different order of magnitude.
5. Pairing: 11.20 MeV vs 12.0 MeV  → differ in the 3-rd significant digit (11.2000 ≠ 12.0000).

Since at least one required sub-answer differs (and in fact all differ), the two sets are not identical.  
By Rule 2 and Rule 4, the candidates are therefore not equivalent.

These values differ by many orders of magnitude, so they are clearly not the same.

Similar large discrepancies exist in parts (b)–(d) as well (time, magnetic field, deflection angle). Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two sets of predictions are not equivalent under Rule 2.

Both candidates select the same two experiments (Stern–Gerlach and Compton) and give similar descriptions, but they provide different years for the Stern–Gerlach experiment (Candidate 1: 1921, Candidate 2: 1922). Under Rule 2, when a question requires multiple pieces of information, all corresponding parts of the answers must be exactly identical for equivalence. Because the years differ, the answers are not identical. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give

Candidate 1: Eₙ = [h α (β+1) n E₀^β]^{1/(β+1)}

Candidate 2: Eₙ = (2π ħ α n E₀^β)^{1/(β+1)}

Using h = 2π ħ converts candidate 1’s bracket to (2π ħ α (β+1) n E₀^β).  
Thus candidate 1 differs from candidate 2 by an extra multiplicative factor (β+1) inside the bracket, which after taking the (β+1)-th root becomes (β+1)^{1/(β+1)}.

Since β is positive, this factor is not 1, so the two expressions are not the same.

The two candidates give

Candidate 1: E = ħ ω + (α0 α)/√(α0² + 2 β)

Candidate 2: E = ħ ω + α √[ m ω /(m ω + 2 β ħ) ].

In standard harmonic-oscillator notation the inverse length parameter is  
α0 ≡ √(m ω / ħ).  Substituting this definition into Candidate 1 gives

(α0 α)/√(α0² + 2 β) = α √(m ω / ħ) / √(m ω / ħ + 2 β)
                     = α √[ m ω /(m ω + 2 β ħ) ].

After the substitution the correction term in Candidate 1 is identical to that in Candidate 2, and both complete energies are therefore the same.  Thus, the two predictions are equivalent.

Both candidates supply the same three antisymmetrized two-electron wave-functions (ψ₁₂, ψ₁₃, ψ₂₃) with identical forms.  
For part (b) neither candidate really gives a full derivation; Candidate 1 simply rewrites the required matrix element, while Candidate 2 states that the expression is correct. Because the question already supplies the expression and merely asks to “show” it, neither candidate actually performs a derivation, but both agree on the same result. Consequently, the substantive content of the two responses is the same.

The two candidates give different explicit results for several of the required quantities.

Example: for the Fermi case

• Partition-function expressions use different notation for the exponent (candidate 1 omits the β = 1/kT factor, candidate 2 includes it), already introducing an ambiguity in units (Rule 1).  
• More importantly, the internal-energy formulas are clearly different:  
 – Candidate 1:  U = (2εe^{-ε}+4εe^{-2ε}+3εe^{-3ε})/Z  
 – Candidate 2:  U = 9ε / Z  

These cannot both be correct and are not algebraically equivalent.  
Similar discrepancies appear in the Bose and Boltzmann parts.

Since at least one requested sub-answer differs, the overall answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The problem asks for separate results (partition function, mean energy, and configurations) for three statistical cases plus a discussion item.  
Both candidates supply answers for all requested parts, so we compare each corresponding answer.

1. Fermi–Dirac case – partition function  
   • Candidate 1: Z = 1 + 2 e^{-βε} + 2 e^{-2βε} + e^{-3βε}  
   • Candidate 2: Z = 1 + 4 e^{-βε} + e^{-2βε}  
   → Different expressions, therefore not equivalent.

Since at least one required sub-answer differs, the two overall submissions cannot be equivalent (Rule 2).

The question asks for two separate energy‐shift expressions (for the 1s and 2p states).  
Candidate 1 gives a non-zero formula for each state, while Candidate 2 gives a non-zero formula only for 1s and states ΔE₂p = 0. Because the 2p answers differ (non-zero vs zero) and the formulas differ in overall constants/units, the two candidates are not equivalent.
The question asks for two numerical expressions: the energy shifts of the 1s and 2p states.  
Both candidates give two formulas, so the number of sub-answers matches.

However, the forms of the answers differ:

1. Candidate 1 contains no factor of ε₀ (it is written in Gaussian units where e² already includes 1/4π ε₀).
2. Candidate 2 explicitly contains 1/ε₀ and an extra π in the denominator, i.e. it is written in SI units.

If one converts Candidate 1’s Gaussian expressions to SI (replace e² by e²/(4π ε₀)), the numerical coefficients become

• 1s:  (2/5)/(4π) = 1/(10 π)  instead of Candidate 2’s 7/30π  
• 2p:  1/1120 ÷ (4π) = 1/(4480 π)  instead of Candidate 2’s 11/3360

The coefficients clearly do not match. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for three separate items (a), (b), and (c).  

• Candidate 1 supplies answers for all three parts.  
• Candidate 2 supplies only a single formula (clearly meant for part (c)) and omits parts (a) and (b).

Because Candidate 2 does not provide the required answers for parts (a) and (b), the two submissions cannot be equivalent under Rule 2.  
(Even comparing the part (c) formulas alone, they differ by the factor inside the parentheses, so they are not the same anyway.)

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question has three sub-parts, so each candidate must supply three corresponding answers.

Sub-part (a):
• Candidate 1 gives the time-dependent Schrödinger equation  
  iħ ∂ψ/∂t = –(ħ²/2m)∇²ψ.  
• Candidate 2 gives the time-independent eigenvalue equation  
  –(ħ²/2m)∇²ψ = Eψ.  
These are not the same equation; thus the two candidates’ answers are different for (a).

Sub-part (b):
• Candidate 1 supplies a normalized ground-state wavefunction with the prefactor (2/L)^{3/2}.  
• Candidate 2 omits the normalization constant.  
Therefore their wavefunctions are not identical.

Sub-part (c):
The two formulae for N can be algebraically shown to be equivalent, but equivalence in this one part cannot compensate for the discrepancies in parts (a) and (b).

Because at least one sub-answer differs, Rule 2 declares the overall submissions inequivalent.

Both expressions can be related through the harmonic-oscillator identity ω² = k/m.

Candidate 1:  − q²E² / (2 m ω²)
  = − q²E² / [2 m (k/m)]
  = − q²E² / (2 k)

Candidate 2:  − q²E² / (2 k)

Since m ω² = k, both candidates give exactly the same energy shift.

The problem implicitly requires two coupled‐basis expansions because for the fixed magnetic quantum number  

m = l – 1/2  

there are two possible total angular momenta: j = l + 1/2 and j = l – 1/2.  
Thus one must give an expression for each of these two states.

• Candidate 1 supplies two separate formulas, one for j = l + 1/2 and one for j = l – 1/2.  
• Candidate 2 supplies only a single formula, covering at most one of those states.

Since Candidate 2 does not provide the second required state (and the single formula it gives is numerically different from either of Candidate 1’s), the two candidates’ predictions are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 supplies two separate decompositions:  

1. | l+½, l−½ ⟩ = √[2l / (2l+1)] | l, l−1; ½, ½ ⟩ + √[1 / (2l+1)] | l, l; ½, −½ ⟩  
2. | l−½, l−½ ⟩ = −√[1 / (2l+1)] | l, l−1; ½, ½ ⟩ + √[2l / (2l+1)] | l, l; ½, −½ ⟩  

Candidate 2 gives only one decomposition:
| l−½, l−½ ⟩ = √[(l−½)/(2l)] | l, l−1; ½, ½ ⟩ + √[(l+½)/(2l)] | l, l; ½, −½ ⟩

1. Number of answers: the problem asks for “those states |j,m⟩ for which m = l−½”, which includes both j = l+½ and j = l−½. Candidate 1 provides both; Candidate 2 provides only one. By Rule 2, that already makes them inequivalent.

2. Even for the single common state (j = l−½, m = l−½), the coefficients differ:
 Candidate 1 coefficient² = 2l/(2l+1);  
 Candidate 2 coefficient² = (l−½)/(2l) = (2l−1)/(4l).  
These are not equal in general, so the decompositions disagree.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

   |ψ⟩ = (1/√N) ∑_{n=1}^{N} e^{i (2π m / N)(n−1)} |n⟩ (again with m ↔ j).

512/729 ≈ 0.702332.  
Comparing the first probabilities to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):  

• Candidate 1: 0.702000  
• Candidate 2: 0.702332  

They differ from the fourth significant digit onward, so the first answers are not equal.

whereas Candidate 2 gives

The two expressions can be rewritten in the same form:

Candidate 2  
ΔE = (4 |E₀| R²)/(3 a₀²)  
But |E₀| = e²/(2 a₀), so  
ΔE = (4 (e²/2 a₀) R²)/(3 a₀²) = (2 e² R²)/(3 a₀³).

This is exactly Candidate 1’s result:  
ΔE = (2 e² R²)/(3 a₀³).

Hence the two candidates give the same prediction.

Candidate 2 gives

Comparing:

1. Units/constant structure: Candidate 2 contains the explicit electrostatic factor ε₀ (SI) and a factor π, whereas Candidate 1 has neither. Unless an entire 1/(4 π ε₀) has been implicitly absorbed, the unit systems are different and the numerical factors do not match.

2. Numerical coefficient: Even ignoring the ε₀ and π difference, the pure number coefficients are 2/3 ≈ 0.6667 vs 1/6 ≈ 0.1667, differing by a factor of 4.

Therefore the two expressions are not the same.

Candidate 1 gives the three energy values as 2 A ħ², –A ħ², –3 A ħ² and explicitly pairs each with its degeneracy (7, 5, 3).  

Candidate 2 lists six items in sequence: 2 A, 7, –A, 5, –3 A, 3.  
• It omits the ħ² factor in every energy value.  
• It does not explicitly label which numbers are energies and which are degeneracies; the reader must guess the intended pairing.

The question has two sub-parts, (a) and (b).  
Both candidates give answers for both parts, so we must compare each corresponding pair.

Part (a):
• Candidate 1: dσ/dΩ = (2m B a/ħ²)² [sin(q a)/q]².  
   With q = 2k sin(θ/2), this becomes (m²B²a²/ħ⁴k²) sin²(2k a sin(θ/2))/sin²(θ/2).
• Candidate 2: dσ/dΩ = (m²B²a²/ħ⁴k²) sin²(2k a sin(θ/2))/sin²(θ/2).

These are algebraically identical, so the (a) answers agree.

Part (b):
• Candidate 1: dσ/dΩ ≈ [1/(2mB/ħ² + 1/a)]².
• Candidate 2: dσ/dΩ = 4m²B²a⁴/ħ⁴ = (2mB a²/ħ²)².

These two expressions are not the same except for very special parameter choices. Hence the (b) answers disagree.

The question effectively calls for (at least) two things:  
1) the equality  
   |ψ(0)|² = (m/2π)⟨dV/dr⟩ − (1/2π)⟨L²/r³⟩,  
2) a classical interpretation for L ≠ 0.

Candidate 2 supplies only the first equality.  
Candidate 1 supplies that same equality, but then adds two further equalities

   ⟨dV/dr⟩ = (1/m)⟨L²/r³⟩  and  dV/dr = (1/m)L²/r³,

which are not requested and, in general, are not equivalent to the statement in the problem (they would imply |ψ(0)|² = 0).

Because Candidate 1 states additional, non-requested, and generally incorrect relations while Candidate 2 does not, the two responses are not the same according to Rule 2 (different sets of answers for a multi-part question) and Rule 6 (type/ content mismatch).

Candidate 1 lists three “answers.”  
• Answer 1 gives the formula requested in the problem.  
• Answers 2 and 3 add another equality that is not asked for and, in doing so, implicitly set |ψ(0)|² = 0, but they do not provide any verbal classical interpretation.

Candidate 2 supplies the same formula as in Answer 1 and then explicitly gives the required classical interpretation (“for non-zero angular momentum the particle avoids the origin, so |ψ(0)|²=0”).

Because the task has two parts (formula + classical interpretation):

– Candidate 2 satisfies both parts.  
– Candidate 1 only supplies the formula and extra equalities but does not give the classical interpretation explicitly.

Therefore the two responses are not equivalent.

Reasoning:  
Both candidates list four energy levels, but Candidate 1 writes each level with explicit factors of ℏ (e.g. ℏA + ℏ²B/4), whereas Candidate 2 omits all ℏ factors (A + B/4, etc.). Since the question’s constants A and B are the same for both answers, this discrepancy means the two candidates are expressed in different units/scales, giving different numerical values unless one arbitrarily sets ℏ = 1. According to Rule 1, such an omission that changes the units makes the answers inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The Hamiltonian involves the spin operators, whose eigenvalues carry explicit factors of ħ.  

Candidate 1 keeps those factors, giving levels like “ħ A + (ħ²/4) B”.  
Candidate 2 drops all ħ’s, writing simply “A + B/4”, etc.

Nothing in the problem statement says that units with ħ = 1 should be used, so the omission of ħ in Candidate 2 makes its energies dimensionally different from those of Candidate 1.  
Because the two answers differ by factors of ħ (i.e., they are in different units) and the question does not authorize setting ħ = 1, Rule 1 says the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates list four energy levels each, but every level in Candidate 1 carries extra factors of ℏ (ℏ A or ℏ² B) that do not appear in Candidate 2. Since both answers use the same symbols A and B without stating that they have been rescaled, those additional ℏ factors make the numerical expressions different. Hence the two sets of energies are not the same.

The question has two sub-problems.  

Sub-problem (a):  
• Candidate 1 gives a non-zero energy shift, \( \frac{mV_0^{2}}{\hbar^{2}} e^{-2mV_0 d/\hbar^{2}} \).  
• Candidate 2 states the energy shift is exactly zero.  
These are not the same result; an exponentially small value is not equal to zero. Hence the answers differ for sub-problem (a).

Sub-problem (b):  
Both candidates give the equivalent condition \(V_0 d > \hbar^{2}/(2m)\).

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates’ overall predictions are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both give the same expression for part (a).

For part (b):
• Candidate 1 provides only a prefactor, omitting the Gaussian exponential, and its width contains an i (a² + 2 iħt/m).  
• Candidate 2 includes the exponential but its width lacks the factor i (a² + 2ħt/m).

Thus their answers for (b) are different (and Candidate 1 is incomplete). Since the problem has two sub-parts and the answers to one sub-part differ, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Both candidates give a single formula for the differential cross-section.  

Candidate 1 uses  
σ(θ) = 4 μ²V₀² / [ħ⁴(2k sin(θ/2))⁶] · [sin(2kR sin(θ/2)) − 2kR sin(θ/2) cos(2kR sin(θ/2))]².

Candidate 2 uses  
σ = 4 m²V₀² / (ħ⁴q⁶) · [sin(qR) − qR cos(qR)]².

If one identifies the usual momentum-transfer variable q = 2k sin(θ/2) and notes that, for a heavy target, the reduced mass μ ≈ m (the nucleon mass), then

(2k sin(θ/2))⁶ = q⁶  
sin(2kR sin(θ/2)) = sin(qR)  
2kR sin(θ/2) = qR,

so Candidate 1 becomes exactly the same expression as Candidate 2. Hence the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1 has the prefactor  

(2¹⁵ / 3¹⁰) a₀² ≈ 0.555 a₀²,

whereas Candidate 2 has the prefactor  

(128 / 6561)(1 / a₀²) ≈ 0.0195 a₀⁻².

The dependence on a₀ is opposite (a₀² vs a₀⁻²) and the numerical constants differ. Therefore the two results are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not the same.

• Numerators  
  – Candidate 1: 2¹⁵ a₀² e² E₀²  
  – Candidate 2: (32 √6 a₀)² e² E₀² = 32²·6 a₀² e² E₀² = 6144 a₀² e² E₀²  
  The ratio of the two numerators is 32768 / 6144 = 16 / 3.

• Denominators  
  – Candidate 1: 3¹⁰ ħ² (Γ²+ω²)  
  – Candidate 2: (243 π)² ħ² (Γ²+ω²) = 3¹⁰ π² ħ² (Γ²+ω²)  
  Candidate 2 has an extra factor of π² in the denominator.

So Candidate 1 differs from Candidate 2 by an overall factor of (16/3) × (1/π²) ≈ 0.54, hence they are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions are not the same.

Constant in Candidate 1: 2¹⁵ / 3¹⁰  
Constant in Candidate 2: 1024 / 243² = 2¹⁰ / 3¹⁰  

They differ by a factor of 2⁵ = 32. Therefore the probabilities predicted by the two candidates are different (and Candidate 1 also labels the result specifically for 2p, while Candidate 2 claims it for “any n = 2” state).

The two candidates are not equivalent.

1. For the k-space orbit area S:

   • Candidate 1: S = (n + ½) · (2π e B)/(ħ c)  
   • Candidate 2: S = (n + ½) · (2π ħ B)/e  (because h = 2πħ)

   The coefficients in front of (n + ½) B differ by the factor  
   (e /(ħ c)) ÷ (ħ /e) = e² /(ħ² c), so the formulas are not the same.

2. The question also asks for a flux quantization condition; Candidate 2 supplies Φ, but Candidate 1 does not.

Hence the candidates give different results and are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 provides only one formula (for S) and omits the separate flux-quantization formula that the question also asks for.  
Moreover, even that single formula differs from Candidate 2’s S formula by a factor (they are not algebraically equal). Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
Reasoning:

The problem has three sub-parts.  
Both candidates give answers for all three parts, so we compare each sub-answer.

(a) Eigenfunction  
• C1: ψ(θ)=1/√(2π) e^{ikθ}  
• C2: ψ_n(θ)=1/√(2π) e^{inθ}  
Same expression (k vs n), so equivalent for part (a).

(b) Number of electrons per level  
• C1: “0^2 1^4 2^4 3^4 4^4” (i.e. 2 in m=0, 4 in each of ±1, ±2, ±3, ±4)  
• C2: “2, 4, 4, 4, 4” (same counts in the same order)  
Equivalent for part (b).

(c) Lowest excitation energy and wavelength  
• Energy: C1 gives the formula ΔE = 9ħ²/(2mr²); C2 gives a numerical value 2.14 eV. Evaluating C1 with r = 4 Å gives 2.145 eV, which differs from 2.14 eV beyond the 6-significant-digit requirement of Rule 4 (2.14500 vs 2.14000).  
• Wavelength: C1 states 5800 Å (= 580 nm); C2 states 579 nm. 580 nm vs 579 nm differ at the third significant digit, so they also fail the 6-digit match.

Because part (c) answers are not identical to the required precision, the two candidates are not equivalent overall.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give identical answers for parts (a), (b), and (c).  
For part (d) they list the same set of eigenvalues, but their third eigenvector differs:

• Candidate 1’s third vector  (4, 2, 5)/(3√5) is indeed an eigenvector of the matrix with eigenvalue 7.  
• Candidate 2’s third vector  (4/(3√5), 2/(3√5), 1/√5) is not proportional to Candidate 1’s (their z-component differs), and direct multiplication by the matrix shows it is not an eigenvector at all. Hence the two answers are not equivalent for part (d).

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

Key differences:

1. Energy spectrum  
   • Candidate 1:   E = p_z²/(2m) − (n + ½) (eħH₀)/(mc) (negative Landau term).  
   • Candidate 2:   E = ħω_c (n + ½) + (π²ħ² n_z²)/(2mL²) (positive Landau term).

   The signs of the Landau‐level term are opposite and Candidate 2 includes quantization in z (n_z) that Candidate 1 does not.

2. Degeneracy  
   • Candidate 1: none given.  
   • Candidate 2: g_n = (eH₀L²)/(2πħc).

3. Eigenfunctions  
   The explicit forms differ and Candidate 1 omits the y-dependence and degeneracy labeling present in the standard Landau functions of Candidate 2.

Because required components (energy, degeneracy, eigenfunctions) disagree or are missing and the energies are not the same, the answers are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

Key points:

1. Energy spectrum:
   • Candidate 1: E = p_z²/(2m)  –  (n + ½) (eħH₀)/(mc)  
   • Candidate 2: E = p_z²/(2m) + (n + ½) ħω_c  (ω_c = eH₀/m)

   Candidate 1 has the Landau term with the opposite sign to the standard result quoted by Candidate 2. Hence the energies differ.

2. Degeneracy:
   • Candidate 1 does not state the degeneracy at all.  
   • Candidate 2 gives D = L²mH₀/(2πħ).

   The omission alone makes the answers inequivalent (Rule 2).

3. Eigenfunctions:
   • Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 present different forms; moreover the sign in Candidate 1’s Gaussian factor disagrees with the usual Landau wave-function given by Candidate 2.

Because the energy expressions disagree, the degeneracy is missing in Candidate 1, and the eigenfunctions are not the same, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 do not give the same results.

1. Energy levels  
   • Candidate 1:  E = p_z²/(2m) − (n+½) (eħH₀)/(mc) (negative Landau term)  
   • Candidate 2:  E = p_z²/(2m) + (n+½) (eħH₀)/(mc) (positive Landau term)  
   The signs of the magnetic contribution differ, so the energies are different.

2. Degeneracy  
   • Candidate 1: gives no explicit degeneracy.  
   • Candidate 2: states degeneracy = (eH₀L²)/ħ.  
   Missing information in Candidate 1 means they cannot be equivalent.

3. Eigenfunctions  
   Even the Gaussian factor in Candidate 1 has the opposite sign to the usual Landau form given by Candidate 2, so the wave-functions differ as well.

Because they disagree on energy, degeneracy, and wavefunctions, the two answers are inequivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different signs for the Landau-level term in the energy and differ on degeneracy (Candidate 1 does not state it, Candidate 2 says it is infinite). Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

The problem has three separate sub-questions, so every sub-answer must correspond.

Sub-answer (a)  
• Candidate 1:  ψ*(–t)  
• Candidate 2:  ψ_T(t)=ψ*(–t)  
These are the same.

Sub-answer (b)  
• Candidate 1:  Ĥ=(eħ/2mc) σ_z H_z  
• Candidate 2:  Ĥ=– μ·𝐇 with 𝐇 = H_z ẑ + H_y ŷ  

Candidate 2 explicitly includes an extra H_y term that is absent in the question for part (b) and absent in Candidate 1’s answer. Therefore the two answers to (b) are different.

Because at least one sub-answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each give answers for both parts (a) and (b), but:

Part (a):
• Candidate 1: P = (4/9) sin²[(3 ω₁ t)/2]  
• Candidate 2: P = (4/9) sin²[(3 ħ ω₁ t)/2]

The two formulas differ by a factor ħ inside the trigonometric argument; they are not the same expression unless one implicitly sets ħ = 1, which is not stated. Hence the two answers are not identical.

Part (b):
• Candidate 1: smallest detectable ħω₁ = 0.05 eV  
• Candidate 2: smallest detectable ħω₁ = 1.0 × 10¹⁵ eV·s (and claims it is independent of M₀)

These numerical results (and even their units) are entirely different.

Because at least one sub-answer differs for each part, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both expressions can be rewritten in the same form:

Candidate 1  
(1/6) · (4/x² + 1) · √(4/x² + 1)  
= (1/6) · [(4 + x²)/x²] · {[(4 + x²)/x²]¹ᐟ²}  
= (1/6) · [(4 + x²)^{3/2} / x³]  
= (x² + 4)^{3/2} / (6x³)  + C.

Candidate 2 already has exactly this form. Hence the two answers represent the same antiderivative (differing only by the arbitrary constant, which is allowed).

Both candidates give the antiderivative in the form

(1/6) · (4 + x²)^(3/2) / x³  + C,

just written with different algebraic rearrangements:

• Candidate 1:  (1/6)(4/x² + 1)·√(4/x² + 1)
   = (1/6)((4 + x²)/x²)^(3/2)
   = (1/6)(4 + x²)^(3/2) / x³.

• Candidate 2:  (x² + 4)^(3/2) / (6x³).

These expressions are identical (up to the naming/order of factors and the constant of integration). Therefore the two answers are equivalent.
The two antiderivatives can be compared by rewriting Candidate 1:

Candidate 1: (1/6)(4/x²+1)√(4/x²+1)
            = (1/6) (4+x²)/x² · √(4+x²)/|x|
            = (4+x²)^{3/2} /(6 x² |x|).

Candidate 2: (4+x²)^{3/2} /(6 x³).

Thus the two expressions coincide only when |x| = x, i.e. for x > 0.  
For x < 0 they differ by a sign that is not a constant difference, so the antiderivatives are not equivalent on the whole domain.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s response is the statement “cos(a) = −24/25,” which leaves the argument a unspecified in the answer itself, whereas Candidate 2 simply gives the numeric value “−24/25.”  
Since Candidate 1 does not explicitly identify a with 2 · arctan(−7), its answer is not just the single numeric value requested, but an equation involving an undefined variable. Thus the two responses are not the same object or value.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates ultimately convey the same numerical value.

• Candidate 1 states “cos(a) = –24/25,” which implies the evaluated cosine equals –24/25.
• Candidate 2 gives the number “–24/25.”

Since the required answer is that numerical value, and both supply –24/25 (identical up to 6 significant digits), they are equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an additive constant:

1.  The logarithmic parts are the same, since  
   ln | (√(x-4) – √(x+4))/(√(x-4)+√(x+4)) |  
   equals  
   ln ((√(x+4)/√(x-4) – 1)/(√(x+4)/√(x-4)+1))  
   (the second is just the negative of the first inside the absolute value, giving the same positive ratio).

2.  For the algebraic parts, setting  
   u = √((x+4)/(x-4)), we have  

        Candidate 1: (x-20)u  
        Candidate 2: √(x²-16) – 16u  

   Their difference is  
        (x-20)u – [√(x²-16) – 16u] = (x-4)u – √(x²-16).  
   But (x-4)u = (x-4)·√((x+4)/(x-4)) = √((x-4)(x+4)) = √(x²-16),  
   so the difference is 0 (a constant).

Hence the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives (they differ at most by an overall constant of integration).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both expressions differ only by an additive constant ( 24 ln 2 ), which is irrelevant for an antiderivative. Therefore the two candidates give equivalent answers.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give an antiderivative of  

∫[(x+4)/(x-4)]^{3/2} dx, written in different forms.

Common part: (x-20)·√[(x+4)/(x-4)]

Log-terms to compare  
Candidate 1: −12 ln | (√(x−4)−√(x+4)) / (√(x−4)+√(x+4)) |  
Candidate 2: +12 ln | x + √(x²−16) |

Using the algebraic identity  

 x + √(x²−16) = 4 · (√(x−4)+√(x+4))² / |√(x−4)+√(x+4)|²
        = constant · (√(x−4)+√(x+4)) / |√(x−4)−√(x+4)|,

one finds

 12 ln|x + √(x²−16)| = −12 ln |(√(x−4)−√(x+4))/(√(x−4)+√(x+4))| + 24 ln 2,

i.e. the two logarithmic expressions differ only by the constant 24 ln 2.  
Because indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary additive constant, this constant difference is irrelevant.

Therefore Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 represent the same family of antiderivatives and are equivalent.

The question requires two specific answers: the center of convergence and the radius of convergence.  
Candidate 1 explicitly states:

1. Center = 1/2  
2. Radius = 3/2  

Candidate 2 gives:  
“1/2, 3/2”

Interpreting Candidate 2 in the same order (center first, radius second) yields exactly the same numerical values: 1/2 and 3/2. Both candidates thus provide identical answers to each required part. No unit or ordering ambiguity arises.

Both candidates describe the same infinite set of solutions.

1. Candidate 1 writes
   x = π/2 − arcsin(4/5) + 2πn
   x = π/2 − arccos(3/5) + 2πn
   Since arcsin(4/5) = arccos(3/5) ≈ 53.13°, the two formulas are identical, giving
   x = π/2 − 53.13° + 2πn.

2. Candidate 2 writes
   x = arctan(3/4) + 2πk.
   Because arctan(3/4) ≈ 36.87° and π/2 − 53.13° = 36.87°, we have
   arctan(3/4) = π/2 − arcsin(4/5).

Therefore both candidates yield exactly the same solution set {π/2 − arcsin(4/5) + 2πℤ}. They are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates describe the same one-parameter family of solutions:

• Candidate 1: x = –arcsin(4/5) + π/2 + 2πn (the second written form is identical since arcsin(4/5) = arccos(3/5))  
• Candidate 2: x = arctan(3/4) + 2πk

Numerically, –arcsin(4/5) + π/2 = arctan(3/4) ≈ 0.643501…, so both sets are identical (just using different but equal constants and different integer symbols).

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

• Candidate 2:  [−π/2, −π/3) ∪ (π/3, π/2] (endpoints −π/2 and π/2 included)

Because the intervals are not written identically (open vs. closed at the endpoints) and Rule 2 requires every sub-answer to match exactly, the two overall predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates ultimately simplify to the same expression (up to an additive constant):

1. Candidate 1 simplifies to  
   cot(5x)csc(5x) + 2 cos(5x) − (3/2) ln((1+cos(5x))/(1−cos(5x)))

2. Using the identity  
   −(3/2) ln((1+cos θ)/(1−cos θ)) = 3 ln|tan(θ/2)|,  
   the logarithmic terms are identical. Thus Candidate 1 becomes  
   cot(5x)csc(5x) + 2 cos(5x) + 3 ln|tan(5x/2)| + C,

   which is exactly Candidate 2.

Since every term matches (they differ only by an arbitrary constant of integration), the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by an (absorbed) constant:

F₁(x) = −(1/8)cot⁸x − (1/3)cot⁶x − (1/4)cot⁴x  
F₂(x) = −1/(8 sin⁸x) + 1/(6 sin⁶x)

One can verify
 F₁(x) − F₂(x) = −1/24,
which is a constant, so the two expressions are the same up to the arbitrary integration constant.

Hence the answers are equivalent.

Both candidates provide the same eight possible rational zeros:

Candidate 1 lists them explicitly: {1, –1, 5, –5, 1/2, –1/2, 5/2, –5/2}.  
Candidate 2 uses “±” notation: ±1, ±1/2, ±5, ±5/2, which denotes exactly the same set {1, –1, 5, –5, 1/2, –1/2, 5/2, –5/2}.

Since the two answers correspond to identical sets and the question does not require any particular order, the candidates are equivalent.

The problem asks for two items:
1. Radius of convergence  
2. The sum of the series (i.e., the entire function represented by the power-series, including its value at x = 0).

Candidate 1  
Radius: ∞  
Sum: piecewise 
 • x ≠ 0: (e^x (x − 1)+1)/x²  
 • x = 0: ½

Candidate 2  
Radius: ∞  
Sum: (e^x (x − 1)+1)/x²  (no separate value given for x = 0)

While the two formulas coincide for x ≠ 0, Candidate 2 does not supply the x = 0 value, so its “sum” is undefined at the centre of the power series, whereas Candidate 1 supplies that missing value (½). Hence the two answers are not fully identical for the requested “sum of the series.”

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question requires two distinct pieces of information:  
1) the radius of convergence, and  
2) the explicit sum of the series (i.e., the value of the series for every x in its domain).

Candidate 1 supplies:  
• Radius R = ∞.  
• Sum f(x) = (1 + x eˣ − eˣ)/x² for x ≠ 0 and f(0) = ½.

Candidate 2 supplies:  
• Radius = ∞.  
• Sum = (1 − eˣ(1 − x))/x² (no separate specification for x = 0).

Although the two algebraic formulas coincide for x ≠ 0, Candidate 2 leaves the value at x = 0 undefined, whereas Candidate 1 explicitly provides the required value ½ there. Since the series definitely has a value at x = 0 (½), omitting it means Candidate 2 gives an incomplete answer to one of the required sub-problems.  
Thus the two candidates’ answers are not fully equivalent.

Both candidates give answers for all three requested objects.

1. Sphere: both give equation (x − 1)² + (y − 3)² + (z − 5)² = 9 and radius = 3. Identical.

2. Locus equidistant from the two points: both give y + 3z = 5. Identical.

3. Cylinder: candidate 1 writes (y − 3)² + (z − 5)² = 10², candidate 2 writes (y − 3)² + (z − 5)² = 100. Since 10² = 100, these are the same equation.

Thus every corresponding sub-answer is mathematically identical.

Both expressions can be simplified to the same form.

Candidate 1:  
(64 π − 32 π √2)/6

Candidate 2:  
(16 π/3)(2 − √2)  
= π(16)(2 − √2)/3  
= π(32 − 16 √2)/3.

Since both equal π(32 − 16 √2)/3, the two candidates represent the same numerical value.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers represent the same quantity:

Candidate 1:  (64 π − 32 π √2) / 6  
Factor out 32 π:  = 32 π(2 − √2)/6 = 16 π(2 − √2)/3.

Candidate 2:  (16 π/3)(2 − √2).

These two expressions are identical. Hence the candidates are equivalent.

The two candidates give different functional expressions:

• Candidate 1: y = |x| / 3 − 4  
• Candidate 2: y = x / 3 − 4

Because |x| ≠ x for negative x, the two expressions are not identical on the full domain where the differential equation could be defined (x ≠ 0). Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates are not equivalent.  
Candidate 1 includes an absolute‐value (|x|/3 − 4), which yields y = −x/3 − 4 for x < 0, whereas Candidate 2 is y = x/3 − 4 for all x. These expressions differ for negative x (and coincide only for x ≥ 0). Because the problem statement does not restrict x to positive values only, the answers are not the same.

Candidate 1: y = |x| / 3 – 4  
Candidate 2: y = x / 3 – 4  

For x ≥ 0 the two expressions coincide, because |x| = x.  
For x < 0 they differ: Candidate 1 gives y = –x / 3 – 4, whereas Candidate 2 gives y = x / 3 – 4.  
Since the two proposed functions are not identical on the same domain (all x ≠ 0), the answers are not equivalent.

The two series can be rewritten to the same form.

Candidate 1:  
∑_{k=0}^{∞} (−1)^{k+1} (k+1)/(k+3) · x^{k}

Candidate 2:  
∑_{k=0}^{∞} (−1)^{k} k x^{k−1}/(k+2)

For Candidate 2, drop the k = 0 term (it is zero) and set n = k − 1 (so k = n + 1, n = 0,1,2,…):

Coefficient becomes  
(−1)^{n+1} (n+1)/(n+3) and power x^{n}.

Thus Candidate 2 becomes  
∑_{n=0}^{∞} (−1)^{n+1} (n+1)/(n+3) · x^{n},

exactly Candidate 1.

Therefore the two answers are mathematically identical.

The two candidates give completely different antiderivative expressions:

Candidate 1:  
C + 25(4x-5)^{1/4} + (1/5)(4x-5)^{5/4} − (4/3)(4x-5)^{3/4} − (125/√5)·arctan[(4x-5)^{1/4}/√5]

Candidate 2:  
x − 2√(4x-5) + (25/2) ln(√(4x-5)+5) + C

1. The structural forms are very different (arctan term vs. logarithm term, different algebraic powers).
2. Differentiating Candidate 2 yields
   F′(x) = (u² + u + 5) / [u(u + 5)], where u = √(4x − 5);
   the original integrand is (u² + u + 5) / [√u (u + 5)].
   Hence F′(x) ≠ integrand, so Candidate 2 is not even a correct antiderivative.
3. Because Candidate 1 contains functions (arctan) that cannot be rewritten into Candidate 2’s form merely by adding a constant, the two results cannot differ only by a constant; they are inequivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives can differ only by an additive constant to be considered equivalent.

Rewrite Candidate 1 in powers of x:

Candidate 1 =  
−(1/3) x^{1/3}  − (2/27) ln[(1/3)(1+3x^{1/6})] − (3/2) x^{2/3} + (2/3) x^{1/2} + (2/9) x^{1/6} + const.

Candidate 2 =  
−(1/2) x^{2/3} + (2/9) x^{1/2} − (1/9) x^{1/3} + (2/27) x^{1/6} − (2/81) ln(1+3x^{1/6}) + const.

Compare term-by-term (ignoring possible constant shifts inside the logarithm):

• x^{2/3}:  −3/2  vs  −1/2  
• x^{1/2}:   2/3  vs   2/9  
• x^{1/3}:  −1/3  vs  −1/9  
• x^{1/6}:   2/9  vs   2/27  
• ln(1+3x^{1/6}): coefficient −2/27 vs −2/81

All coefficients differ, so the expressions cannot differ only by a constant. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ only by:

• an overall minus sign already incorporated consistently,  
• the presence/absence of an absolute-value in the logarithm (|…| versus …), which only affects the expression by a piece-wise constant, and  
• a factor 1/3 inside the logarithm for Candidate 1, which changes the log term by −(2/27)ln 3—a mere additive constant.

Since indefinite integrals are defined up to an arbitrary additive constant, the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

The two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant:

1. Power-term coefficients differ:
   • For x^(2/3): Candidate 1 has –3/2, Candidate 2 has –1/2.  
   • For x^(1/3): Candidate 1 has –1/3, Candidate 2 has –1/9.  
   (Similar mismatches appear in other powers.)

2. The logarithmic parts differ both in their coefficients (–2/27 vs –2/81) and in the arguments; even after accounting for ln( (1/3)(1+3x^(1/6)) ) = ln(1+3x^(1/6)) – ln 3, the coefficient mismatch leaves an x-dependent difference, not a mere constant.

Since their difference is not a constant, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two proposed integrals are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: ½ ∫_{–π/3}^{π/3} 4 dθ + ½ ∫_{π/3}^{5π/3} 16 cos²θ dθ

After simplifying:

– First parts of both candidates give the same value (4π/3).  
– Second parts are different:  
 Candidate 1 uses 16 ∫_{π/3}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ,  
 Candidate 2 uses 8 ∫_{π/3}^{5π/3} cos²θ dθ.

These integrals cover different θ-intervals and have different coefficients, resulting in very different values, so the totals are not equal.

Candidate 1 gives an antiderivative

F(x)=−2 cos(3x)/(5 sin^5(3x))−8 cos(3x)/(15 sin^3(3x))−16/15 cot(3x)+C.

Rewrite in terms of cot(3x)=cos(3x)/sin(3x) and csc(3x)=1/sin(3x):

F(x)=−2 cot csc^4−(8/15) cot csc^2−(16/15) cot.

Candidate 2 claims

G(x)=−2 cot(3x)−(4/3) cot^3(3x)−(2/5) cot^5(3x)+C.

Express F in pure powers of cot by using csc^2=1+cot^2:

F(x)=cot[−18/5−(68/15) cot^2−2 cot^4]+C,

whereas

G(x)=cot[−2−(4/3) cot^2−(2/5) cot^4]+C.

The inner polynomials (−18/5, −68/15, −2) and (−2, −4/3, −2/5) differ; thus F(x) and G(x) are not the same function up to an additive constant (their difference depends on x). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 simplifies to  
    −(2/5) cos(3x)/sin⁵(3x) − (8/15) cos(3x)/sin³(3x) − (16/15) cot(3x) + C.

Candidate 2 is  
    −2 cot(3x) − (4/3) cot³(3x) − (2/5) cot⁵(3x) + C  
= −2 cos/sin − (4/3) cos³/sin³ − (2/5) cos⁵/sin⁵ + C.

The powers of cosines in corresponding denominator powers (cos, cos³, cos⁵) do not match between the two expressions, so their difference is not a constant. Hence the two antiderivatives are not equivalent.

Both candidates present antiderivative expressions that differ only in algebraic form.

• Candidate 1 simplifies to  
   –2 cot(3x) – (4/3) cot³(3x) – (2/5) cot⁵(3x) + C  
   (by rewriting the terms with cos/sin powers using cot = cos / sin and csc² = 1+cot²).

• Candidate 2 is exactly  
   –2 cot(3x) – (4/3) cot³(3x) – (2/5) cot⁵(3x) + C.

Both candidates correspond to the same Fourier‐transform pair.

1.  Candidate 2 gives the (one–sided) Fourier transform  
   Q(k)=2π[(1+ik)e^{-ik}-1]/k².

   •  Re Q(k)=2π( cos k+k sin k−1 )/k²  
   •  Im Q(k)=2π( −sin k+k cos k )/k².

2.  Using the standard inversion formula  

      q(x)= (1/π)∫₀^∞[Re Q(α) cos αx − Im Q(α) sin αx] dα,

   the integrand becomes  

      (1/π)[Re Q cos αx − Im Q sin αx]  
     =2[(α sin α+cos α−1) cos αx + (sin α−α cos α) sin αx]/α²,

   which is exactly the integrand written in Candidate 1 (they have absorbed the 1/π outside into the 2 inside, so the overall factor is the same).

Hence Candidate 1 is simply the inverse‐transform (Fourier‐integral) expression of the transform given in Candidate 2; they describe the same Fourier integral for q(x).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two integrands have exactly the same trigonometric/numerator structure, but they differ by a constant overall factor:

• Candidate 1 coefficient in front of the bracket = 2  
• Candidate 2 coefficient in front of the bracket = 4 / π ≈ 1.273

Since both integrals run over the same variable and interval (0 → ∞) with no other compensating differences, this constant factor means the two expressions cannot be identical representations of the same Fourier integral.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2:  
(2x/5)(3 sin(3 ln(2x)) + cos(3 ln(2x)))

Every non-constant term in Candidate 1 is exactly 3/2 times the corresponding term in Candidate 2.  
Hence

Candidate 1 = (3/2)·Candidate 2 + constant.

• Constant term:  
  – Candidate 1: 16 π² / 9  
  – Candidate 2:  8 π² / 9  

• Cosine coefficients:  
  – Candidate 1: 64 (−1)ⁿ / (3 n²)  
  – Candidate 2: 32 (−1)ⁿ / (3 n²)

All coefficients in Candidate 1 are exactly twice those in Candidate 2, so the series are not the same representation of the function. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the cosine coefficients as  

aₙ = 64 (−1)ⁿ / (3 n²).

Candidate 2 gives the cosine coefficients as  

aₙ = 32 π / (3 n) + 64 (−1)ⁿ / (3 n²),

which contains an extra term 32 π / (3 n) for every n.  
Since these coefficients are different (the extra term is not identically zero), the two Fourier series are not the same.

The two antiderivatives are not the same.

1. Candidate 1 contains an additional term  
   −3 arctan(2^{−5/6} x^{1/6}).  
   Candidate 2 has no arctan–type term.  Because the derivative of arctan(2^{−5/6} x^{1/6}) is not a constant, this difference cannot be absorbed into the integration constant.

2. The coefficients in front of the logarithm differ:  
   • Candidate 1: 36 ln(4 + 2^{1/3} x^{1/3})  
   • Candidate 2: 33 ln(4 + 2^{1/3} x^{1/3})  
   A discrepancy in the coefficient likewise produces a non-constant difference in derivatives.

Since these expressions differ by more than an additive constant, the two candidates are inequivalent.

Both candidates give the antiderivative in the form  

(3/4)·2^{2/3}·x^{2/3}  –  9·2^{1/3}·x^{1/3}  +  36 ln(4+2^{1/3}x^{1/3})  –  3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2^{5/6})  +  C,

only differing by trivial rearrangement of factors:
• the powers of 2 and x are identical after expanding (2x)^{k} = 2^{k}x^{k};  
• ln(4+2^{1/3}x^{1/3}) = ln(2^{1/3}x^{1/3}+4) (same argument, just reordered);  
• arctan(x^{1/6}/2^{5/6}) matches in both;  
• both include the same additive constant C.

Hence the two expressions differ at most by an overall constant and are mathematically the same antiderivative.

Both candidates give two quantities: length and height.

Length:
• Candidate 1: 96 ft
• Candidate 2: 96 ft
→ identical.

Height:
• Candidate 1: approximately 26.53 ft
• Candidate 2: 8√11 ft ≈ 26.5330 ft

Expressing both to 6 significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 26.5300
• Candidate 2: 26.5330

The values differ at the 5th significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not the same.

Since one of the required sub-answers differs, the overall answers are not equivalent.
Candidate 1:
• Length = 96 ft  
• Height ≈ 26.53 ft  → interpreted to 6 significant digits as 26.5300

Candidate 2:
• Length = 96 ft  
• Height = 8√11 ft = 26.532998… ft → to 6 significant digits: 26.5330

Comparing each required answer:
1. Lengths match exactly (96 ft).
2. Heights: 26.5300 vs 26.5330 differ in the 4th decimal place; they are not identical to 6 significant digits, so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for three specific numerical scores—one for each player—and both candidates provide exactly three corresponding numbers in the same order:

• Player 1: 500 in both  
• Player 2: –250 in both  
• Player 3: 350 in both  

Units (points) are implicitly the same; the dollar sign in Candidate 1 does not change the numerical value. Hence every sub-answer matches.

Both candidates are single definite-integral expressions intended to produce the area common to the two polar curves.

1.  Candidate 1:  A₁ = 9 ∫₀^{π/4} sin²θ dθ
2.  Candidate 2:  A₂ = ½∫₀^{π/4}(3 sin θ)² dθ + ½∫_{π/4}^{π/2}(3 cos θ)² dθ
                  = (9/2)[∫₀^{π/4}sin²θ dθ + ∫_{π/4}^{π/2}cos²θ dθ]

Evaluate the elementary integrals:

∫₀^{π/4}sin²θ dθ = π/8 – 1/4  
∫_{π/4}^{π/2}cos²θ dθ = π/8 – 1/4

Thus
A₂ = (9/2)[(π/8 – 1/4) + (π/8 – 1/4)] = (9/2)(π/4 – 1/2) = 9π/8 – 9/4.

Candidate 1 gives
A₁ = 9(π/8 – 1/4) = 9π/8 – 9/4.

Since A₁ = A₂ exactly, the two expressions yield the same numerical result and therefore represent the same region’s area. Under Rule 8 (mathematical equivalence) and Rule 4 (same real value), the answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the single integral  

 9 ∫₀^{π/4} sin²θ dθ.

Candidate 2 gives the sum of two integrals  

 (1/2)∫₀^{π/4}(3 sin θ)²dθ + (1/2)∫_{π/4}^{π/2}(3 cos θ)²dθ  
 = (9/2)∫₀^{π/4} sin²θ dθ + (9/2)∫_{π/4}^{π/2} cos²θ dθ.

Thus Candidate 2 has a different coefficient (9/2 instead of 9) for the first integral and adds an additional integral over [π/4, π/2]. Hence the two expressions are not the same.

Candidate 2:  [4(ln x + 1) − 3y/x] / [3(2 + ln x)]

Multiplying numerator and denominator of Candidate 2 by x yields

The two candidates give the same polar-orbit equation.

• Candidate 1 writes the numerator directly as 1.16450334.  
• Candidate 2 writes it in factored form 17.94 (1 – 0.967²).  
  17.94 (1 – 0.967²) = 17.94 (1 – 0.935089)  
           = 17.94 (0.064911)  
           ≈ 1.16450334.

Thus both equations reduce to
 r = 1.16450334 / (1 + 0.967 cos θ),

differing only in the symbol used for the angle (t vs θ). Hence the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 
κ₁(t) = 1 / [16·|sin(t/2)|]

Candidate 2 gives 
κ₂(t) = 1 / [16·sin(t/2)]

These formulas differ by the presence of the absolute-value bars. When sin(t/2) is negative, κ₂(t) becomes negative, whereas κ₁(t) remains positive. Therefore the two expressions are not mathematically identical.

The two candidates differ:  

• Candidate 1 places an absolute-value bar around sin(t/2), giving 1 / [16 |sin(t/2)|].  
• Candidate 2 uses 1 / [16 sin(t/2)] with no absolute value.

Because curvature must be non-negative and the absence/presence of the absolute value changes the sign whenever sin(t/2) is negative, the formulas are not mathematically identical.

Both candidates give an antiderivative expressed in different forms.  
After rewriting Candidate 2 in terms of t = tan(4x):

csc 8x cot 8x = (1 – t⁴)/(4t²)  
csc³ 8x cot 8x = (1 + t²)³(1 – t²)/(16t⁴)

Plugging these into Candidate 2 and simplifying,

- (csc³ 8x cot 8x)/32 – (3 csc 8x cot 8x)/64 + (3/64)ln|t|
= 1/512 t⁴ + 1/64 t² – 1/64 t⁻² – 1/512 t⁻⁴ + (3/64)ln|t| + C.

Candidate 1 simplifies directly to exactly the same expression:

1/512 t⁴ + 1/64 t² – 1/64 t⁻² – 1/512 t⁻⁴ + (3/64)ln|t| + C.

Since both antiderivatives differ (at most) by an additive constant, the two answers are mathematically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates provide antiderivatives of the integrand \( \csc ^5(8x)=1/\sin ^5(8x)\).

1.  Differentiating Candidate 1:
    •  After substituting \(t=\tan(4x)\) and simplifying, one obtains  
       \(F_1'(x)=\dfrac1{32\,\sin ^5(4x)\cos ^5(4x)}=\csc ^5(8x)\).

2.  Candidate 2 is the standard textbook antiderivative for \(\csc ^5\); a direct differentiation (using  
   \( (\csc y)'=-\csc y\cot y\) and \((\cot y)'=-\csc ^2 y\) with \(y=8x\)) gives the same derivative \(\csc ^5(8x)\).

Because both candidates differentiate to the identical integrand, their difference has zero derivative, hence is a constant. Therefore the two expressions are equivalent up to an additive constant, which is exactly what an indefinite integral requires.

The two candidates give matching answers for parts 1–4, and their interval endpoints largely coincide.  
However, they differ in the exact intervals stated for monotonicity and concavity:

• Decreasing intervals:  
 Candidate 1 excludes x = 0, while Candidate 2 includes it (–2/√3 < x < 0 and 0 < x < 2/√3 vs. –2/√3 < x < 2/√3).  
 Hence the two sets are not identical.

• Concave-up intervals:  
 Candidate 1 gives (2/√3, ∞); Candidate 2 splits this and excludes x = 2.  
 The interval sets therefore differ at x = 2.

• Concave-down intervals:  
 Candidate 1’s interval (–∞, –2/√3) includes x = –2, whereas Candidate 2 separates at –2 and excludes it.

Because these interval sets are not exactly the same, the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of the integrand.

Rewrite Candidate 1 (ignoring the arbitrary constant):
-(1/9)·(1 + 3/x²)^{3/2}

Notice
(1 + 3/x²)^{3/2} = [(x² + 3)/x²]^{3/2} = (x² + 3)^{3/2} / (x²)^{3/2} = (x² + 3)^{3/2}/x³ .

Hence Candidate 1 becomes
-(1/9)·(x² + 3)^{3/2}/x³ ,

which is exactly Candidate 2 (again up to the arbitrary constant).

Therefore the two answers are mathematically identical (they differ only by the constant of integration).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>

Re-expressing Candidate 1 gives

For x > 0, |x| = x, so they coincide; but for x < 0, |x| = −x, making Candidate 1 equal to +(1/9)(3+x²)^{3/2}/x³, which is not the same as Candidate 2.  
Since their difference is not a constant over the whole domain, the two antiderivatives are not equivalent.

Both candidates provide an antiderivative expressed in terms of cot(7x).  
Rewrite Candidate 1:

F₁(x) = −(3/7)[(1/5)cot⁵(7x) + cot(7x) − (1/3)cot³(7x) − arctan(cot(7x))] + C  
       = −(3/35)cot⁵(7x) + (1/7)cot³(7x) − (3/7)cot(7x) + (3/7)arctan(cot(7x)) + C.

But d/dx[arctan(cot(7x))] = −7, hence

(3/7)arctan(cot(7x)) = −3x + constant.

Absorbing this constant into C gives

F₁(x) = −(3/35)cot⁵(7x) + (1/7)cot³(7x) − (3/7)cot(7x) − 3x + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2. Therefore the two antiderivatives differ at most by an overall constant.

Both answers are antiderivatives of the same integrand.  
Subtracting Candidate 2 from Candidate 1,

F₁(x) − F₂(x)
 = [(x−15)√((x+3)/(x−3)) + 12√((x+3)/(x−3)) − √(x²−9)]
   − 9 ln | (√(x−3)−√(x+3)) / (√(x−3)+√(x+3))| − 9 ln |x+√(x²−9)|

The algebraic terms simplify to √(x²−9) − √(x²−9) = 0, leaving

F₁(x) − F₂(x)
 = −9 ln ( |(√(x−3)−√(x+3))/(√(x−3)+√(x+3))| · |x+√(x²−9)| ).

For x > 3 this product equals the constant 3, hence

F₁(x) − F₂(x) = −9 ln 3,

a constant independent of x. Since antiderivatives differing only by a constant are equivalent, the two candidates represent the same result.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives can differ only by an additive constant.  
Write  

F₁ = √((x+3)/(x-3))·(x-15) − 9 ln| (√(x-3) − √(x+3))/(√(x-3) + √(x+3)) | + C₁  
F₂ = √((x+3)/(x-3))·(x-3) − 12 √((x+3)/(x-3)) − 21 ln| ( √((x+3)/(x-3)) − 1 ) / ( √((x+3)/(x-3)) + 1 ) | + C₂

Let t = √((x+3)/(x-3)).  Using t = √(x+3)/√(x-3), the log arguments satisfy  

(√(x-3) − √(x+3))/(√(x-3) + √(x+3)) = −(t−1)/(t+1),

whose absolute value is identical to |(t−1)/(t+1)|.  Hence both logs have the same argument; only their coefficients differ.

Compute F₂ − F₁ (ignoring the constant C₂−C₁):

• Algebraic √–terms cancel to 0.  
• Log term: −21 ln(...) − (−9 ln(...)) = −12 ln(...).

Therefore F₂ − F₁ = −12 ln(...) + constant, which still depends on x (since ln(...) varies with x).  Because the difference is not a constant, the two antiderivatives are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both expressions are antiderivatives of the same integrand and they differ only by an additive constant:

• After rewriting both results with the substitutions  
 u = √(x+3), v = √(x−3), so √((x+3)/(x−3)) = u/v, √(x²−9) = uv,

 Candidate 1 becomes uv − 12 u/v − 9 ln|(v−u)/(v+u)| + C₁  
 Candidate 2 becomes uv − 12 u/v − 9 ln|x − uv| + C₂.

• Using algebraic identities one finds  
 ln|(v−u)/(v+u)| = ln|x − uv| − ln 3,

 so the logarithmic part of Candidate 1 equals the logarithmic part of Candidate 2 plus the constant 9 ln 3.

Hence Candidate 1 = Candidate 2 + (9 ln 3), i.e. the two antiderivatives differ only by an overall constant.

According to the rules, two indefinite-integral answers that differ only by a constant are equivalent.

Both candidates can be rewritten in terms of

    = ab − 12 s − 9 ln|a − b| + 9 ln|a + b| + C₁.

Candidate 2:
I₂ = ab − 12 s + 18 ln|a + b| + C₂.

Difference:
I₂ − I₁ = 18 ln|a + b| − (−9 ln|a − b| + 9 ln|a + b|) + (C₂ − C₁)
         = 9 [ln|a + b| + ln|a − b|] + constant
         = 9 ln|(a + b)(a − b)| + constant
         = 9 ln|a² − b²| + constant
         = 9 ln|x − 3 − (x + 3)| + constant
         = 9 ln|−6| + constant
         = constant.

Since I₂ − I₁ is a constant (independent of x), the two antiderivatives differ only by an overall additive constant and are therefore mathematically equivalent.

The two candidates give different numerical values:

• Candidate 1: 127 (books) → 127.000 to six significant digits  
• Candidate 2: 126.58 (books) → 126.580 to six significant digits  

Since 127.000 ≠ 126.580, the answers are not the same.

127.000 vs 126.580 — they differ at the third significant digit. Thus they are not equal according to Rule 4.

= π/12 + √3/2 + π/4 − 3/2
= (π/12 + 3π/12) + √3/2 − 3/2
= π/3 + √3/2 − 3/2.

Candidate 2:

= π/3 + √3/2 − 3/2.

Candidate 1 gives a Fourier-integral representation (an integral over α).  
Candidate 2 gives a closed-form piecewise expression, not an integral, and in fact equals πx on (0,1) but gives π/2 at x = 1, so it is not even the same function at that point. Therefore the two answers describe different functions and are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: 110 π mph  ≈ 110 × 3.141592653589793 = 345.575191894877 mph

Comparing the two numbers to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 → 345.575  
• Candidate 2 → 345.575  

They match to 6 significant digits and use the same unit (mph). Hence, the two answers are equivalent.

The two candidates yield antiderivatives that coincide for x > 0, but for x < 0 they differ by a factor −1 (i.e., Candidate 1 = − Candidate 2).  
Because this difference is not a constant (it changes sign depending on x), the two answers are not equivalent antiderivatives of the integrand over the whole domain (x ≠ 0).
The two antiderivative formulas are not equivalent.

A quick parity check suffices:

• Candidate 1 depends only on x through x² (via 1/x² and √(1+1/x²)), so it is an even function of x.

• Candidate 2 contains a factor 1/x⁵, making it an odd function of x (the numerator is even, the denominator is odd).

Since an even function cannot differ from an odd function merely by an additive constant, the two expressions cannot represent the same antiderivative on the whole domain. A numerical test confirms this: at x = 1 both give ≈ –0.1886, but at x = –1 they give opposite signs.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions can be rewritten in comparable form:

Candidate 1  
F₁(x)= (1/3)(1+x²)^{3/2}/|x|³ − (1/5)(1+x²)^{5/2}/|x|⁵  
   = (1+x²)^{3/2}(2x²−3)/(15 |x|⁵)

Candidate 2  
F₂(x)= (1+x²)^{3/2}(2x²−3)/(15 x⁵)

Hence  
F₂(x) = F₁(x) · (|x|⁵ / x⁵) = F₁(x)·sign(x).

So for x>0, F₁ = F₂, but for x<0, F₂ = −F₁; the two antiderivatives differ by more than an additive constant on the negative-x interval. Therefore they are not equivalent overall.

Candidate 2 supplies two points: (1/2, 1, 45/4) and (47/24, 47/12, 235/24).

(2/25)·[(2/3) tan^(3/2)(10x) + (2/7) tan^(7/2)(10x)] + C
expands to

(2/25)(2/3) tan^(3/2)(10x) + (2/25)(2/7) tan^(7/2)(10x) + C
= 4/75 tan^(3/2)(10x) + 4/175 tan^(7/2)(10x) + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2’s result (up to the arbitrary constant of integration). Therefore, the two answers are mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1 says the local-minimum values are 17 and 89 and the local-maximum value is 1079/12 (≈ 89.9167).  
Candidate 2 simply lists the three values 17, 89, and 1079/12.

Both candidates therefore give exactly the same set of numerical extremum values. Candidate 1 supplies additional (x-coordinate) information, but that does not contradict anything in Candidate 2. Since the core numerical answers coincide, the two predictions are equivalent.

The two antiderivatives coincide for x > 0, because |x|=x there, but differ for x < 0.

• Candidate 1 contains √(5x²−2x+1)/|x|, whereas Candidate 2 has √(5x²−2x+1)/x.  
  For negative x these differ by a sign, so the first terms of the two antiderivatives differ by 2 · (8/7) √(5x²−2x+1)/x, which is not a constant.

• Inside the logarithm, Candidate 1 has  
 |1/x − 1 + √(5x²−2x+1)/|x|| = |(1 − x − √(5x²−2x+1))/x| for x<0,  
  while Candidate 2 uses |(1 − x + √(5x²−2x+1))/x|.  
  These two arguments are not equal (nor reciprocals) for negative x, so the log pieces do not cancel the earlier sign difference.

Consequently, the difference between the two expressions is not a constant over the whole domain; therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives differ by

F₁ − F₂  
= ½ ln([(√(25+x²)−5)(√(25+x²)+5)]) − ln x  
= ½ ln(x²) − ln x  
= ln|x| − ln x.

For x > 0 (the natural domain usually taken for the integrand, since it contains the factor 1/x), ln|x| = ln x, so the difference is 0.  
If one formally extends to x < 0, ln x is not defined, but any discrepancy can be absorbed into the additive integration constant C.

Thus the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives; they differ at most by an (allowable) constant.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give an antiderivative of the form

(1/5) √(25+x²) + (1/2) ln|(√(25+x²) – 5)/(√(25+x²)+5)| + C.

Candidate 1 has the same two terms (just written in a different order) and includes an absolute-value symbol, but the ratio inside is already non-negative for every x where the integrand is defined, so the absolute value does not change the expression up to an additive constant. Hence the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by a constant of integration and are therefore mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1 states that the only critical point is (0,0) but that the second-derivative test is inconclusive there, so it gives no classification (neither max, min, nor saddle).

Candidate 2 states that the only critical point is (0,0) and classifies it explicitly as a saddle point.

Since one candidate leaves the classification undecided and the other classifies it as a saddle point, the two answers are not the same.

 1 – ½(x–1)² – ⅛(x–1)⁴ – ¹⁄₁₆(x–1)⁶ – ⋯

and does not specify the general coefficient for the rest of the series.  
Because Candidate 2’s “…” leaves the subsequent coefficients unspecified, we cannot be sure they match the coefficients determined by Candidate 1. Hence the two answers are not provably the same series and are considered inequivalent.

The two expressions differ by  
arctan(tan x) – x.

This difference is not a constant function; it varies with x (e.g., it is 0 at x = 0 but ≈ 0.1 at x = π/2 – 0.1). Since antiderivatives are equivalent only if they differ by an additive constant everywhere on the domain, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give infinite families of solutions parameterized by an integer.

Candidate 1:
t = (–1)^{n+1} · π/6 + nπ,  n ∈ ℤ
Split the cases:
 • n even (n = 2k):  t = –π/6 + 2kπ.
 • n odd  (n = 2k+1):  t =  π/6 + (2k+1)π = 7π/6 + 2kπ.

Note that –π/6 + 2kπ = 11π/6 + 2(k–1)π, so the two residue classes modulo 2π are
   7π/6 + 2πk  and  11π/6 + 2πk.

Candidate 2 explicitly lists exactly those two classes:
t = 7π/6 + 2πk  and  t = 11π/6 + 2πk,  k ∈ ℤ.

Thus the two candidates describe the same set of t-values. No unit mismatch or missing solutions exist, merely different but equivalent parameterizations.

  – Candidate 2: (−∞, −6) ∪ (−2, ∞)  
  These are not the same (Candidate 1 excludes x = 0, Candidate 2 includes the entire open interval (−2, ∞)).

Because at least one sub-answer is different, the two overall responses are not equivalent.
Both candidates supply answers for all nine sub-parts, so we must compare each entry.

Items 1–8: the answers are identical (allowing the obvious typo “–1·∞” = “–∞” in Candidate 1).

Item 9 (Point of inflection):
• Candidate 1: (0, 0)  
• Candidate 2: x = 0   (no y-coordinate)

A “point” requires both coordinates; Candidate 2 gives only the x-value. Therefore the two candidates’ answers differ for sub-problem 9.

Since at least one sub-answer is not the same, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give answers for both required quantities, y′ and y″.

1. y′:
   • Candidate 1: (x + 3y)/(2y − 3x)  
   • Candidate 2: −(x + 3y)/(3x − 2y)

   Note that 2y − 3x = −(3x − 2y).  
   Therefore (x + 3y)/(2y − 3x) = −(x + 3y)/(3x − 2y).  
   Hence the two y′ expressions are identical.

2. y″:
   • Candidate 1: 11(x² + 6xy − 2y²)/(3x − 2y)³  
     Using the defining equation x² + 6xy − 2y² = 3, this equals 11·3/(3x − 2y)³ = 33/(3x − 2y)³.
   • Candidate 2: 33/(3x − 2y)³

   Thus the two y″ expressions are also identical.

Because both sub-answers match, the candidates are equivalent according to Rule 2 (all required answers present and the same) and Rule 8 (algebraic equivalence).

The two expressions coincide in their logarithmic terms, but differ in the coefficient multiplying the arctan–term:

• Candidate 1:  − √3 · arctan( … )  
• Candidate 2:  − (1/√3) · arctan( … )

Since the argument of the arctan is identical and depends on x, a change of the multiplicative factor cannot be absorbed into an additive constant; the two antiderivatives therefore differ by a non-constant function of x.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 differ in the coefficient multiplying the arctan-term:

• Candidate 1:  −√3 · arctan((2 tan^{2/3}(x/2) − 1)/√3)

• Candidate 2:  + (1/√3) · arctan((2 tan^{2/3}(x/2) − 1)/√3)

The coefficients −√3 and +1/√3 are not equal; their difference produces a variable-dependent term, not a constant. Since two antiderivatives can differ only by an additive constant to be equivalent, these two results are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the expression

(1/4) ln( … ) – (1/2) arctan x,

and they differ only in the logarithm’s argument:

• Candidate 1: ln(|x+1| / |x−1|)  
• Candidate 2: ln((1+x)/(1−x))

For the interval |x| < 1, which is precisely the radius of convergence of the original power series, 1+x > 0 and 1−x > 0, so the absolute–value bars in Candidate 1 are superfluous:  
|x+1| = 1+x and |x−1| = 1−x.  
Hence on the domain where the series sum is meant to be valid the two formulas coincide exactly.

Therefore the two candidates are mathematically equivalent answers to the question.
The two candidates give

Candidate 1:  (1/4) ln(|x+1| / |x−1|) − (1/2) arctan x  
Candidate 2:  (1/4) ln((1+x)/(1−x)) − (1/2) arctan x  

The only discrepancy is the presence of absolute-value bars in the logarithm of Candidate 1.  
For the real series in question the domain of convergence is |x|<1 (end-points excluded), and on this domain (1+x)/(1−x) is strictly positive, so |(1+x)/(1−x)| = (1+x)/(1−x). Hence both formulas yield identical real values throughout the domain where the series is defined.  
Thus the two expressions represent the same function for the purpose of the problem, making the answers equivalent.

Both candidates give an antiderivative of  
∫(x³+3) cos(2x) dx.

Rewrite Candidate 1:

I₁ = 1/256 [128 x³ sin 2x + 384 sin 2x − 192 x sin 2x  
             + 192 x² cos 2x − 96 cos 2x] + constant

          + (3/4 x²) cos 2x − (3/8) cos 2x + constant.

Candidate 2 is

I₂ = (1/2 x³ − 3/4 x + 3/2) sin 2x + (3/4 x² − 3/8) cos 2x + C  
   = (1/2 x³) sin 2x − (3/4 x) sin 2x + (3/2) sin 2x  
          + (3/4 x²) cos 2x − (3/8) cos 2x + C.

The coefficients of every term match exactly; the only difference is the additive constant (“constant” vs. C), which is allowed for antiderivatives. Hence the two expressions represent the same set of antiderivatives.

The question asks to “identify the maxima and/or minima.”  In the usual context of single-variable calculus, this means giving the full coordinates (both x and y) of each extremum. 

• Candidate 1 supplies full points: maximum at (1, 2) and minimum at (–1, –2).  
• Candidate 2 gives only the x-coordinates: local maximum at x = 1 and local minimum at x = –1, omitting the corresponding y-values.

Because Candidate 2 leaves out information that Candidate 1 provides – and that the problem is reasonably interpreted as requiring – the two answers are not equivalent under Rule 2 (incomplete answer for all required components).
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 supplies full coordinate points for the extrema: maximum at (1, 2) and minimum at (-1, -2).  
Candidate 2 gives only the x-coordinates: local maximum at x = 1 and local minimum at x = -1, omitting the corresponding y-values.

Because the question asks to “identify the maxima and/or minima,” which normally requires the actual extreme values of the function (i.e., both x and y coordinates), Candidate 2 lacks required information that Candidate 1 provides. According to Rule 2, an answer missing a required component is not equivalent to one that contains it.

Both candidates give the antiderivative  

−(3/8) ln( tan²(4x) + √(tan⁴(4x)+1) )  

up to an arbitrary additive constant.  The ordering of “C” and the logarithmic term in Candidate 1 (“C − …”) versus Candidate 2 (“− … + C”) is immaterial, since an unspecified constant can absorb any finite difference.  
The logarithm’s argument is identical in both answers (addition is commutative), so they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1’s antiderivative differentiates to  
- 3⁄4 · tan θ (1+tan² θ)/√(1+tan⁴ θ) with θ = 4x, which matches the given integrand after the factor dx = dθ/4 is accounted for.  

Candidate 2’s antiderivative differentiates to  
3⁄4 tan θ – 3⁄4 tan 2θ = – 3⁄4 tan θ (1+tan² θ)/(1–tan² θ),  
which is generally different from – 3⁄4 tan θ (1+tan² θ)/√(1+tan⁴ θ).  
The two expressions are equal only at isolated points (e.g., tan θ = 0), not identically, so Candidate 2 is not the same antiderivative up to a constant.

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates give the modulus  
|z| = √10.

They differ only in the way they write the argument θ:

• Candidate 1: θ₁ = arccos(−3/√10).

• Candidate 2: θ₂ = π − arctan(1/3).

For the point z = −3 + i (x < 0, y > 0), the true polar angle is in quadrant II and satisfies

cos θ = x/|z| = −3/√10  
sin θ = y/|z| = 1/√10.

arccos(−3/√10) returns the unique angle in [0, π] whose cosine is −3/√10 and whose sine is positive—exactly the required quadrant-II angle.

Also, for the same quadrant-II point,
θ = π − arctan(|y/x|) = π − arctan(1/3).

Hence  
θ₁ = θ₂ (numerically ≈ 2.819842099 rad).

Since both candidates use the same modulus √10 and the same angle (just written differently), the two trigonometric forms are mathematically identical.

The two antiderivatives can be rewritten with the same functions:

Candidate 1: F₁(x)=2 sec x + (1/3) sec³x + cos x + C  
Candidate 2: F₂(x)=−2 sec x + (1/3) sec³x − cos x + C

Comparing term by term:

• (1/3) sec³x appears with the same sign in both.  
• The sec x term has opposite signs (+2 versus −2).  
• The cos x term has opposite signs (+cos x versus −cos x).

Thus F₁(x)−F₂(x)=4 sec x+2 cos x, which is not a constant (its derivative is 4 sec x tan x−2 sin x ≠ 0 in general). Since two indefinite integrals must differ at most by an additive constant to be equivalent, the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: { x = πk/2 | k ∈ ℤ } ∪ { x = π/4 + πk/2 | k ∈ ℤ }
  • First branch gives all even multiples of π/4.  
  • Second branch gives all odd multiples of π/4.  
  Combining the two branches reproduces every integer multiple of π/4.

Therefore the two candidates are mathematically identical sets of solutions.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates look similar, but Candidate 2 explicitly states “n ∈ ℤ,” while Candidate 1 gives no indication of what kind of number n is.  
In trigonometric solution sets, specifying that n is an integer is essential; otherwise the answer is ambiguous and could be interpreted to allow any real (or other) values of n, yielding a different set of x. Because Candidate 1 omits this crucial condition, the two answers do not unambiguously represent the same set.

Both candidates give the general solution in the form “(integer) · π/4.”  
Candidate 1 writes  x = n π/4 (with n implied to be an integer in standard trigonometric‐solution notation), while Candidate 2 explicitly states x = (π/4) k, k ∈ ℤ.  The two describe the same set of angles, merely using different dummy symbols (n vs. k). Hence they are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give antiderivatives that differ by a multiplicative factor of –3, not merely by an additive constant:

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
 F₁(x) = (1/9)·(x³+3)^{1/3}/x + x²/[18·(x³+3)^{2/3}] + C  

Candidate 2 is  
 F₂(x) = –(x³+3)^{1/3}/(3x) – x²/[6·(x³+3)^{2/3}] + C  
    = –3·[(1/9)·(x³+3)^{1/3}/x + x²/[18·(x³+3)^{2/3}] ] + C  
    = –3·F₁(x)  (up to a constant).

Because multiplying an antiderivative by –3 changes its derivative by the same factor, F₂ does not represent the same antiderivative as F₁ except in the trivial case where the integrand itself is zero. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
Both candidates give the antiderivative

F(x)= (x³+2)/(6x(3+x³)^{2/3})  + C.

Candidate 1, after rewriting
    (1/9)√[3]{1+3/x³} + (1/18)(1+3/x³)^{-2/3},
is exactly (x³+2)/(6x(3+x³)^{2/3}); candidate 2 already presents it in that form.  
Hence the two results are the same up to an additive constant (in fact, they are identical).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give

Candidate 1: F₁(x)= 1/9 (1+3/x³)^{1/3} + 1/[18 (1+3/x³)^{2/3}]  
Candidate 2: F₂(x)= (x³+2)/[6x (3+x³)^{2/3}]

Rewrite F₁ in terms of x:

1 + 3/x³ = (x³+3)/x³  

⇒ (1+3/x³)^{1/3} = (x³+3)^{1/3}/x  
   (1+3/x³)^{-2/3} = x²/(x³+3)^{2/3}

Hence
F₁ = (1/9)(x³+3)^{1/3}/x + (1/18)x²/(x³+3)^{2/3}

Put both terms over the common denominator 6x (x³+3)^{2/3}:

First term: (2/3)(x³+3)/[6x (x³+3)^{2/3}]  
Second term: (1/3)x³/[6x (x³+3)^{2/3}]

Adding numerators: (2/3)(x³+3) + (1/3)x³ = x³+2.

Thus
F₁ = (x³+2)/[6x (x³+3)^{2/3}] = F₂.

Since both antiderivatives differ at most by a constant (actually they are identical), the two candidates are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates express the antiderivative in different but algebraically equivalent forms.

Let  
t = 1 + 3/x³ = (x³ + 3)/x³.

Candidate 1:  
F₁(x) = 1/9 · t^{1/3} + 1/18 · t^{-2/3}  
       = (2 t^{1/3} + t^{-2/3})/18  
       = (2 t t^{-2/3} + t^{-2/3})/18  
       = (1 + 2 t) t^{-2/3}/18.

Candidate 2:  
F₂(x) = (x³ + 2)/(6x(x³ + 3)^{2/3})  
       → after substituting t and simplifying → (1 + 2 t) t^{-2/3}/18.

Since F₁(x) = F₂(x) (they differ only by the arbitrary constant of integration), the two answers are equivalent.

• 0  
• 4√6/9 ≈ 1.088

Candidate 2:

Difference (Cand 1 − Cand 2):
3 ln(4 + x^{1/3}) − 3 arctan(½ x^{1/6})

This expression depends on x (its derivative is non-zero), so it is not a constant. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the antiderivative as a linear combination of the same five elementary functions, with identical coefficients:

1. −15 x^{1/3}
2. +(3/2) x^{2/3}
3. +60 ln(4 + x^{1/3})   (candidate 1 writes ln|4 + x^{1/3}|; this differs only by an overall constant on domains where 4 + x^{1/3} might become negative, which is absorbed in the arbitrary constant C)
4. −3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2)
5. +C (arbitrary integration constant)

Because the absolute-value difference in the logarithm can be absorbed into the constant of integration, the two expressions differ at most by a constant and hence represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Both candidates give the antiderivative

(3/2) x^{2/3}  – 15 x^{1/3}  + 60 ln(4+ x^{1/3})  – 3 arctan(x^{1/6}/2)  + constant,

just written in slightly different order and with |4+…| instead of (4+…) in the logarithm.  
Because the integral’s natural real domain is x > 0 (due to the sixth root and the factor 1/x), 4 + x^{1/3} is strictly positive, so the absolute-value bars make no difference. All coefficients and functional forms match exactly, and each contains an arbitrary constant.

Candidate 1 lists two separate families of solutions (obtained by swapping the roles of x and y):

• Family B:  x = π/6 + π/2 (2n + k) ,  y = π/3 + π/2 (k − 2n)

with n, k ∈ ℤ.

Candidate 2 gives only one family:

• x = π/3 + kπ/2 ,  y = π/6 + kπ/2 , k ∈ ℤ.

This corresponds to Family A with n = 0, but it never produces the solutions of Family B (for example, the pair x = π/6, y = π/3 is absent from Candidate 2). Hence Candidate 2 is a strict subset of Candidate 1 and the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 list different sets of (x, y) pairs.  
Example: taking n = 0, k = 1 in Candidate 1 (first pair) gives

This pair satisfies the original equations, appears in Candidate 1, but is not of the form  
 (π/6 + nπ, π/3 + nπ) or (π/3 + nπ, π/6 + nπ)

whereas Candidate 2 gives (ln b/ln a) · ln|x| + C, which is valid for both x > 0 and x < 0 (x ≠ 0).  

Because the problem does not restrict x to be positive, the absolute-value sign is essential. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ in their treatment of negative \(x\).

• Candidate 1: \(\dfrac{\ln(x)\,\ln(b)}{\ln(a)}+C\) is undefined for \(x<0\).

• Candidate 2: \(\log_a(b)\,\ln|x|+C = \dfrac{\ln(b)}{\ln(a)}\,\ln|x|+C\) is defined for both \(x>0\) and \(x<0\) (excluding \(x=0\)).

Because the original problem only excludes \(x=0\) but does not forbid negative \(x\), Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not equivalent on the entire allowed domain. Hence they are not equivalent answers.
The two antiderivatives differ in their domain of validity.  
• Candidate 1 gives (ln b / ln a) ln x + C, which is defined only for x > 0.  
• Candidate 2 gives (ln b / ln a) ln |x| + C, which is defined for both x > 0 and x < 0 (x ≠ 0).

Since the original problem merely states x ≠ 0 (it does not restrict x to be positive), Candidate 2 covers a larger domain than Candidate 1. Therefore the two answers are not fully equivalent.

Both candidates give the antiderivative as

  √((x+6)/(x−6))·(x−30)  −  18 ln|…|  +  C,

with the same first term and the same logarithmic coefficient (−18).  
The only apparent difference is the order of the terms inside the absolute‐value bars of the logarithm:

• Candidate 1: ln | (√(x−6) − √(x+6)) / (√(x−6) + √(x+6)) |  
• Candidate 2: ln | (√(x+6) − √(x−6)) / (√(x+6) + √(x−6)) |

Since (√(x+6) − √(x−6)) = −(√(x−6) − √(x+6)), the two arguments differ only by an overall sign, and the absolute value removes that sign: |−z| = |z|. Therefore the logarithmic terms are identical up to an additive constant, which is already absorbed in the arbitrary integration constant C.

Thus the two expressions represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two antiderivatives must differ at most by an additive constant to be equivalent.

1. Log-terms:  
   Candidate 1 uses  
   ln | (√(x−6) − √(x+6)) / (√(x−6) + √(x+6)) |.  
   Candidate 2 uses  
   ln | ( √((x+6)/(x−6)) − 1 ) / ( √((x+6)/(x−6)) + 1 ) |.  
   Setting s = √((x+6)/(x−6)) = √(x+6)/√(x−6), one finds  
   (√(x−6) − √(x+6))/(√(x−6) + √(x+6)) = (1 − s)/(1 + s),  
   whose absolute value equals |(s − 1)/(s + 1)|.  
   Hence the logarithmic pieces are identical (up to sign inside an absolute value, which changes nothing).

2. Algebraic (non-log) parts:  
   Candidate 1:  (x − 30) s  
   Candidate 2:  2(x − 18) s = (2x − 36) s  

   Their difference is (2x − 36 − (x − 30)) s = (x − 6) s, which is not a constant; its derivative is non-zero for general x. Therefore the two entire expressions differ by a non-constant term.

Since the difference is not merely an additive constant, the two answers are not equivalent.

For the logarithmic term, observe:

Candidate 1 uses  
 −18 ln |(b − a)/(b + a)| = −18 ln |(1 − t)/(1 + t)|

Since ln(1/A) = −ln A, this equals  

 +18 ln |(1 + t)/(1 − t)|

Candidate 2 uses  
 +18 ln | (t + 1)/(t − 1) |

But (t + 1)/(t − 1) differs from (1 + t)/(1 − t) only by an overall sign in the denominator, which is eliminated by the absolute value; hence

 |(t + 1)/(t − 1)| = |(1 + t)/(1 − t)|.

Therefore the logarithmic terms are identical, differing only by the sign flip that cancels through the logarithm identity. Any remaining constant difference is absorbed in the arbitrary integration constant C.

Thus the two antiderivatives represent the same family of functions.

Both candidates give antiderivatives of ∫sec³(5x) dx.

1.  Candidate 1 rewrites  
   sin(5x)/(10 cos²(5x)) = (1/10) tan(5x) sec(5x).

2.  The logarithmic terms satisfy the identity  
   sec θ + tan θ = tan(π/4 + θ/2).  
   Therefore  
   ln|tan((5/2)x + π/4)| = ln|sec(5x) + tan(5x)|.

Hence Candidate 1’s result can be rewritten as  
(1/10)[sec(5x) tan(5x) + ln|sec(5x) + tan(5x)|] + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2’s expression (up to an overall constant of integration).

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give an antiderivative of sec³(5x).  
Observe:

1. sin(5x) / (10 cos²(5x)) = (1/10) sec(5x) tan(5x)  
   (because sec = 1/cos and tan = sin/cos).

2. sec(5x) + tan(5x) = (1 + sin 5x)/cos 5x = tan(π/4 + 5x/2).  
   Therefore ln|sec(5x)+tan(5x)| = ln|tan(π/4 + (5/2)x)|.

Thus every term in Candidate 1 matches the corresponding term in Candidate 2 (up to the arbitrary constant of integration).

Hence the two antiderivatives differ, at most, by a constant and are mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates give two components—quotient and remainder—as required.

Quotient comparison:
• Candidate 1: 2·x² – 7·x + 1  
• Candidate 2: 2x² – 7x + 1  

These are identical polynomial expressions (dots are just multiplication symbols).

Remainder comparison:
• Candidate 1: –2  
• Candidate 2: –2  

Identical numbers.

No unit issues, no missing components. Hence the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 lists the local‐extrema points:
• minima at (0, 13) and (6, 85)  
• maximum at (4, 295/3)

So the corresponding local‐extreme values are 13, 85, 295/3.

Candidate 2 explicitly gives the three values
13, 85, 295/3.

Thus both candidates supply exactly the same set of extremum values required by the question. Candidate 1 merely adds the associated x‐coordinates, but that extra information doesn’t contradict Candidate 2. The essential results coincide.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The problem asks for the local minimum and local maximum values of the given function.

• Candidate 1 names the two local-minimum points P(0, 13) and P(6, 85), and the local-maximum point P(4, 295/3).  
  → Hence the local-extremum values are 13 (minimum), 85 (minimum), and 295/3 (maximum).

• Candidate 2 simply lists the three numbers 13, 85, 295/3.

Both candidates thus supply exactly the same three numerical extremum values; candidate 1 just gives extra coordinate information, but that does not contradict candidate 2. Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 supplies four partial derivatives: with respect to x, y, a, and b.  
Candidate 2 supplies only two partial derivatives: with respect to x and y.

Because the sets of answers are not the same—Candidate 2 omits the derivatives with respect to a and b that Candidate 1 includes—the two responses are not identical. Under Rule 2, when the question involves multiple derivatives and one candidate gives fewer results than the other, the answers are considered inequivalent.

       = Σ_{n=1}^{∞}  [ −2(−1)^{n} /(π n) ] sin(nπx/3)

Both candidates give a single explicit formula for d²y/dx².  
The denominators are identical: (−15 cos²t sin t)³.

Hence we must compare the numerators.

Candidate 1 numerator  
= −15 cos²t sin t·(324 sin3t − 486 sin³3t) − 54 sin²3t cos3t·(30 cos t − 45 cos³t)  
= −2430 cos²t sin t[2 sin3t − 3 sin³3t] − 810 sin²3t cos3t·cos t(2 − 3 cos²t).

Candidate 2 numerator  
= (−18/5)[(6 sin3t cos²3t − 3 sin³3t) cos²t sin t − sin²3t cos3t (2 cos t sin²t − cos³t)]  
= (−54/5) cos²t sin t[2 sin3t − 3 sin³3t] + (18/5) sin²3t cos3t·cos t(2 − 3 cos²t).

Comparing coefficients of the two independent factors:

• For cos²t sin t[2 sin3t − 3 sin³3t]  
  Candidate 1 coefficient: −2430  
  Candidate 2 coefficient: −54/5.

• For sin²3t cos3t cos t(2 − 3 cos²t)  
  Candidate 1 coefficient: −810  
  Candidate 2 coefficient: +18/5 (opposite sign).

The signs of the second coefficients are different, and the numerical factors are not the same multiple for both terms (one would require −2430/ (−54/5)=225, while the other gives −810/(+18/5)=−225).

Therefore the two expressions cannot be equal for general t. The answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical answer.

Candidate 1: 796.54166667  (no unit stated)  
Candidate 2: 796.541666… ft  (feet)

1. Numerical comparison (Rule 4):  
   • Express to 6 significant digits  
     – Candidate 1: 796.541  
     – Candidate 2: 796.541  
   They match.

2. Unit consideration (Rule 1):  
   The problem context uses feet (velocity in ft/s). Feet is therefore the natural and essentially the only sensible unit here. Candidate 1 omits the unit, but this does not create real ambiguity because the context fixes the unit. Thus the omission does not make the answer different.

The two answers therefore describe the same quantity.

The difference between the two antiderivatives is  

A₁ − A₂  
= [ −x + (1/12) sin 12x + (1/12) sin 6x − (1/36) sin 18x ]   
  − [ −x + (1/12) sin 12x + (1/9) sin³ 6x ]  
= (1/12) sin 6x − (1/9) sin³ 6x − (1/36) sin 18x.

Using the identity sin 3θ = 3 sin θ − 4 sin³ θ with θ = 6x gives  

sin 18x = 3 sin 6x − 4 sin³ 6x  
⇒ sin³ 6x = (3 sin 6x − sin 18x)/4.

Substituting:  

(1/9) sin³ 6x = (1/9)·(3 sin 6x − sin 18x)/4 = (3 sin 6x − sin 18x)/36.

Now

(1/12) sin 6x − (3 sin 6x − sin 18x)/36 − (1/36) sin 18x  
= (3 sin 6x)/36 − (3 sin 6x − sin 18x)/36 − (sin 18x)/36  
= 0.

Thus A₁ − A₂ is identically zero (a constant), so both candidates represent the same antiderivative up to an additive constant.

Both answers give antiderivatives for  

∫ 2·cot⁶(14x) dx.

Write t = cot(14x).

Candidate 1:
F₁ = C − 1/35 t⁵ + 1/21 t³ − 1/7 t + 1/7 arctan t.

Candidate 2:
F₂ = −1/35 t⁵ + 1/21 t³ − 1/7 t − 2x + C.

Difference:
F₁ − F₂ = 1/7 arctan t + 2x + (const).

Check if this difference is constant:

d/dx[1/7 arctan t + 2x]  
= (1/7)·1/(1+t²)·(−14 csc²(14x)) + 2  
= (1/7)(−14)(1) + 2  
= −2 + 2  
= 0.

Hence 1/7 arctan t + 2x is constant, so F₁ and F₂ differ only by an additive constant. Therefore the two candidates are equivalent antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates present antiderivatives.  
Rewrite Candidate 1:

C₁(x)=−(1/35) cot⁵(14x)+(1/21) cot³(14x)−(1/7) cot(14x)+(1/7) arctan(cot 14x)+C.

Candidate 2 is

C₂(x)=−(1/35) cot⁵(14x)+(1/21) cot³(14x)−(1/7) cot(14x)−2x+C.

Difference:

C₁(x)−C₂(x) = (1/7) arctan(cot 14x)+2x + constant.

Derivative of (1/7) arctan(cot 14x) is (1/7)(−14)/(1+cot²)·csc² = −2, so

d/dx[(1/7) arctan(cot 14x)+2x]=−2+2=0.

Hence that difference is a constant; the two antiderivatives differ only by a constant and are therefore equivalent.

The question asks for five numerical estimates.  
Both candidates provide five numbers, but we must compare each corresponding value to six significant digits (Rule 4).

Comparison (expressed to 6 significant digits):

1. Candidate 1: 2.78000 vs. Candidate 2: 2.77240  → different  
Since they already differ on the first value, the two answer sets are not identical; hence the candidates’ outputs are not equivalent.

4. 3.22500 vs 3.22300  → different  
5. –0.920000 vs –0.916000 → different

Candidate 1 gives                     T₁(x) = (1 + cos x)/(1 − cos x).

Candidate 2 gives                     T₂(x) = (1 + cos x)²/ sin²x.

Using sin²x = (1 − cos x)(1 + cos x),

          T₂(x) = (1 + cos x)² /[(1 − cos x)(1 + cos x)]
                = (1 + cos x)/(1 − cos x)   provided 1 + cos x ≠ 0
                = T₁(x)   except when 1 + cos x = 0.

The condition 1 + cos x = 0 occurs at x = π + 2kπ.  
At those x–values:

• T₁(x) = 0/2 = 0  (so T₁ is defined)  
• T₂(x) = 0/0      (so T₂ is undefined).

Hence the two expressions do not have the same value (indeed, T₂ is not even defined) at x = π + 2kπ, so they are not equivalent everywhere.  

Therefore the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the antiderivative

(1/2) cos³(2x) + (3/2) cos(2x) + (3/2) ln|tan x| + constant.

Candidate 1 writes the logarithmic term as
−(3/4) ln|(1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x−1)|.
Since
ln|(1+cos 2x)/(cos 2x−1)|
= ln|−cot²x|
= ln(cot²x)        (because cot²x ≥ 0)
= 2 ln|cot x|
= −2 ln|tan x|,

multiplying by −(3/4) gives +(3/2) ln|tan x|, exactly the same as Candidate 2.

All the algebraic terms also match, so the two answers differ only by an overall constant of integration. Therefore they are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 simplifies to  
F₁(x) = ½ cos³(2x) + 3/2 cos(2x) + (3/2) ln|tan x| + C₁
   (because the log term can be rewritten with the identity  
   ln|(1+cos2x)/(cos2x−1)| = 2 ln|cot x| = −2 ln|tan x|).

Candidate 2 is  
F₂(x) = 3/2 cos³(2x) + 9/2 cos(2x) + 9/2 ln|tan x| + C₂.

Compute the difference of the variable parts:

F₂(x) − F₁(x) = (3/2−½) cos³(2x) + (9/2−3/2) cos(2x) + (9/2−3/2) ln|tan x|
               = cos³(2x) + 3 cos(2x) + 3 ln|tan x|,

which is clearly not a constant (its derivative is not zero).  
Therefore the two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant.

Since |√x − 1| = 1 − √x on the interval 0 ≤ x < 1 (the natural domain where the series converges), the two logarithmic terms coincide there. The remaining terms are identical. Hence, within the intended domain of the series, the two answers are the same.

Because items 6 and 9 differ (and 9 is incomplete), the two candidate answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for the points (a set of solutions) satisfying the equation.  
Both candidates list exactly the same two points, merely in opposite order:

• Candidate 1:  (2, –1) and (2, 1)  
• Candidate 2:  (2, 1) and (2, –1)

Since order is irrelevant for a set of solutions and the lists contain identical elements, the two answers are equivalent.

The numerical value of Candidate 1 is  
2 / (0.7)³ · (0.3)⁴ / 4! = 0.00196793 (to six significant digits).

Candidate 2 states 0.00197, which corresponds to 0.00197000 when written with six significant digits.

Comparing to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.00196793  
• Candidate 2: 0.00197000  

They differ at the third significant digit (6 ≠ 7), so the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give antiderivatives whose derivatives equal the integrand \(4\cos^4(4x)\).  
Because the difference of two antiderivatives has zero derivative, it can differ only by an additive constant. Hence the two expressions are mathematically the same up to an arbitrary constant of integration.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives whose derivatives equal  
4 cos⁴(4x), and the two expressions differ only by an overall constant (their non-constant parts cancel out). Hence they represent the same indefinite integral.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give antiderivatives whose derivatives equal the integrand  
2 tan⁴(10x).  

Moreover, their difference is  
(1/5) arctan(tan 10x) – 2x,  
whose derivative is zero (except at the jump points of arctan), so the two expressions differ only by an additive constant. Hence they represent the same family of antiderivatives.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Reasoning:

Candidate 1 gives
F₁(x)=1/15·tan³(10x)+1/5·arctan(tan(10x))−1/5·tan(10x)+C.

Candidate 2 gives
F₂(x)=1/15·tan³(10x)−1/5·tan(10x)+2x+C.

Difference:
F₁(x)−F₂(x)= (1/5)·arctan(tan(10x)) − 2x.

Using the identity arctan(tan θ)=θ−kπ (k changes by integers when θ crosses odd multiples of π/2), we have
F₁(x)−F₂(x)= −kπ/5,
which is not a single constant over all x but a piece-wise constant that jumps by π/5 whenever 10x crosses ±π/2, ±3π/2, … .

Therefore the two antiderivatives are not related by one universal additive constant, so the candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both expressions differentiate to the same integrand 2 tan⁴(10 x):

• Candidate 1  
  F₁(x)= (1/5)[(1/3)tan³(10x)+arctan(tan(10x))−tan(10x)]

 F₁′(x)=2 tan⁴(10 x)

• Candidate 2  
  F₂(x)= (1/15)tan³(10x) − (1/5)tan(10x) + 2x

 F₂′(x)=2 tan⁴(10 x)

The difference F₁−F₂ = (1/5)[arctan(tan(10x))−10x] is piece-wise constant; on any interval where tan(10x) is continuous (the natural domain for the integral) it equals a constant multiple of π, hence just an additive constant. Therefore the two antiderivatives are equivalent up to an overall constant, satisfying the usual criterion for equality of indefinite integrals.

After simplifying Candidate 1’s antiderivative we obtain  

F₁(x)=−7[ ¾ ln|tan x| + ½ sec 2x + 1/16 sec² 2x − 1/16 csc² 2x ] + const.  

Candidate 2 gives  

F₂(x)=−7/2[sec 2x − csc 2x + ln|tan x| + ln|sec 2x+tan 2x|] + const.

These two expressions contain different algebraic terms:
• F₁ has sec² 2x and csc² 2x terms, which F₂ lacks.  
• F₂ has csc 2x and ln|sec 2x+tan 2x| terms, which are absent from F₁.  

No combination of constants can transform one set of terms into the other, so the two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Reasoning:

To decide whether the two candidate antiderivatives are equivalent we only need to check if they can differ at most by an additive constant.  
Differentiate Candidate 2 and compare the result with the integrand

I(x)=−7/(sin³(2x) cos²(2x)).

Let s = sin 2x, c = cos 2x.

Candidate 2:  
F₂(x)=−7/2 [ sec 2x + cos 2x /(2 sin² 2x) + (5/2) ln|tan x| ].

dF₂/dx = −7 s/c² − 14/s + 7 c²/s³  
           = (14 c⁴ − 7)/(s³ c²).

Thus  

dF₂/dx = −7/(s³ c²) + 14 c²/s³.

The extra term 14 c²/s³ is not identically zero, so dF₂/dx ≠ I(x); hence Candidate 2 is not a correct antiderivative.

Candidate 1 produces a completely different expression; even if it were correct, it cannot equal Candidate 2 up to an additive constant because Candidate 2 is not an antiderivative of the integrand at all.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Therefore, the answers are equivalent.

Reasoning:

The question has three sub-parts, so each candidate must supply three corresponding answers.

Sub-answer 1  
Candidate 1:  2 x² − 2 x⁴  
Candidate 2:  2 x² − 2 x⁴  
→ Identical.

Sub-answer 2  
Candidate 1: 1.09861229  
Candidate 2: 1.098612289  
→ Both match to the first 6 significant digits (Rule 4), so they are considered equivalent.

Sub-answer 3  
Candidate 1: 2.62729 × 10⁻⁶  (0.00000262729)  
Candidate 2: 0.000002627      (2.62700 × 10⁻⁶)  

Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):  
Candidate 1: 2 6 2 7 2 9  
Candidate 2: 2 6 2 7 0 0  
They differ at the 5th and 6th significant digits, so the numbers are not equivalent.

Because at least one required sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent (Rule 2).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Reasoning:

The question requires three specific answers.  
Both candidates supply all three, so compare each sub-answer:

1. 4th-order Taylor polynomial:  
   • Candidate 1: 2 x² − 2 x⁴  
   • Candidate 2: 2 x² − 2 x⁴  
   → identical.

2. |f(1) − P₄(1)|:  
   • Candidate 1: 1.09861229  
   • Candidate 2: ln 3 ≈ 1.09861229…  
   → same value to 6 significant digits.

3. |f(0.1) − P₄(0.1)|:  
   • Candidate 1: 2.62729 × 10⁻⁶  
   • Candidate 2: 2.627 × 10⁻⁶ (i.e., 2.62700 × 10⁻⁶ with 6 sig. digits)  
   Comparing to 6 significant digits: 2.62729 vs 2.62700 differ at the 5th/6th digits, so they do not match.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give answers for all nine requested items, but their answers are not identical.

Example of discrepancy:

  – Candidate 2:  (−∞, −9) ∪ (−3, ∞)           (includes 0)

Because the sets differ (one contains the point 0 while the other omits it), the predictions are not the same. Similar mismatches appear in the concavity descriptions as well.

Hence the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

   Since (½)^{t/2.045} = e^{(ln 0.5) t / 2.045}, the two formulas are mathematically identical.

The two candidate expressions coincide for every x with x ≠ 0, because

−x / (|x| √(1 − x²)) = −sign(x)/√(1 − x²)  when x ≠ 0.

However, at x = 0:

• Candidate 1 is undefined (division by |x| = 0).  
• Candidate 2 gives 0 (since sign(0) = 0 in the usual definition).

Because the two expressions differ at x = 0, they are not identical as functions, and thus the predictions are not equivalent.

The two antiderivatives differ only by an additive constant:

1. Rewrite Candidate 1’s logarithmic terms
   • 1 − 2/(3x) = (3x − 2)/(3x) ⇒ ln|1 − 2/(3x)| = ln|3x − 2| − ln|3x|  
   • x − 2/3 = (3x − 2)/3      ⇒ ln|x − 2/3|   = ln|3x − 2| − ln 3

   Candidate 1’s log part:
     −(1/3)ln|x − 2/3| + (1/2)ln|1 − 2/(3x)|
     = −(1/3)[ln|3x − 2| − ln 3] + (1/2)[ln|3x − 2| − ln|3x|]
     = (1/6)ln|3x − 2| − (1/2)ln|x| − (1/6)ln 3.

   The constant −(1/6)ln 3 can be absorbed into the integration constant.

2. After absorbing that constant, Candidate 1 becomes:
     −x² + x − (1/2)ln|x| + (1/6)ln|3x − 2| + C.

3. Candidate 2 is exactly:
     −x² + x − (1/2)ln|x| + (1/6)ln|3x − 2| + C.

Therefore, aside from an overall constant, the two expressions are the same antiderivative.

The two candidate expressions differ in the logarithmic term:

Candidate 1: ln(1 + 5x + √(1 + (5x+1)²))  
Candidate 2: ln(5x + 1 + √(25x² + 10x + 6))

These two inside-log arguments are not proportional by an x-independent constant (e.g., test at x = 0 and x = 1 gives different ratios), so the logarithms are not the same up to an additive constant. Because antiderivatives are considered equivalent only if they differ by a constant, the two overall expressions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: (9/25)·ln| 5x+1 + √(25x²+10x+6) |.

The square–root arguments inside the logs are different ( …+2 vs …+6 ), so the two logarithms cannot differ by a mere constant; their derivatives depend on x in different ways. Consequently the two antiderivatives are not the same up to an additive constant.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both antiderivatives can be written with  

s = √(1 + x²).

Candidate 1:  
F₁ = s + ½ ln│(s − 1)/(s + 1)│ + C.

Candidate 2:  
F₂ = s − ln((1 + s)/x) + C.

Compute their difference (ignoring the arbitrary constants C):

F₂ − F₁  
= −ln((1 + s)/x) − ½ ln((s − 1)/(s + 1))  
= −ln[(1 + s)/x · ((s − 1)/(s + 1))^{½}].

But with x² = s² − 1 ⇒ x = √[(s − 1)(s + 1)], so

(1 + s)/x · √[(s − 1)/(s + 1)]  
= (1 + s) · √(s − 1) / [√((s − 1)(s + 1)) · √(s + 1)]  
= (1 + s) · √(s − 1) / [√(s − 1) · (s + 1)]  
= 1.

Hence the logarithm is ln 1 = 0, so F₂ − F₁ = 0, i.e. the two expressions differ at most by an overall constant (in fact, by 0 apart from branch/absolute-value conventions).

Therefore the two candidates give the same antiderivative up to the usual arbitrary constant.

Both candidates give antiderivatives that differ at most by a constant.

1.  Log terms  
   • Candidate 1:  (3/8) ln[(1+cos 2x)/(1–cos 2x)]  
     Using tan²x = (1–cos 2x)/(1+cos 2x) ⇒ ln[(1+cos 2x)/(1–cos 2x)] = −2 ln|tan x| = 2 ln|cot x|,  
     so the term becomes (3/8)(2 ln|cot x|) = (3/4) ln|cot x|, which matches Candidate 2.

2.  Algebraic terms  
   Rewrite both:

   • Candidate 1:  −cos³(2x)/(4 sin²(2x)) − 3/4 cos 2x  
   • Candidate 2:  −cos 2x/(4 sin²(2x)) − 1/2 cos 2x  

   Difference:

   Δ = [−cos³/(4 sin²) − 3/4 cos] − [−cos/(4 sin²) − 1/2 cos]  
      = −(cos³ − cos)/(4 sin²) − 1/4 cos  
      = −(cos ( cos² − 1 ))/(4 sin²) − 1/4 cos  
      = −(cos (−sin²))/(4 sin²) − 1/4 cos  
      = +(1/4) cos − 1/4 cos = 0.

Hence the two antiderivatives differ only by an overall constant. They are equivalent answers to the integral.

Both results can be rewritten in comparable form.

Candidate 1 simplifies to  
(3/16)x − (3/128) sin 8x − (3/128) sin 4x + (1/128) sin 12x + C.

Using the identity sin 12x = 3 sin 4x − 4 sin³ 4x,

(1/128) sin 12x − (3/128) sin 4x  
= (1/128)(3 sin 4x − 4 sin³ 4x) − (3/128) sin 4x  
= −(1/32) sin³ 4x.

Thus Candidate 1 becomes  
(3/16)x − (3/128) sin 8x − (1/32) sin³ 4x + C,

which is exactly Candidate 2.  
They differ at most by a constant of integration, so the two antiderivatives are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two expressions differ only by trigonometric identities:

sin³(4x) = (3 sin(4x) – sin(12x)) ⁄ 4

so

–(1/32) sin³(4x) = –(3/128) sin(4x) + (1/128) sin(12x).

Substituting this into Candidate 2 makes it identical to Candidate 1 (up to the arbitrary integration constant).  
Therefore the candidates are equivalent.

Both candidates provide a single expression for \(y'\).

Candidate 1:  
\(y' = \dfrac{1}{\sin^{2}x \,\cos^{6}x}\)

Candidate 2:  
\(y' = \dfrac{-8\sin^{4}x + 16 \sin^{2}x - 3}{5\sin^{2}x \,\cos^{6}x} + \dfrac{32}{5}\csc^{2}(2x)\)

Check algebraic equivalence:

1.  Rewrite the second term of Candidate 2 using  
   \(\csc^{2}(2x) = \dfrac{1}{\sin^{2}(2x)} = \dfrac{1}{4\sin^{2}x\cos^{2}x}\):

   \(\dfrac{32}{5}\csc^{2}(2x) = \dfrac{32}{5}\cdot\dfrac{1}{4\sin^{2}x\cos^{2}x}
                               = \dfrac{8}{5}\cdot\dfrac{1}{\sin^{2}x\cos^{2}x}
                               = \dfrac{8\cos^{4}x}{5\sin^{2}x\cos^{6}x}\).

2.  Combine Candidate 2’s two fractions over the common denominator \(\sin^{2}x\cos^{6}x\):

   Numerator becomes  
   \((-8\sin^{4}x + 16\sin^{2}x - 3) + 8\cos^{4}x\).

3.  Use \(\cos^{4}x = (1 - \sin^{2}x)^{2} = 1 - 2\sin^{2}x + \sin^{4}x\):

   \(8\cos^{4}x = 8 - 16\sin^{2}x + 8\sin^{4}x\).

4.  Add to the first part of the numerator:

   \((-8\sin^{4}x + 16\sin^{2}x - 3) + (8 - 16\sin^{2}x + 8\sin^{4}x) = 5\).

5.  Therefore Candidate 2 simplifies to  

   \(y' = \dfrac{5}{5\sin^{2}x\cos^{6}x} = \dfrac{1}{\sin^{2}x\cos^{6}x}\),

   which is exactly Candidate 1.

Hence the two expressions are mathematically identical.

Both candidates give two answers, matching the two sub-questions.

1. For dz/dt they both state   e^t / (e^x + e^t).  (Exactly identical.)

2. For dz/dt when x = t³ they give
   • Candidate 1: (3 e^{t³} t² + e^t)/(e^t + e^x)
   • Candidate 2: (e^t + 3 t² e^{t³})/(e^{t³} + e^t)

   The numerators are the same (just reordered).  
   In the denominators, Candidate 2 has e^{t³}+e^t, while Candidate 1 has e^t+e^x; but under the stated condition x = t³, e^x = e^{t³}. Hence the two denominators are equal, so the entire fractions are identical.

Thus every corresponding answer is mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates give two answers, matching the two sub-questions.

Sub-answer 1:
• Candidate 1: e^t / (e^t + e^x)
• Candidate 2: e^t / (e^x + e^t)

These are identical (addition is commutative).

Sub-answer 2 (with x = t³):
• Candidate 1: (3 e^{t³} t² + e^t) / (e^t + e^x).  Given x = t³, the denominator is e^t + e^{t³}.
• Candidate 2: (3 t² e^{t³} + e^t) / (e^{t³} + e^t).

After replacing x by t³ in Candidate 1’s denominator, both the numerators and denominators match (order of terms is irrelevant).

Thus the two candidates provide equivalent answers for both parts.

The question asks for a single object: “the minimum vertex cover of G,” represented as a list.  
Candidate 1 gives [0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 9].  
Candidate 2 gives [0, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8].

The two lists have different elements (and different lengths), so they are not the same set. Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

The two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 expresses the entropy exactly as log₂(52 choose 26), whose numerical value is approximately 48.8395 bits.  
Candidate 1 gives 48.8 bits.  

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):  
• Candidate 2 ≈ 48.8395  
• Candidate 1 = 48.8000  

Since 48.8000 ≠ 48.8395 to six significant digits, the answers differ.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a numerical value of 48.8 bits (interpreted to six significant digits as 48.8000).

Candidate 2 gives the exact expression log₂(52 choose 26), whose numerical value is approximately 48.8171 bits (to six significant digits).

Since 48.8000 ≠ 48.8171 to six significant digits, the answers differ.

The problem requires a single numerical answer.  
Candidate 1 gives 0.66667, while Candidate 2 gives the exact fraction 2/3.

Expressing both to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1 → 0.666670  
• Candidate 2 (2/3) → 0.666667

These differ at the 6th significant digit (…70 vs …67), so they are not equal according to the required precision.

The two candidates give numerical values.

Candidate 1: 0.0833  → written to six significant digits: 0.0833000  
Candidate 2: 1/12  ≈ 0.0833333

Comparing to six significant digits, 0.0833000 differs from 0.0833333.

Therefore, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are both single numerical values.

Candidate 1: 0.0833  
Candidate 2: 1/12 = 0.083333333…

Expressing each to six significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 → 0.083300 (interpreting the missing digits as zeros)  
• Candidate 2 → 0.083333

These differ at the fourth significant digit, so they are not identical to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

• Candidate 1 lists three numbers: 53.52, 54.25, 54.76  
• Candidate 2 supplies only two numbers: 53.524 and 54.763  

Because the task requires every root to be reported, the two answers must contain the same count of roots and the same values (Rule 2). Candidate 1 has three values while Candidate 2 has only two, so the responses are not equivalent irrespective of the individual numerical differences.

The question asks for all roots of the equation, i.e., a list of numbers.  
• Candidate 1 gives three numbers: 53.52, 54.25, 54.76.  
• Candidate 2 gives two numbers: 53.53, 54.77.

According to Rule 2 and Rule 3:
– The required number of answers must match; here the two candidates list different counts (three vs. two).  
– Even the two numbers that appear in both lists are not identical to 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Hence the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for a rate of return, which is normally expressed as a percentage.  

• Candidate 1: “10.92” – no unit is given, so it could represent 10.92 % or 10.92 (a factor of 10.92, i.e. 1092 %).  
• Candidate 2: “10.92%” – explicitly specifies a percentage.

Because Candidate 1 omits the unit and there are at least two plausible interpretations (percent or a pure number), Rule 1 states that the answers are considered inequivalent due to this ambiguity.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates are single numerical answers.

Candidate 1: 7.853  
Candidate 2: 8 π / 3 ≈ 8.37758

• Candidate 2: e / (e – 1)  → numerically equals 2.718281828 / 1.718281828 ≈ 1.581976 …

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):

1. Candidate 1: 1.58100  
2. Candidate 2: 1.58198

These differ starting at the 5th significant digit, so the answers are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

• Candidate 1: 1.581 → expressed to six significant digits: 1.58100

Since 1.58100 ≠ 1.58198, the answers do not match to six significant digits.

The problem statement specifies that the numerical answer should be given in units of 10¹⁰ J.  
• Candidate 1 supplies the pure number 3.26.  
• Candidate 2 supplies 3.26 × 10¹⁰ J.

Interpreting Candidate 1 in the context of the required unit, it means 3.26 × 10¹⁰ J—the same physical quantity stated explicitly by Candidate 2. The numerical values (3.26 vs. 3.26) match, and the implied/explicit units are consistent.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

Both answers represent the same numerical value once units are aligned:

• Candidate 1: 0.23 (dimensionless)  
• Candidate 2: 23 % = 0.23 in decimal form

Since 0.23 and 23 % are equivalent, the two predictions are the same.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The two answers both represent the same numerical value for the holding-period return.

• Candidate 1: 0.23 (a pure decimal)  
• Candidate 2: 23 % (percentage form)

Converting 23 % to a decimal gives 0.23, which matches Candidate 1 exactly to six significant digits (0.230000 vs. 0.230000). The difference is only in notation; finance problems commonly accept return figures either as a decimal or a percentage. Therefore, under Rule 1 and Rule 4, the two predictions are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the numeric value 0.301700 (to six significant digits).  
Candidate 2 gives the exact expression 2 e² / (1 + e⁴).

Evaluating Candidate 2 numerically:
e² ≈ 7.389056 → 2 e² ≈ 14.778112  
e⁴ ≈ 54.598150 → 1 + e⁴ ≈ 55.598150  
Thus 2 e² / (1 + e⁴) ≈ 14.778112 / 55.598150 ≈ 0.265930.

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:
0.301700 ≠ 0.265930

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

– Candidate 1: 1.400000

The question expects a single numerical answer in nanometres.

Candidate 1: 0.17  (unit omitted, but implicitly nm)

Treating both as nanometres, compare to 6 significant digits:
Candidate 1 → 0.170000
Candidate 2 → 0.173000

Since 0.170000 ≠ 0.173000 (they differ already at the third significant digit), Rule 4 says they are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question requests a single numerical answer in nanometres (nm).

Candidate 1: 0.17  (unit not stated, implicitly nm)
Candidate 2: 0.173 nm

Even assuming Candidate 1’s number is in nm, comparing to six significant digits:

Candidate 1 → 0.170000  
Candidate 2 → 0.173000  

They differ beginning at the third significant digit, so the two answers are not numerically the same. Therefore, the predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 0.17  (implicit unit, nm because the question specifies “in nm”)
Candidate 2: 0.1735 nm

Expressing both to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 2 → 0.173500  

Since 0.170000 ≠ 0.173500, the two answers do not match to 6 significant digits.  
Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: +7.3 kJ mol⁻¹ = 7300 J mol⁻¹  
  (expressed to six significant digits: 7.30000 × 10³ J mol⁻¹)

• Candidate 2: 7281 J mol⁻¹  
  (expressed to six significant digits: 7.28100 × 10³ J mol⁻¹)

7300 J mol⁻¹ ≠ 7281 J mol⁻¹ when compared digit-by-digit to six significant figures. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value (0).  
Candidate 2 states the unit explicitly as joules (“0 J”), while Candidate 1 omits the unit.  
Because the value is zero, the omission of the unit does not introduce meaningful ambiguity—0 J, 0 kJ, etc., are all the same quantity (zero). Thus the two answers are effectively identical.

The two answers are clearly different.

• Candidate 1: +3.60 kJ  ≈ +3600 J  
• Candidate 2: –123.5 J mol⁻¹

After converting to the same unit, +3600 J versus –123.5 J are neither numerically nor sign-wise the same (they differ by thousands of joules). Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give numerical answers: 92 J K⁻¹ and 91.5 J K⁻¹.  
Expressed to six significant digits, these are 92.0000 and 91.5000, which differ.  
Hence, the predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for one numerical value (entropy change).  
Both candidates give a single value in the same unit (J K⁻¹), so we just compare the numbers.

Candidate 1: 92.0000  
Candidate 2: 91.5000

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4), 92.0000 ≠ 91.5000. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

Expressed to six significant digits
 Candidate 1 → 1.35300 × 10⁻⁴  
 Candidate 2 → 1.35200 × 10⁻⁴

The digits differ (…35300 vs …35200), so they do not match to six significant digits.

Candidate 2:  
1.352 × 10⁻⁴ m³ mol⁻¹ = 0.135200 dm³ mol⁻¹

Comparing to six significant digits:  
1.35300 × 10⁻⁴ ≠ 1.35200 × 10⁻⁴.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the numerical value 0.0761.  
Unit comparison:

• Candidate 1: kg m⁵ s⁻² mol⁻²

Since 1 Pa = 1 kg m⁻¹ s⁻²,  
Pa m⁶ = (kg m⁻¹ s⁻²) m⁶ = kg m⁵ s⁻².

Thus the units are identical (kg m⁵ s⁻² mol⁻²), and the numerical values match. Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 2: 6.987 × 10^7 km → 6.98700 × 10^7 km (to 6 significant digits)

7.00000 ≠ 6.98700, so the answers are not the same.

Reasoning:
Both candidates give a single numerical value with the same unit (cm³/s).  
Candidate 1: 1.19 × 10⁻⁴ cm³/s = 1.19000 × 10⁻⁴ (to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 1.191 × 10⁻⁴ cm³/s = 1.19100 × 10⁻⁴ (to 6 significant digits)  

Comparing the two 6-digit sequences:
1 .19000 vs 1 .19100 → they differ at the 4th significant digit.  
According to Rule 4, they must match in all 6 significant digits to be considered equivalent.

The two candidates express the wavelength in different units but after converting 0.123 nm to meters we obtain 1.23 × 10⁻¹⁰ m, while candidate 2 states 1.226 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.  

Expressed to six significant digits these are 1.23000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m and 1.22600 × 10⁻¹⁰ m, which are not identical. Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the work function as 3.52 × 10⁻¹⁹ J.  
Candidate 2 gives it as 2.20 eV.

Converting Candidate 2 to joules:  
2.20 eV × 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV = 3.52479 × 10⁻¹⁹ J.

Compare to 6 significant digits (rule 4):  
Candidate 1: 3.52000 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
Candidate 2: 3.52479 × 10⁻¹⁹ J

The digits differ at the fourth significant place; therefore the two answers are not identical to 6 significant digits. Hence, per the rules, they are not considered equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers express the work function in different units, but after conversion they do not coincide to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 3.52 × 10⁻¹⁹ J → 3.52000 × 10⁻¹⁹ J → 2.196 eV  
• Candidate 2: 2.20 eV → 3.52479 × 10⁻¹⁹ J → 2.20000 eV  

Because 3.52000 ≠ 3.52479 (or 2.196 eV ≠ 2.200 eV) to six significant digits, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 3.52 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
Candidate 2: 2.2 eV

Convert Candidate 2 to joules.

2.2 eV = 2.2 × 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J = 3.52479 × 10⁻¹⁹ J

Now compare the two values to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1: 3.52000 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
• Candidate 2: 3.52479 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  

The digits differ starting at the 4th significant figure (3.52000 vs 3.52479), so they do not match to 6 significant digits. Therefore, according to the guidelines, the two answers are not considered equivalent.

The question asks for one numerical result (the fundamental vibrational frequency).  

Candidate 1 gives a wavenumber: 556 cm⁻¹.  
Candidate 2 gives a frequency: 1.67 × 10¹³ Hz.

Using the physical relation ν = c · (ṽ) with c ≈ 2.99792458 × 10¹⁰ cm s⁻¹,
556 cm⁻¹ corresponds to

ν ≈ 556 × 2.99792458 × 10¹⁰ s⁻¹ = 1.66685 × 10¹³ Hz.

Comparing to Candidate 2’s value (1.67000 × 10¹³ Hz) to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

1.66685 × 10¹³

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷.  
• Expressed to six significant digits, each can be written 1.60200 × 10⁻¹⁷, so they match (Rule 4).  
• The units are effectively the same: candidate 1 writes “J · electron⁻¹” while candidate 2 writes “J”; the question asks for the energy of one electron, so “per electron” is implicit. No unit conflict exists (Rule 1).

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
We need to decide whether the two answers represent the same numerical value.

Candidate 1: 1.602 × 10⁻¹⁷ J per electron  
Candidate 2: 100 eV

Conversion: 1 eV = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
Therefore 100 eV = 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁷ J.

Now compare to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):

• Candidate 1 → 1.602000 × 10⁻¹⁷ J (implicit trailing zeros)  
• Candidate 2 → 1.602176 × 10⁻¹⁷ J

They differ beginning at the 5th significant digit (0 vs 1).  
Since Rule 4 demands equality to 6 significant digits, the two candidates are NOT equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers use different units but can be compared by converting 100 eV to joules:

100 eV = 100 × 1 eV  
1 eV = 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J  
⇒ 100 eV = 1.602 176 634 × 10⁻¹⁷ J

Candidate 1: 1.602 000 × 10⁻¹⁷ J  
Candidate 2 (after conversion): 1.602 176 × 10⁻¹⁷ J

Expressing both numbers to six significant digits, they differ at the 5th and 6th digits. According to Rule 4, the answers must match to six significant digits to be considered equivalent. Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Expressed with the same exponent, they are 1.29000 ×10⁻¹⁰ m vs 1.28000 ×10⁻¹⁰ m.

 sin(1.110720734540) ≈ 0.896019034  
 Product ≈ 2.828427124746 × 0.896019034 ≈ 2.53432454.

Thus Candidate 2 ≈ 2.53432454, which matches Candidate 1 = 2.534324263 to at least the first 6 significant digits (both are 2.53432 ). No unit discrepancies exist; the problem asks for a length, and both provide a numerical length.

Hence the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give the same value expressed in different but equivalent units:

• Candidate 1: 2380 m/s  
• Candidate 2: 2.38 km/s = 2.38 × 10³ m/s = 2380 m/s

Since 2380 m/s equals 2.38 km/s exactly, the two answers are equivalent.

The two answers differ in value:

• Candidate 1: 2.57 × 10¹¹ J  
• Candidate 2: 2.56 × 10¹¹ J  

When expressed with up to six significant digits, they are 2.57000×10¹¹ J and 2.56000×10¹¹ J, which are not identical. Hence, the candidates are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two answers give numerical values:

• Candidate 1: 2.57 × 10¹¹ J  
• Candidate 2: 2.56 × 10¹¹ J  

Putting both in the same scientific‐notation format and writing six significant digits:

• 2.57000 × 10¹¹ J  
• 2.56000 × 10¹¹ J  

They differ in the third significant digit (and beyond), so they do not match to six significant digits. Hence, according to Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers provide a single numerical speed with the same unit (m /s), but the values differ:

• Candidate 1: 13.2 m/s  
• Candidate 2: 4.41 m/s

Since 13.2 ≠ 4.41 (they do not match to 6 significant digits), the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give a single numerical value for the deuteron’s final speed, so only one quantity needs comparison.

Convert Candidate 1 to metres per second:
14.44 km/s = 14.44 × 1000 m/s = 14 440 m/s.

Candidate 2 is 4 967 m/s.

14 440 m/s ≠ 4 967 m/s (they differ far beyond 6 significant digits).

Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical height in kilometers, but the values differ:

Candidate 1: 1590 km  
Candidate 2: 552.6 km  

Since 1590 km ≠ 552.6 km (they do not match to six significant digits), the predictions are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>

The two answers use different units (rad s⁻¹ vs Hz), so convert Candidate 1 to Hz:

f₁ = 2.74 rad s⁻¹ ÷ 2π ≈ 0.436044 Hz  

Write both to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1: 0.436044  
• Candidate 2: 0.436000

They differ at the 5ᵗʰ and 6ᵗʰ significant digits, so they do NOT match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The two answers represent the same physical unit (velocity) and can be put in the same units:  

• Candidate 1: 5275 m/s = 5.275 km/s  
• Candidate 2: 5.2 km/s = 5200 m/s  

Comparing to six significant digits:  
5.27500 km/s ≠ 5.20000 km/s.  

Hence the two predictions are not equivalent.

According to Rule 1 the units are identical (years).  
Applying Rule 4, express both with the same exponent 10⁷:

• Candidate 1: 9 × 10⁷ yr → 9.00000 × 10⁷  
• Candidate 2: 8.99 × 10⁷ yr → 8.99000 × 10⁷

Comparing the first six significant digits: 9.00000 ≠ 8.99000.  
Therefore the two answers are not the same.

The question requires one numerical answer: the rebound angle in degrees.

Candidate 1: 36 °  
Candidate 2: 35.8 °

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:

Candidate 1 → 36.0000  
Candidate 2 → 35.8000  

They are not identical; thus, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates both give a single numerical answer in MeV, so units match.  
Expressed to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 999.500 MeV  
• Candidate 2: 999.489 MeV  

They differ starting at the 4th significant digit (999.500 vs 999.489).  
Therefore, according to Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1: 3700 km = 3 700 000 m  
Candidate 2: 3 704 708 m  

Writing both in scientific notation with six significant digits:  
• Candidate 1: 3.70000 × 10⁶ m  
• Candidate 2: 3.70471 × 10⁶ m  

The sequences of six significant digits differ (3.70000 vs 3.70471).

The problem asks for two pieces of information:
1. A formula (or value) for |𝔇ₙ⁴| when n ≥ 4.
2. The value of |𝔇₃⁴|.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different expressions for n ≥ 4 (a complicated sum versus the simple Catalan number (1/(n+1)) C(2n,n)) and different numbers for n = 3 (1 versus 0). Because the answers do not match for either part, they are not equivalent.

The two candidates disagree on the value when r = s (φ(r) vs φ(r)/r).  
Since at least one requested sub-answer differs, the overall answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different piece-wise values for the required limit:

• When r = s  
  – Candidate 1: φ(r)  
  – Candidate 2: φ(r)/r  

• When r ≠ s  
  – Candidate 1: 0  
  – Candidate 2: φ(r) φ(s)/(r s)

Since the corresponding answers are not the same, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 do not give the same rule.  
• Candidate 1 lets rank = N whenever the top‐grade coefficient of M itself is non-zero, even if the corresponding coefficient of T is zero; then it steps down using coefficients of T.  
• Candidate 2 ignores the coefficients of M completely and always chooses the highest j for which C_{(j)}(T) is non-zero.

Thus there are situations (e.g. N odd, C_{(N)}(M) ≠ 0 but C_{(N)}(T) = 0) where the two prescriptions yield different ranks. Hence the candidates are inequivalent.

The two expressions are not the same.

Candidate 1  
F₁(z,q) = (−zq;q²)∞ / (zq;q)∞

Candidate 2  
F₂(z,q) = ∏_{k=1}^{∞} (1−zqᵏ)/(1−zq^{k+1})

But  
∏_{k=1}^{∞}(1−zq^{k+1}) = ∏_{k=2}^{∞}(1−zqᵏ),  
so F₂(z,q) simplifies to (1−zq), a finite factor.

F₁(z,q) remains an infinite product; expanding for small q gives  
F₁(z,q)=1+2zq+O(q²) ≠ 1−zq+O(q²).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.
The two proposed generating functions are structurally different.  

• Candidate 1 is  
 F₁(z,q)=(-zq;q²)₍∞₎ / (zq;q)₍∞₎,  
so the factor (zq;q)₍∞₎ appears in the denominator.

• Candidate 2 is  
 F₂(z,q)=∏_{k≥1}(1−zqᵏ)(1−zq^{−k})/(1−qᵏ)  
    = (zq;q)₍∞₎ · ∏_{k≥1}(1−zq^{−k}) / (q;q)₍∞₎,  
so (zq;q)₍∞₎ appears in the numerator, and there is an extra z-independent factor (q;q)₍∞₎^{−1} together with the infinite product ∏_{k≥1}(1−zq^{−k}).  

Because the placement of (zq;q)₍∞₎ is opposite in the two expressions and Candidate 2 includes additional factors absent from Candidate 1, the two formulas cannot be identical. Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give opposite conclusions for the two cases (convergence vs. divergence of the series). Therefore, their answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 says the Lebesgue measure is 0 in the convergent case and 1 in the divergent case.

Candidate 2 says the Lebesgue measure equals the numerical value S when the series converges, and is ∞ when the series diverges.

These two prescriptions are clearly different (0 vs S; 1 vs ∞), hence they are not equivalent.

The question asks for “the only non-trivial primitive integer solutions,” which (since the variables are integers) includes all sign variations, not just the single positive one.  

• Candidate 1 supplies the full set of sign variants: (±3, ±5, 11).  
• Candidate 2 lists only the single triple (3, 5, 11).  

Because Candidate 2 provides fewer solutions than Candidate 1, the two answers are not identical. (Rule 2)

Candidate 1 supplies a single expression (“E_c(G,x)= …”) and does not distinguish between G₁ and G₂.  
Candidate 2 supplies two separate polynomials, one for each graph.  

Since the problem asks for two explicit formulas (one for each graph) and Candidate 1 gives only one while Candidate 2 gives two, the two candidates’ answers cannot be equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question requests explicit formulas for the polynomials E_c(G,x) for two different cubic graphs (so two answers are required).

Candidate 1  
• Supplies only one expression (and it is a degree-9 polynomial with a duplicated x⁹ term).  
• Gives nothing separate for G₁ vs. G₂.

Candidate 2  
• States that both graphs have the same chromatic polynomial x(x–1)(x–2)(x–3)(x–4)(x–5), thus presenting two identical degree-6 polynomials (one for each graph).  
• Even though the candidate notes they “are not accurate,” this is still the content of the answer.

The two candidates therefore provide different polynomials (degree-9 vs. degree-6) and also differ in how many polynomials they give. According to Rule 2 and Rule 8, these answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2 supplies a multiplicative expression involving powers of 3 or 4 (an exponentially large integer in the exponents).

These produce different numerical values for essentially every choice of \(e_0,e_1,\dots ,e_s\), so the answers are not equivalent.

a value that depends on m.  

Candidate 2 gives

a constant, independent of m.

Candidate 1 lists the only primitive solutions for r = 5 as (±11, ±1, 3), whereas Candidate 2 lists them as (±1, ±11, 3).

Candidate 1 states explicitly which ring of integers occurs in each congruence class of d mod 4.  
Candidate 2 merely lists the two possible rings but gives no condition linking each to the appropriate congruence class, so it does not fully answer the question.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 explicitly states which ring corresponds to each congruence class of d (d ≡ 1 mod 4 versus d ≠ 1 mod 4).  
Candidate 2 merely lists the two possible rings without saying which one applies to which congruence class. Because the mapping of cases is required by the question, Candidate 2’s answer is ambiguous/incomplete, whereas Candidate 1’s is complete. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for four specific values (one for each case a–d).  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different numerical answers in every case:

a) 1 vs 2  
b) 2 vs 1  
c) 3 vs 1  
d) 4 vs 1  

Since at least one sub-answer differs (in fact, all do), the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 contains the additional relation “μ² − ν² = 0” (after simplifying μ²+η²−ν²−η²), while Candidate 2 does not.

The two candidates give different algebraic expressions:

• Candidate 2: m + n − 1

For these to be identical for all allowed integers (m ≥ 2, n ≥ 1, r ≥ 2) we would need  
r n + m − 2 = m + n − 1 ⇒ (r − 1)n = 1.  
That only holds in the very special case n = 1 and r = 2, not in general. Thus, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates clearly give different expressions for \(F\bigl(T(2n+1,2m,2r)\bigr)\):

• Candidate 1 supplies a piecewise formula that depends on \(m,\;n,\;r\) and \((r,m)\) and on whether \(\dfrac{m}{(r,m)}\) is odd or even.

• Candidate 2 offers two simple alternatives, \(n-r+1\) and \(n-r\), with no mention of \(m\) or \((r,m)\) and with no stated criterion telling which of the two to choose.

These answers are not the same under any reasonable interpretation; they are quantitatively different and not even given in comparable piecewise form. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives  

 F = [m(2n+1)+(r,m)] ⁄ 2 if m / (r,m) is odd,  
 F = m(2n+1) ⁄ 2    if m / (r,m) is even.

Candidate 2 gives  

 F = (2n+1)·m·(r / (r,m))     if m / (r,m) is odd,  
 F = (2n+1)·m·(r / (r,m)) ⁄ 2 if m / (r,m) is even.

The two formulas are clearly different in both cases unless the very special coincidence r = (r,m) (i.e., r divides m and shares no other factors), which is not guaranteed by the problem statement. Hence the candidates are not generally equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different formulas.

Example counter-check:  
Take n = 1, m = 2, r = 1 ⇒ (r,m) = 1 and m/(r,m) = 2 (even).

• Candidate 1: F = m(2n+1)/2 = 2·3/2 = 3.  
• Candidate 2: F = n = 1.  

The values 3 and 1 are not equal, so the formulas cannot be equivalent in general.

The two candidates give different formulas that yield very different numerical values for any fixed intersection number \(i(\alpha,\beta)\).

Example check ( \(i=3\) ):

• Candidate 2:  e^{2π/4} ≈ 4.8105  

Since the values disagree (and in general the asymptotics of the two formulas are completely different), the two answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for two separate chromatic numbers, so both candidates must supply two answers. Both do, but the corresponding expressions differ:

1. χ(SK(n,k)^-):
   • Candidate 1: 2n – 2k + 2  
   • Candidate 2: n – 1  

2. χ(SSG(n,k)^-):
   • Candidate 1: n – k + 2  
   • Candidate 2: 2  

These pairs are clearly not the same (they coincide only for very special choices of n and k, not in general). Hence the candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates list very different sets of quadruples.  
Candidate 1 lists six families of solutions (with various conditions on k), while Candidate 2 lists only two families (and those two do not appear in Candidate 1’s list). Therefore the two answers are not the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates list different collections of quadruples.

• Candidate 1 contains, among others, the family (1, 0, k, 1) (for k ≥ 2) and also tuples whose last coordinate is 2.  
• Candidate 2 never has 0 as the second coordinate in a quadruple with last coordinate 1, and never has last coordinate 2.

Hence the two answers cannot coincide.
Candidate 1 lists a large collection of quadruples; none of them have the form (0, 2, k, 0).  
Candidate 2 gives only quadruples of the form (0, 2, k, 0) (k ≥ 3).  

Because the sets of quadruples provided by the two candidates are different and Candidate 2 is missing most of the cases given in Candidate 1, the two answers are not the same.

The statements are not logically equivalent.

• Candidate 2 (depth (M ⊗_R N) = depth N and depth M = depth R) implies Candidate 1, because substituting those two equalities into Candidate 1’s expression yields an identity.

• However, Candidate 1 (depth M + depth N = depth R + depth (M ⊗_R N)) does not force each of the two separate equalities in Candidate 2 to hold; many other combinations of depths could satisfy Candidate 1’s single equation. 

Thus the two candidates give different assertions.

The two expressions are  

Candidate 1: C(n − 1, k − 1) − C(n − k − 1, k − 1) − C(n − k − 2, k − 2) + 2  

Candidate 2: C(n − 1, k − 1) − C(n − k − 1, k − 1) − 1

Subtracting the two formulas gives  
(Candidate 1) − (Candidate 2) = −C(n − k − 2, k − 2) + 3.

For k ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2k + 1, the binomial coefficient C(n − k − 2, k − 2) is a positive integer ≥ 1 (and usually much larger than 3), so the difference is generally not zero. Hence the two candidates are not identical; they coincide only in a few small, special cases, not in general.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two formulas are not mathematically identical.  

For example, when k = 3 and n = 7 (which satisfies n ≥ 2k + 1),  
Candidate 1 gives  
C₁ = (n−1 choose k−1) − (n−k−1 choose k−1) − (n−k−2 choose k−2) + 2  
  = (6 choose 2) − (3 choose 2) − (2 choose 1) + 2  
  = 15 − 3 − 2 + 2 = 12.  

Candidate 2 gives  
C₂ = (n−1 choose k−1) − (n−2 choose k−2) − 1  
  = (6 choose 2) − (5 choose 1) − 1  
  = 15 − 5 − 1 = 9.  

Since the two results differ (12 ≠ 9) and the discrepancy persists in general, the candidates are inequivalent.
The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 1:  |H| ≤ C₁(n,k) = C(n−1,k−1) − C(n−k−1,k−1) − C(n−k−2,k−2) + 2  
Candidate 2:  |H| = C₂(n,k) = C(n−1,k−1) − 1

For k ≥ 3 and n ≥ 2k+1, the terms C(n−k−1,k−1) and C(n−k−2,k−2) are positive, so  
C₁(n,k) = C₂(n,k) − [ C(n−k−1,k−1) + C(n−k−2,k−2) − 3 ],  
which is strictly smaller than C₂(n,k) in general (e.g., n = 7, k = 3 gives 12 vs 14). Therefore the two answers are not the same expression and hence not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The expressions differ.  
Example with k = 3, n = 7:  
• Candidate 1 gives 12.

  – Candidate 1:  M_n − M_{n−2}  
  – Candidate 2:  M_{n−1}

Since, in general, M_n − M_{n−2} ≠ M_{n−1} (e.g., for n = 3, 4 − 1 = 3 while M_2 = 2), the two candidates give different results. Thus the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different spectra.

• Candidate 2 claims the spectrum is (α_n/R)^2, where α_n are the zeros of J₀, each with multiplicity 1. These are quadratic in 1/R, contain no dependence on λ, μ, and do not include the zero eigenvalue of multiplicity 3 that Candidate 1 states.

Candidate 2  
= (n+1)^{(n+1)/2} Γ(n/2+1)/(n^{n/2} n! π^{n/2})

Taking their ratio:  

(Candidate 1)/(Candidate 2) = n^{n/2} · n^{n/2} = n^{n}.

Unless n=1, they differ by the factor n^{n}; hence the two expressions are not the same.

The two expressions are not equal.

Candidate 1:
 C₁ = n^{n/2}(n+1)^{(n+1)/2} / (n! ωₙ)

 C₁ = n^{n/2}(n+1)^{(n+1)/2} Γ(n/2+1) / (n! π^{n/2}).

Candidate 2:
 C₂ = (n+1)^{(n+1)/2} Γ(n/2+1) / (n^{n/2} n! π^{n/2}).

Comparing, C₁ has n^{+n/2} in the numerator, whereas C₂ has n^{−n/2} in the denominator. Thus

• For n ≡ 0 (mod m):
  – Candidate 1: bc₂(n) = bc₁(n/m) + m(m-1)(m(m-1)+1)
  – Candidate 2: bc₂(n) = bc₁(n) − m + 1  

  These differ because bc₁(n/m) is not, in general, equal to bc₁(n) − m + 1, and the added constants are also different.

• For n not ≡ 0 (mod m):
  – Candidate 1: bc₂(n) = m⁴ − 2m³ + 2m²
  – Candidate 2: bc₂(n) = bc₁(n)

  Again, these expressions are plainly not the same.

Thus the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give completely different piece-wise formulas for the same quantity.  

• For the case  n ≡ 0 (mod m):
  – Candidate 1: bc₂(n) = bc₁(n/m) + m(m − 1)(m(m − 1)+1).  
  – Candidate 2: bc₂(n) = bc₁(n) − m + 1.

• For the case  n ≠ 0 (mod m):
  – Candidate 1: bc₂(n) = m⁴ − 2m³ + 2m².  
  – Candidate 2: bc₂(n) = bc₁(n).

These formulas are plainly not the same (they involve different arguments of bc₁ and different additive terms), so the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 says the count is always Fₙ₊₁.

Candidate 2 says the count is Fₙ when n is even and Fₙ₋₁ when n is odd.

Since, in general, Fₙ₊₁ ≠ Fₙ and Fₙ₊₁ ≠ Fₙ₋₁, the two formulas give different values for almost every n. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 specifies:

• Ω must be (up to measure-0) a ball centred at some point (x₀, ω₀).  
• f must be a non-zero constant multiple of a time-frequency shifted Gaussian, i.e.  
  f(x)=c e^{2πi x·ω₀} φ(x−x₀).

Candidate 2 merely says:

• “Ω is a ball in ℝ^{2d}.”  
• “f is a Gaussian function in ℝ^d.”

Thus candidate 2 omits (or leaves ambiguous) the possible translation of the ball, the modulation/translation factor for f, and the constant multiple; it gives a looser, incomplete condition compared with candidate 1. Therefore the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different algebraic expressions.

Compare their “extra” terms (beyond the common p^k):

Candidate 1 extra term:
(p^{k+1}(p^2−1)(p^{3k}−1)) / (2(p^3−1))

Candidate 2 extra term:
(p^k(p^k−1)(p^k+1)) / 2  = p^k(p^{2k}−1)/2

Set them equal and simplify:

p^{k+1}(p^2−1)(p^{3k}−1)/(p^3−1)  ?=  p^k(p^{2k}−1)

After canceling a factor p^k from both sides:

p(p^2−1)(p^{3k}−1)  ?=  (p^{2k}−1)(p^3−1)

This identity fails, e.g. for p=2, k=1:

The two candidates give entirely different functional forms for the pdf.

• Candidate 1: a weighted finite sum of (shifted-)Gamma–type terms, explicitly depending on L and 𝒜.  
• Candidate 2: a single exponential pdf with rate λ = α, containing no dependence on L or 𝒜.

Because these expressions are not the same function (they are structurally different, involve different parameters, and cannot be algebraically reduced to each other in general), the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give radically different functional forms.  

• Candidate 1 is a weighted finite sum of Gamma–pdf-like terms multiplied by (½)^L and, even for L = 1, produces (1/2A) e^{-ζ/A}.  
• Candidate 2 is simply (1/A) e^{-ζ/A}.  

These are not the same (they differ by the factor (½)^L and by additional terms when L > 1). Therefore the predictions are inequivalent.
Candidate 1 gives a complicated finite sum of Gamma-type terms, not a single exponential; its overall coefficient and functional form differ from the simple exponential given in Candidate 2 (except possibly under very special parameter choices, and even then the normalisation differs). Hence the two pdf expressions are not the same.

Candidate 1 says the similitude must be “non-oblique.”  
Candidate 2 says it must be “orientation-preserving.”

These two descriptions of the required orientation are not clearly the same: “non-oblique” usually means not slanted with respect to the coordinate axes, while “orientation-preserving” specifically rules out reflections but allows arbitrary rotations. Because the terms are not synonymous and could describe different classes of maps, the two answers are not guaranteed to coincide. (The similarity ratio = 1 agrees in both, but orientation is a separate required component.)

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1:  F₁(q)=(-q²;q²)₍∞₎ / (q;q)₍∞₎  
Candidate 2:  F₂(q)=1 / [(q;q)₍∞₎ (q²;q²)₍∞₎]  

Their ratio is  

F₁(q)/F₂(q)=(-q²;q²)₍∞₎ · (q²;q²)₍∞₎   
      = ∏_{k=1}^{∞}(1+q^{2k})(1-q^{2k})  
      = ∏_{k=1}^{∞}(1-q^{4k})  
      =(q⁴;q⁴)₍∞₎ ≠1.

Since the ratio is a non-trivial infinite product, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives 
F₁(q)=(-q²;q²)∞ / (q;q)∞.

Candidate 2 gives 
F₂(q)=1/(q;q)∞ · 1/(q²;q²)∞.

The two answers would be equivalent only if
(-q²;q²)∞ = 1/(q²;q²)∞.

But, using the standard q-Pochhammer identity 
(q²;q²)∞ · (-q²;q²)∞ = (q⁴;q⁴)∞,
we have 
(-q²;q²)∞ = (q⁴;q⁴)∞ / (q²;q²)∞ ≠ 1/(q²;q²)∞.

Hence F₁(q) ≠ F₂(q); the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 states the condition  
0 ∈ conv { overline{f(x)} g(x) : x ∈ M_f }.

Candidate 2 states that the whole set { overline{f(x)} g(x) : x ∈ M_f } lies on the imaginary axis.

These are not logically equivalent:  
• If the set equals {i}, it is contained in the imaginary axis (satisfying Candidate 2) but 0 is not in its convex hull, so Candidate 1 fails.  
• Conversely, the convex hull may contain 0 even when the points are not all purely imaginary (e.g., {1, –1}).  

Hence the two candidates give different criteria.
Candidate 1 says:  
 “0 is contained in the convex hull of the set { \overline{f(x)} g(x) : x ∈ M_f }.”

Candidate 2 says:  
 “The set { \overline{f(x)} g(x) : x ∈ M_f } equals {0} (i.e., every element of the set is 0, so g(x)=0 on M_f).”

If the set itself equals {0}, then certainly 0 lies in its convex hull, so Candidate 2 implies Candidate 1.  
But the converse need not hold: 0 may lie in the convex hull even when the set contains non-zero points. Thus Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are not logically equivalent.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2’s formula involves c only through Γ(2c+1) and Γ(a+b+2c+1); the long product over k has no c at all.

• Candidate 2 simply states the value is m, where m is some positive constant satisfying |F(ω)| ≥ m a.e. This m need only be a lower bound; in general it can be strictly smaller than the essential infimum unless it is chosen to be that supremal bound.

Since the essential infimum and an arbitrary such m need not coincide, the two answers are not equivalent.

2. Candidate 2:  a^{ℓ − t}

They depend on different parameters (Candidate 1 on both \underline{ℓ} and \overline{ℓ}; Candidate 2 on a single ℓ) and are clearly not algebraically identical. Hence, the answers are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not the same.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 each give answers for all three requested parts, so compare each corresponding part:

a)  Both state  #C = pᵏ. (agree)

b)  Candidate 1: “C is p-homogeneous.”
    Candidate 2: “C is a union of cosets of a subgroup of order pᵏ.”

    A p-homogeneous set in Z/pⁿZ need not be (and in general is not) a single coset or a union of cosets of a subgroup of order pᵏ, so these descriptions are not equivalent.

c)  Candidate 1: I = {j₁–1, … , j_k–1}.
    Candidate 2: I = {j₁, … , j_k}.

    The two sets differ by shifting every element by 1, so they are not the same.

Because parts (b) and (c) disagree, the overall answers are inequivalent.

The problem asks for three specific pieces of information.  
Both candidates agree on part (a) (#C = p^k), but:

• Part (b):  
  – Candidate 1 says “C is p-homogeneous.”  
  – Candidate 2 says “C is a union of cosets of a subgroup.”  
  These are not obviously identical statements; one could be strictly stronger or simply different.

• Part (c):  
  – Candidate 1 gives I = {j₁ − 1, …, j_k − 1}.  
  – Candidate 2 gives I = {j₁, …, j_k}.  
  The sets differ by subtracting 1 from every element, so they are certainly not the same.

Since at least one sub-answer differs, by Rule 2 the overall answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 lists exactly 4 ordered triples

Candidate 2 states the solution set is  
(±1, ±1, ±1) and (±1, ∓1, 0).  
Interpreted literally, this includes many more triples, such as (–1, –1, 1) or (–1, –1, –1), that are not in Candidate 1’s list.

Because the two candidates give different sets of solutions, their answers are not identical.

Candidate 2 supplies two much simpler expressions:
 • 𝓛(Q_n)=4n
 • 𝓛(Q′_n)=8n

Unless μ and ν satisfy μⁿ+νⁿ+2 = 2 and μⁿ+νⁿ−2 = 4 for every n—which is not generally true—the two sets of formulas are different. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives instead  
• eigenvalues 2m(1−cos(2π j / n)) with multiplicity m  
• eigenvalues 2n(1−cos(2π k / m)) with multiplicity n  

The two sets of formulas are completely different (different cosine arguments, different constant terms, different multiplicities) and Candidate 2 omits eigenvalue 0 and n+m, while Candidate 1 has them. Therefore the two answers do not match.

Since the expressions are not identical in general (they disagree starting at t = 3), the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidate expressions simplify to the same rational function.

Candidate 1  
 G₁(q)=1/(1−q)+q²/[(1−q)²(1−q²)]  
  = (1−q+q³)/[(1−q)³(1+q)]

The problem asks for two specific independence numbers:
1. α(K^*_{n₁,n₂})
2. α(F_k(K^*_{n₁,n₂}))

Candidate 1 states
• α(K^*_{n₁,n₂}) = n₂  
• α(F_k(K^*_{n₁,n₂})) = n₂

Candidate 2 states
• α(K^*_{n₁,n₂}) = n₁ + 1  
• α(F_k(K^*_{n₁,n₂})) = n₁ + 1 − k

The numerical expressions are plainly different (n₂ vs n₁ + 1, and n₂ vs n₁ + 1 − k). Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for two separate values:
1. α(F_k(K^*_{n₁,n₂}))
2. α(K^*_{n₁,n₂})

Candidate 1 supplies both of them, claiming each equals n₂.  
Candidate 2 supplies only the second value, giving α(K^*_{n₁,n₂}) = n₁, and omits the first entirely.

Because the question requires two answers but Candidate 2 provides only one—and that one also differs from Candidate 1’s value—the two responses are not equivalent (Rule 2).

The two candidates give the same formula for the barycenter mean

• Candidate 2: Σ_{W₂} = Σ_{k=1}^{N} w_k Σ_k + Σ_{k=1}^{N} w_k (μ_k−μ_{W₂})(μ_k−μ_{W₂})ᵀ.

These two expressions are not the same in general (they coincide only in special cases, e.g., all μ_k equal and Σ_k proportional). Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: Σ_{W₂} = Σₖ w_k Σ_k

In general (except in the degenerate case where all Σ_k are identical),  
( Σₖ w_k Σ_k^{1/2} )² ≠ Σₖ w_k Σ_k.

For generic even s ≥ 4 and odd t ≥ 3 (coprime), Candidate 1 evaluates to values greater than 1 (e.g., s = 4, t = 3 gives 2), while Candidate 2 is always 1. Hence the two answers are not the same function of (s, t).

The question asks for two specific closed‐form expressions, one for \(S_D\) and one for \(S_P\).  
Both candidates supply an expression for each of those two quantities, so we compare them term-by-term:

For \(S_D\):

• Candidate 2: \((q^{r};q)_N\,(q^{t};q)_N\,(\varepsilon q^{s};q)_N\)

The two sets of formulas are plainly different—they involve different Pochhammer bases, different parameters inside the Pochhammer symbols, and Candidate 1 uses \(\lceil N/2\rceil\) while Candidate 2 uses \(N\). Hence the answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give

m_k = m_0·2^k

For n_k, rewrite Candidate 1:

n_k = 2^k n_0 (1 + (k m_0)/(2 n_0))
     = 2^k n_0 + 2^{k-1} k m_0
     = 2^{k-1}(k m_0 + 2 n_0)

This is exactly the expression given by Candidate 2.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different lists of eigenvalues and multiplicities.  
• Candidate 1 supplies (n₁ – 1) + (n₂ – 1) + 2 = n₁ + n₂ eigenvalues, matching the order of the join graph.  
• Candidate 2 states eigenvalues of the form λᵢ + n₁ + n₂ – μⱼ and μⱼ + n₁ + n₂ – λᵢ for every pair (i, j), which would generally produce n₁n₂ values, and it does not separately list the zero eigenvalue or the simple n₁ + n₂ value.

The two expressions give different power-series expansions at \(x=0\).

Candidate 1  
P₁(x)=\(\frac{x^{10}+2x^{8}+x^{7}+x^{6}-x^{5}-2x^{4}+x^{3}+2x^{2}-x-1}{x^{10}+x^{8}+2x^{6}-4x^{4}+4x^{2}-1}\)

Evaluating at \(x=0\):
 P₁(0)=\((-1)/(-1)=1\).  
Thus the constant term of the series of P₁(x) is 1.

Candidate 2  
P₂(x)=\(\frac{x}{1-2x^{2}}+\frac{2x^{2}}{\sqrt{1-4x^{2}}}\)

Both addends vanish at \(x=0\), so
 P₂(0)=0.  
The constant term of the series of P₂(x) is therefore 0.

Since their constant terms differ, the two functions—and hence the two candidates—are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give completely different rational functions:

Candidate 1: (x^{10}+2x^8+x^7+x^6−x^5−2x^4+x^3+2x^2−x−1)/(x^{10}+x^8+2x^6−4x^4+4x^2−1)

Candidate 2: x/(1−x−x^2)

These functions are clearly not algebraically identical (different degrees, different coefficients). A quick numerical test (e.g., x = 0.1) shows their values differ by about an order of magnitude. Hence, by Rule 1 (same mathematical quantity, different value) they are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different formulas:

• Candidate 1: s(c) = [(3c + 5)·2^{c-3} + (–1)^c (5 – 3c)] ⁄ 9  
• Candidate 2: s(c) = c – 1

Check a value, say c = 5 (≥ 3):  
Candidate 1 ⇒ s(5) = [(3·5+5)·2^{2} + (–1)^{5}(5–15)] ⁄ 9 = (20·4 + 10) ⁄ 9 = 90 ⁄ 9 = 10  
Candidate 2 ⇒ s(5) = 5 – 1 = 4.

Since they give different results (10 ≠ 4) and thus cannot be the same formula for all c ≥ 3, the candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1: s(c) = [ (3c + 5)·2^{c-3} + (−1)^c (5 − 3c) ] ⁄ 9

Evaluating at c = 5 (≥3), Candidate 1 yields s(5)=10, while Candidate 2 gives s(5)=4, so the formulas disagree. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 2 gives 
    |CS₍ₛ,ₜ₎| = φ(s) φ(t).

The first expression is a sum of two binomial coefficients that depends only on half-integers of s and t, while the second is the product of Euler totients, which depends on the full prime factorizations of s and t.

Candidate 1 gives  
k₃(P\*(q)) = q (q − 1)(q − 5) / 48.

Candidate 2 gives  
k₃(P\*(q)) = q³ (q − 1)(q − 2) / 6.

Form the ratio of the two expressions:

[Cand 2] / [Cand 1]

= (48/6) · (q³/q) · (q − 2)/(q − 5)  
= 8 q² · (q − 2)/(q − 5).

Except in the accidental case where 8 q² (q − 2) = (q − 5), this ratio is not 1, so the two formulas are different for essentially all admissible q (e.g., for q = 9 they give 6 vs. 6804).

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

k₃(P*(q)) = q (q − 1) (q − 5) / 48.

Divide candidate 2 by candidate 1:

[q³ (q − 1)² (q − 3)] / [q (q − 1) (q − 5)]
= q² (q − 1) (q − 3) / (q − 5).

This ratio is not identically 1 for all admissible q, so the two expressions are different. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 1 → 3^{1} = 3

  ≈ 6·3^{ℓ}/(3^{ℓ}+4)(3^{ℓ}+3) ≈ 6/3^{ℓ} for large ℓ (decays exponentially)

Since one expression increases rapidly while the other decreases and they cannot match for all ℓ > 1 (indeed they differ even at ℓ = 2), the answers are not the same number to any consistent six-significant-digit comparison (Rule 4). Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

For any ℓ > 1 (so x > 3), these two quantities are clearly not equal—for example, at ℓ = 2 (x = 9) we get 3 versus roughly 0.384615.

Therefore the two [E] matrices are transposes of each other and are not the same.

• For F:  
– Candidate 1 puts the coefficients i(d−i+1) on the super-diagonal.  
– Candidate 2 places those coefficients down the first column (and shows zeros elsewhere), a completely different pattern.  

Because at least one of the required matrices differs, the two sets of answers are not equivalent by Rule 2/8.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different placements of the non-zero entries.

These two expressions are algebraically different for general m, n, and C_{cc}(H); they coincide only under special, unstated conditions (e.g., if C_{cc}(H)=n). Therefore, they are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the value of φ as a linear expression in n and j (either n + 2j or n + 2j + 1).  
Candidate 2 gives two alternative answers that are explicit powers of 2 (2^{2j-1}·2^{2n} or 2^{2j-1}·2^{2n-2}).  
These are completely different mathematical forms and cannot in general be equal for arbitrary integers n and j. Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different formulas for φ₍ℤ[i]₎(a+bi).

• Candidate 1 says the value is linear in n and j: either n + 2j or n + 2j + 1.  
• Candidate 2 says the value is 2^{2j – 1}(w_n – 1) or 2^{2j – 1}(w_{n+1} – 1), an exponential-in-j expression involving w_n.

These expressions are not the same, nor is there any obvious identity that would make them equal in all cases. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1’s output is the integer n + 2j (or n + 2j + 1).  
Candidate 2’s output is the power 2^{2j+n} (or 2^{2j+n+1}), i.e. an exponential of 2.

Since an integer like n + 2j is not, in general, equal to the exponential 2^{2j+n}, the two candidates give different numerical results for the same cases. Hence the predictions are not equivalent.

The question asks for two separate closed-form expressions, one for each of (a) \(K_n\) and (b) \(K_{m,n}\).  
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different formulas for each part:

(a)  
• Candidate 1: \(\binom{n}{2}!\,\dfrac{n!}{2\,(2n-3)!!}\)  
• Candidate 2: \(n!\)

(b)  
• Candidate 1: \((mn)!\,\dfrac{m+n}{\binom{m+n}{m}}\)  
• Candidate 2: \(2mn\,(m+n-2)!\)

Since the formulas given by the two candidates are plainly not the same for either part (and already disagree for the simple case \(n=2\)), the two answers are not equivalent.

 v^{(1)} = (γ I ⊖ A)^{adj}_{:,1}.

• Candidate 2 asserts a specific constant-valued formula χ(z) = (I_d − H'(0))^{-1} c, which is a much more restrictive claim and in general does not coincide with the general solution implied by the functional equations (especially because it ignores the dependence on the residue class j).

The two candidates give different decompositions:

• Candidate 1 uses

  – multiplicity gcd(r_i,t_j) copies of each matrix algebra.

• Candidate 2 uses
  – a single copy and
  – field extension of degree r_i t_j.

Since lcm(r_i,t_j) ≠ r_i t_j and gcd(r_i,t_j) may be > 1 in general, the two decompositions are not the same. Hence the answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give different field sizes and different multiplicities for each matrix block.

Candidate 1:
• Field extension degree = lcm(r_i, t_j)  
• Multiplicity = gcd(r_i, t_j)

Candidate 2:
• Field extension degree = r_i t_j  
• Multiplicity = 1

Unless every pair (r_i, t_j) is coprime (which is not assumed in the problem), these two decompositions are generally not the same. Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 decomposes each \(i,j\) component into 

 gcd\((r_i,t_j)\) copies of \(M_{n_i m_j}\bigl(\F_{q^{\operatorname{lcm}(r_i,t_j)}}\bigr)\).

Candidate 2 gives a single copy of  
\(M_{n_i m_j}\bigl(\F_{q^{r_i t_j}}\bigr)\).

Because in general  
\(\F_{q^{r_i}}\!\otimes_{\F_q}\!\F_{q^{t_j}}
\cong \bigl(\F_{q^{\operatorname{lcm}(r_i,t_j)}}\bigr)^{\oplus\gcd(r_i,t_j)}\),
not \(\F_{q^{r_i t_j}}\),
the two decompositions coincide only when \(\gcd(r_i,t_j)=1\).  
Hence they are not equivalent in general.

Candidate 2

Key mismatches:  
• λ₁ contains an explicit “+ 1” term outside the fraction; λ₂ does not.  
• λ₁ has the coupling with ρ inside a product (… – ρ) and divided by (1 + \overlineγ_e g_e); λ₂ has ρ only inside a square-root, as 4 ρ², independent of the other parameters.  
• The algebraic forms cannot be manipulated to coincide for general parameter values.

For arbitrary positive integers m, n and positive parameters C_{cc}(G), C_{cc}(H), the maximum of two positive numbers is generally not equal to their sum (except in the special case where one of the two quantities is 0, which is excluded here because the graphs are non-trivial and the parameters are assumed positive).

Candidate 1: 1/(2 ln 2) ≈ 0.720 (rounded to six significant digits: 0.720000)

These values clearly differ, so the two answers are not equivalent.

Based on the information given, Candidate 1 states the common value is “Mₙ,” while Candidate 2 states it is “n!”.  There is no indication in the problem that Mₙ is defined to equal n!; thus the two answers represent different quantities. Consequently, the two candidates’ predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different explicit answers:

• Candidate 1: “Mₙ” (an unspecified sequence named Mₙ).  
• Candidate 2: “n!”

There is no statement in the problem that Mₙ equals n!, so the two answers are not the same. Therefore, the candidates are inequivalent.

Candidate 1 asserts a precise closed-form formula, giving counts
C(n,k)=C(2n−2−k,k).

Candidate 2 says the answer is OEIS A000354, and for n=4 claims the numbers are [1,7,6].  
For n=4 candidate 1’s formula yields [1,5,6,1], which is different.  
Hence the two answers disagree.

The two candidates give different formulas for both mₖ and nₖ.

• mₖ:
  – Candidate 1: mₖ = qᵏ m₀  
  – Candidate 2: mₖ = (q + 1)ᵏ m₀  
  These are equal only in the degenerate case q = 0 or when k = 0, but in general they differ.

• nₖ:
  – Candidate 1: nₖ = qᵏ n₀ ( (k/q)(m₀/n₀) + 1 )  
  – Candidate 2: nₖ = m₀ (q + 1)ᵏ + (n₀ − m₀) qᵏ  
  These expressions are also not the same for general q, k, m₀, n₀.

Since the formulas do not coincide, the two candidates are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different explicit formulas for both mₖ and nₖ:

• mₖ  
 – Candidate 1: mₖ = qᵏ m₀  
 – Candidate 2: mₖ = m₀ (q + 1)ᵏ  

These two expressions are equal only in the special (and generally irrelevant) case q + 1 = q (which never happens for finite q), so they are not equivalent.

• nₖ  
 – Candidate 1: nₖ = qᵏ n₀ [(k/q)(m₀/n₀) + 1]  
 – Candidate 2: nₖ = n₀ (q + 1)ᵏ  

These are plainly different formulas for any non-trivial parameters.

Since both required quantities differ, the two candidates’ answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas:

Candidate 1:  ⌈[(n − 3)(n − 4) − 2t]/12⌉  
Candidate 2:  ⌈[(n − 2)(t − 2)]/12⌉

Expand both numerators:
• Candidate 1 → n² − 7n + 12 − 2t  
• Candidate 2 → (n − 2)t − 2n + 4

These polynomials are not identically equal for general n and t.  
Example with n = 6, t = 0:

Candidate 1 numerator = 6 → value = ⌈6/12⌉ = 1  
Candidate 2 numerator = −8 → value = ⌈−8/12⌉ = 0

Because the results differ, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two formulas are clearly different expressions:

• Candidate 2:  ⌈((n − 2)(t − 2))/4⌉      (increases when t increases)

Because the functional dependence on t (and n) is not the same, the two answers cannot coincide for all permitted values of n and t. Hence the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different kinds of answers.

• Candidate 1 supplies a detailed, piece-wise decomposition of 𝔅(Q₄p²) into disjoint unions of complete graphs with specified multiplicities, distinguishing the cases p = 2 and p ≥ 3.

• Candidate 2 merely states that 𝔅(Q₄p²) “is isomorphic to the dicyclic group of order …,” providing only general descriptive remarks; it does not match the explicit structure (and graph decomposition) that Candidate 1 lists.

Because the contents are not the same and do not match in detail, the two answers are not equivalent.

One is a single infinite product, the other is a sum of two reciprocals of different infinite products. There is no standard identity that would make these two distinct forms equal, and their first few q-series coefficients differ. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different mathematical expressions.

  (1 − q + O(q²)) + √2 (1 − q² + O(q³))
  = 1 − q + √2 + O(q²),

For generic integers n, m, r these two expressions coincide only in very special, accidental cases (if ever); in general they produce different numbers. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates are not equivalent.

Example check:  
Take n = 2, m = 2, r = 1.

The two expressions are plainly different:

• Candidate 1 gives a complicated rational-polynomial factor multiplied by two binomial coefficients, and it is (in general) non-zero for many values of k.

• Candidate 2 is simply  (m+n−1 choose m) times a Kronecker delta δ_{k,r+s}.  This is zero unless k = r+s, and equals that single binomial coefficient when k = r+s.

Since Candidate 1 is not identically the same expression as Candidate 2 (they differ in both general form and in which k they allow to be non-zero), the answers are not equivalent.

Unless (q^{1/2};q)_∞^2 equals (q;q)_∞^2, which is not a known identity and in general is false (they differ already in the very first product factors), the two expressions are not the same. Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.
The two expressions are different:

Candidate 1: (q^{1/2}; q)_∞² / (q; q)_∞

For them to be equal we would need
(q^{1/2}; q)_∞² = (q; q)_∞²  ⇔ (q^{1/2}; q)_∞ = (q; q)_∞,

but (q^{1/2}; q)_∞ = ∏_{n=0}^∞(1 − q^{n+1/2}) differs term-by-term from (q; q)_∞ = ∏_{n=0}^∞(1 − q^{n+1}). Hence the two candidates are not equivalent (except in the degenerate cases q = 0 or q = 1, which are not relevant here).

The two answers use different units but can be converted:

Candidate 1: 8.8 × 10¹⁰ m  
Candidate 2: 0.592 AU ≈ 0.592 × 1.496 × 10¹¹ m ≈ 8.856 × 10¹⁰ m

Expressed with the same exponent, we compare:

• Candidate 1: 8.80000 × 10¹⁰ m  
• Candidate 2: 8.85632 × 10¹⁰ m  

They differ already at the third significant digit. According to Rule 4, they must match to 6 significant digits to be equivalent, which they do not. Hence, the two predictions are not equivalent.

The two answers are expressed in different units, but after converting Candidate 1 to days we obtain:

2.24 × 10⁷ s ÷ 86 400 s/day ≈ 259.259 days

Comparing to Candidate 2’s “259 days,” the values differ beginning at the fourth significant digit (259.259 vs 259.000). According to Rule 4, they are not equal to 6 significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1: 2.24 × 10⁷ s  
Candidate 2: 259 days

Convert Candidate 2 to seconds:
259 days × 86 400 s/day = 22 377 600 s = 2.23776 × 10⁷ s.

Express both to six significant digits with the same exponent (10⁷):
• Candidate 1: 2.24000 × 10⁷  
• Candidate 2: 2.23776 × 10⁷

The digits differ at the 3rd significant place (…4 000 vs …3 776), so they do not match to six significant digits. According to Rule 4, the answers are not equivalent.

The numerical value of arccos(2/3) ≈ 0.841068 rad, which equals 48.189685 ° when converted to degrees. Candidate 1 gives 48.189685 °, while Candidate 2 gives arccos(2/3). After unit conversion they represent the same angle.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives the angle explicitly as 48.189685 °.

Candidate 2 gives the angle as arccos(2/3).  
Evaluating arccos(2/3):

arccos(2/3) ≈ 0.84106867 rad  
0.84106867 rad × (180 °/π) ≈ 48.189685 °

Thus, when expressed in the same unit (degrees), both candidates correspond to 48.189685 °; they agree to 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers correspond to the same numerical angle.

•  arccos(2/3) ≈ 0.84106867 rad  
   Converting to degrees: 0.84106867 rad × (180/π) ≈ 48.189685 °.

•  Candidate 1 explicitly gives 48.189685 °.

Thus, after accounting for the conventional radian interpretation of arccos, the two predictions are equivalent to at least six significant digits.
The question asks for a single angle.  
• Candidate 1 gives 48.189685 °.  
• Candidate 2 gives arccos(2/3).

Evaluate arccos(2/3):
arccos(2/3) ≈ 0.841068673 rad.  
Convert Candidate 1’s value to radians:
48.189685° × (π/180) ≈ 0.841068661 rad.

To 6 significant digits both are 0.841069 rad, so the two answers represent the same angle. Hence the two candidates are equivalent.

The two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a single numerical value (2.3613) that is independent of the damping coefficient γ, whereas Candidate 2 gives a formula that depends explicitly on γ:  

t₁ = 1 + arccos(γ/2) / √[1 − (γ/2)²].

Since γ is a free parameter in the problem, Candidate 2 represents a whole family of possible values, while Candidate 1 fixes one particular number. They cannot be the same for arbitrary γ. Therefore the candidates are inequivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value −1.642876.

Candidate 2 gives the symbolic expression  
y₀ = 21/8 − (9/8)e^{4/3}.  
Evaluating this expression numerically:

e^{4/3} ≈ 3.793667  
(9/8)e^{4/3} ≈ 1.125 × 3.793667 ≈ 4.267875  
21/8 = 2.625  
2.625 − 4.267875 ≈ −1.642875

So candidate 2’s value is ≈ −1.642875.  

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits:

Candidate 1: −1.642876 → −1.64288 (6 s.d.)  
Candidate 2: −1.642875 → −1.64288 (6 s.d.)

They match to six significant digits, hence the two answers are equivalent.

Both candidates give a single numerical value for the decay-rate r, but they use different time units.

• Candidate 1: 0.02828 day⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 0.198 week⁻¹

Convert Candidate 2 to per day:
0.198 week⁻¹ ÷ 7 days/week = 0.0282857 day⁻¹.

Express each answer to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 0.0282800  
• Candidate 2 → 0.0282857  

The two values differ in the 5th and 6th significant digits. Rule 4 requires an exact match to six significant digits; therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical answer 10.7598.

Candidate 2 gives the expression 
6 ln(10 / √(96/23)).

Evaluating candidate 2:
96/23 ≈ 4.173913  
√(96/23) ≈ 2.0430  
10 / √(96/23) ≈ 4.895  
ln(4.895) ≈ 1.588  
6 × 1.588 ≈ 9.53.

Thus candidate 2 ≈ 9.53, while candidate 1 = 10.7598.  
These differ well beyond 6 significant digits, so the two answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates express the same numerical value:

Candidate 1: 1.5

Candidate 1 gives 0.18162 ft.  
Candidate 2 gives √19 / 24 ft ≈ 0.181620789 ft.

Expressing both to 6 significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 0.181620  
• Candidate 2: 0.181621  (rounded from 0.181620789)

The values differ in the 6th significant digit, so by Rule 4 they are not considered identical.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
0.18162 ft  ≠  (√19)/24 ft  

Evaluating (√19)/24 ≈ 0.181620789 ft.  
Expressing both numbers to six significant digits gives  

• Candidate 1: 0.181620  
• Candidate 2: 0.181621  

Since they do not match to six significant digits, the two answers are not equivalent.

The exact value of −arctan(√3/4) is approximately −0.408637 rad.

• Candidate 1 gives −0.40864 rad  
  (treated as −0.408640 when written to six significant digits).

• Candidate 2 gives −arctan(√3/4) ≈ −0.408637 rad  
  (written to six significant digits: −0.408637).

Comparing to six significant digits:  
0.408640 ≠ 0.408637.

Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 gives −0.408640 rad.  
Candidate 2 gives arctan(√3 / 4). 

Compute arctan(√3 / 4):

√3 ≈ 1.732051 → √3 / 4 ≈ 0.433013  
arctan(0.433013) ≈ +0.408407 rad.

Thus:

Candidate 1: −0.408640 rad  
Candidate 2: +0.408407 rad

They differ in sign (and hence by more than 6 significant digits), so the two predictions are not the same quantity.

The two candidates give results in different units, but converting Candidate 2’s “8.55 g” to m/s² (using 1 g ≈ 9.80 m/s²) gives about 83.79 m/s². Candidate 1 states 83.81 m/s².  
For a 6-significant-digit comparison (Rule 4), we can write them as  
• Candidate 1: 8.38100 ×10¹ m/s²  
• Candidate 2: 8.37900 ×10¹ m/s² (or 8.38469 ×10¹ m/s² if 1 g = 9.80665 m/s²).  

The digits differ at least by the 4th significant figure, so they are not identical to six significant digits.  

Hence, the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates provide numerical answers.

Candidate 1: 5.1 × 10² N = 510 N  
Candidate 2: 512.6 N

Expressed with the same exponent:
• Candidate 1 → 5.10000 × 10² N  
• Candidate 2 → 5.12600 × 10² N

Comparing to 6 significant digits: 5.10000 ≠ 5.12600.

Since 47.0000 ≠ 46.7000, the two predictions do not match to six significant digits. They are therefore not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical value “2.7 10^6” with no unit stated.  
Candidate 2 gives “2.7 × 10^6 m/s”, explicitly in metres per second.

Because the question asks for a speed, a unit is required. The absence of any unit in Candidate 1 creates ambiguity (Rule 1). Therefore, the two answers are not considered equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a speed, which requires a unit (normally m/s).  
• Candidate 1 gives the value “2.7 10⁶” with no unit.  
• Candidate 2 gives “2.7 × 10⁶ m/s,” explicitly including the unit.

Under Rule 1, if a unit is omitted and multiple units could reasonably be used, the omission creates ambiguity and the answers are considered inequivalent. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
The question asks for a speed. A proper answer therefore needs both a numerical value and an appropriate speed unit (normally m/s).

• Candidate 1: “2.7 10^6”  
  – Lacks the multiplication sign (but likely means 2.7 × 10^6)  
  – Crucially, gives no unit, so the quantity could be interpreted in various units (m/s, cm/s, etc.). This omission makes the answer ambiguous.

• Candidate 2: “2.7 × 10^6 m/s”  
  – Supplies both the value and the correct unit.

Because Candidate 1 omits the unit and thus introduces ambiguity, while Candidate 2 includes it, the two answers are not considered equivalent under Rule 1.

Both candidates give the same numerical value (8.99 × 10^9) and the same unit (newtons, N).

Expressed with six significant digits:

Candidate 2 → 3.82000 × 10⁻⁸ C m⁻²  

Because 3.80000 × 10⁻⁸ differs from 3.82000 × 10⁻⁸ at the third significant digit, the two answers are not identical to six significant digits. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives 48 mJ, which equals 0.048 J.  
Candidate 2 gives 0.040 J.

0.048 J ≠ 0.040 J (they differ already in the first significant digit), so the two answers are not the same.

The two predictions use different units (eV vs J).  
Converting 14 eV to joules:

14 eV × 1.602176634 × 10⁻¹⁹ J / eV = 2.24305 × 10⁻¹⁸ J  (to six significant digits)

Candidate 2 is 2.25 × 10⁻¹⁸ J, which is 2.25000 × 10⁻¹⁸ J to six significant digits.

Because 2.24305 × 10⁻¹⁸ J ≠ 2.25000 × 10⁻¹⁸ J at the six-significant-digit level, the two answers are not equivalent under Rule 4.

Candidate 2: 84.8 g mol⁻¹

To six significant digits these are 85.0000 and 84.8000, respectively, which are not identical. Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The problem asks for a single numerical value (the molar mass).  

Candidate 1 gives 85 g mol⁻¹.  
Candidate 2 gives 84.9 g mol⁻¹.

Expressed to six significant digits, these are 85.0000 and 84.9000; they differ in the third significant digit, so they are not identical to six significant figures.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2: –0.35 °C  →  –0.35 °C + 273.15 = 272.80 K

Expressing each to six significant digits yields 272.800 K for both. Therefore the two predictions are equivalent.

• Candidate 2: −6.044 eV  →  expressed to six significant digits would be −6.04400 eV

The figures differ beginning at the fourth significant digit (…04697 vs …04400), so they are not equivalent.

First convert Candidate 1 to the same unit as Candidate 2.  
82258 cm⁻¹ × (100 m/cm) = 8.2258 × 10⁶ m⁻¹.

Candidate 2 gives 8.23 × 10⁶ m⁻¹.

Comparing to six significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1: 8.22580  
• Candidate 2: 8.23000  

They differ starting at the fourth significant digit, so they are not identical to six significant digits. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

• Numerical values are identical once expressed with the same exponent (both 9.13 × 10⁻³⁵).  
• Matching up to six significant digits (9.13000 vs 9.13000 if zeros are appended).

Candidate 1: 27 kcal mol⁻¹  
Candidate 2: 1.87 × 10⁻¹⁹ J (per molecule)

Convert candidate 2 to kcal mol⁻¹:

1.87 × 10⁻¹⁹ J × (6.022 140 76 × 10²³ mol⁻¹) ≈ 1.126 × 10⁵ J mol⁻¹  
1 kcal = 4184 J → 1.126 × 10⁵ J mol⁻¹ ÷ 4184 J kcal⁻¹ ≈ 26.93 kcal mol⁻¹

Thus, to six significant digits the two numbers are:

Candidate 1: 27.0000  
Candidate 2: 26.9300

They do not match to six significant digits, so by Rule 4 the two answers are not considered equivalent.
The two candidates express the energy in different units (kcal · mol⁻¹ vs J), so we convert one for comparison.

27 kcal · mol⁻¹ × 4184 J · kcal⁻¹ = 1.12968 × 10⁵ J · mol⁻¹  
1.87 × 10⁻¹⁹ J × 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹ = 1.127 × 10⁵ J · mol⁻¹  

These give ≈ 112,968 J · mol⁻¹ vs ≈ 112,700 J · mol⁻¹, or 27 kcal · mol⁻¹ vs 26.9 kcal · mol⁻¹. The numbers differ in the third significant figure and therefore do not match to six significant digits as required by Rule 4. Hence, according to the strict comparison criterion, the two answers are considered different.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates state their answers in different units, so we first convert one of them so that both are expressed in the same unit per molecule:

• Candidate 1: 27 kcal mol⁻¹  
 27 kcal mol⁻¹ × 4184 J kcal⁻¹ = 1.12968 × 10⁵ J mol⁻¹  
 (1.12968 × 10⁵ J mol⁻¹)/(6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹) ≈ 1.8766 × 10⁻¹⁹ J per molecule

• Candidate 2: 1.87 × 10⁻¹⁹ J (implicitly per molecule, since no “per mol” is given)

Comparing the two numerical values to six significant digits:

1.87662 × 10⁻¹⁹  
1.87000 × 10⁻¹⁹  

They differ at the fourth significant digit (6 vs 0), hence they do not match to six significant digits.  
Moreover, the omission of “per molecule” (or “per mol”) in Candidate 2 creates unit ambiguity relative to Candidate 1’s explicit “per mol”.

Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value expressed in different, but convertible, units.

• Candidate 1: 0.332 nm  
   1 nm = 1 × 10⁻⁹ m  
   0.332 nm = 0.332 × 10⁻⁹ m = 3.32 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

• Candidate 2: 3.32 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Hence, after conversion, each answer is 3.32 × 10⁻¹⁰ m.  
Expressing both numbers to six significant digits (by appending trailing zeros does not change the value): 3.32000 × 10⁻¹⁰ m for each. The two answers therefore match exactly to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both answers represent the same physical quantity:

1. Candidate 1: 0.332 nm  
   → in metres: 0.332 nm × (10⁻⁹ m / 1 nm) = 3.32 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

2. Candidate 2: 3.32 × 10⁻¹⁰ m

Thus, after unit conversion the numerical values match exactly (3.32 × 10⁻¹⁰ m). By Rule 1 (unit conversion) and Rule 4 (match to 6 significant digits—0.332000 nm vs 0.332000 nm), the two predictions are equivalent.

The two candidates are expressed in different units (J / T vs μ_B). Converting Candidate 2 to J / T gives  
2.0023 μ_B ≈ 2.0023 × 9.274 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T ≈ 1.857 × 10⁻²³ J/T.  

Candidate 1 is 1.61 × 10⁻²³ J/T, which differs from 1.857 × 10⁻²³ J/T by much more than 1 part in 10⁶. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidates give numerical values in the same unit (J/T), so compare magnitudes.

Candidate 1: 1.61 × 10⁻²³ J/T  
Candidate 2: 5.6 × 10⁻²⁴ J/T = 0.56 × 10⁻²³ J/T

Expressed with the same exponent 10⁻²³, we have 1.61 vs 0.56.  
These differ already in the first significant digit; they do not match to 6 significant digits (or even 1).

Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 provides a single numerical value, 0.3359.

Candidate 2 provides a symbolic sum  
∑_{k=27}^{50} C(50,k) (½)^{50}.  
Evaluating this sum gives approximately 0.336517 (to six significant digits).

Comparing the two numbers to six significant digits (Rule 4):  
0.335900 vs. 0.336517 → they differ in the 4th decimal place, so they are not equal.  
Furthermore, Candidate 1 does not give the requested “sum,” whereas Candidate 2 does, so the responses are also not equivalent in form.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two answers are numerical probabilities.

Convert Candidate 2 to decimal:
1 / 4165 ≈ 0.000240095 …

Candidate 1 is 0.00024 = 0.000240000 …

Comparing to 6 significant digits (Rule 4):
• Candidate 1: 0.000240000  
• Candidate 2: 0.000240095  

The digits differ (…000 vs …095), so the answers are not the same.

  (to 6 significant digits: 0.648004)

Since the two results match to 6 significant digits, the answers are equivalent.

Candidate 2: 0.0642

Expressed to six significant digits:
• Candidate 1 → 0.0640000  
• Candidate 2 → 0.0642000  

The values differ starting at the third significant digit (0 vs 2). Therefore, the two answers are not the same.

Candidate 1 gives the numerical probability as  
0.0000092  ( = 9.2 × 10⁻⁶).

Candidate 2 gives it as  
1/108290 ≈ 0.0000092345  ( = 9.2345 × 10⁻⁶).

Expressing both to six significant digits:

• Candidate 1: 0.00000920000  
• Candidate 2: 0.00000923446 (exact value continues)

The two values differ beginning at the third significant digit (9.20000 × 10⁻⁶ vs 9.23446 × 10⁻⁶), so they are not equal to six significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for a single numerical answer (the number of possible four-letter code words).  
Candidate 1 gives 358 800.  
Candidate 2 gives 456 976.  

They are different numbers, so the answers are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The question asks for a single numerical value (standard Gibbs energy of formation).  
Both candidates give one value with the same unit (kJ mol⁻¹).

However:
• Candidate 1: −131.1 → expressed to 6 significant digits would be −131.100  
• Candidate 2: −131.13 → expressed to 6 significant digits would be −131.130  

Comparing these six-digit strings (131100 vs 131130) shows a difference at the 5th significant digit.  
Per Rule 4, they must match to 6 significant digits; they do not.

Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 gives −131.1 kJ mol⁻¹ (which, when written to six significant digits, is −131.100 kJ mol⁻¹).
Candidate 2 gives −131.13 kJ mol⁻¹ (which, to six significant digits, is −131.130 kJ mol⁻¹).

Since −131.100 ≠ −131.130 at six significant digits, the two answers are not identical.

Candidate 2: 1.01 × 10⁻¹⁹ m²

3.18 × 10⁻¹⁹ m² ≠ 1.01 × 10⁻¹⁹ m² (values differ by more than a factor of 3 and do not match to 6 significant digits).

Expressed to six significant digits:

The two answers are numerical values with the same unit (joules), so compare the numbers themselves.

Express each to six significant digits with the same exponent (10⁻⁹):

• Candidate 2: 2.9 × 10⁻⁹ J  → 2.90000 × 10⁻⁹ J

Comparing 2.89000 vs 2.90000, they differ at the third significant digit, so they are not equal to 6 significant digits.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Both candidates give single numerical answers but with different units:

• Candidate 1: 8.44 × 10³⁴ m⁻³ s⁻¹  
• Candidate 2: 5.7 × 10⁸ s⁻¹

Since the units differ, we must convert one to the other to see if they can match (Rule 1).  
Taking the usual number density of a gas at 1 atm and 298 K (≈2.46 × 10²⁵ m⁻³), converting Candidate 1 to a per-molecule frequency gives

(8.44 × 10³⁴ m⁻³ s⁻¹) / (2.46 × 10²⁵ m⁻³) ≈ 3.43 × 10⁹ s⁻¹.

Comparing 3.43 × 10⁹ s⁻¹ with 5.7 × 10⁸ s⁻¹ (Candidate 2) shows they differ by nearly an order of magnitude and certainly not within 6 significant digits (Rule 4).

Thus the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give answers with different units:

Candidate 2: 1.45850 × 10³ (to 6 significant digits)

The values differ beginning at the fourth significant digit, so they are not identical to 6 significant digits as required by Rule 4.

Therefore, the two predictions are not equivalent.

Both candidates give the same numerical value, 5.85 × 10⁴ (≈ 58 500).  
Candidate 2 explicitly appends the unit K, whereas Candidate 1 omits it.  
Because the context (a Boltzmann-type population ratio) essentially dictates that the temperature must be expressed in kelvin, the absence of the unit in Candidate 1 does not introduce a realistic alternative unit or cause meaningful ambiguity. Therefore the two answers are effectively the same.

Converting Candidate 2 to seconds (15 400 yr × 3.15576 × 10⁷ s/yr) ≈ 4.85987 × 10¹¹ s.  
Comparing to Candidate 1’s 4.86000 × 10¹¹ s, the numbers differ in the third significant digit (4.86000 vs 4.85987).

Rule 4 requires the two values to match to six significant digits; they do not. Therefore, the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates express the age in different units (seconds vs. years).  
Converting Candidate 1’s result to years:

4.86 × 10¹¹ s ÷ 3.15576 × 10⁷ s/yr ≈ 1.53996 × 10⁴ yr ≈ 15 400 yr.

Candidate 2 gives 15 390 yr.

Expressing both answers to six significant digits for comparison:

• Candidate 1 ≈ 15399.6 yr  
• Candidate 2 = 15390.0 yr  

The two numbers differ at the 5th significant digit (…99.6 vs …90.0), so by Rule 4 they are not equivalent.

The two answers give the same units (J K⁻¹) but differ numerically:

• Candidate 1: 24.400000 (extended to 6 significant digits)  
• Candidate 2: 24.440000 (extended to 6 significant digits)

Since they are not identical to six significant digits, the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 both state that the function has no relative minima or maxima, but they disagree on the list of saddle‐point coordinates.  

• Candidate 1: saddle points at (−2, 2) and (2, 2).  
• Candidate 2: saddle points at (0, 0), (2, 2), and (−2, 2).

Because the answers to sub-problem 3 differ, the two candidates’ overall predictions are not identical (Rule 2).

Both candidates give the derivative in the form

y′ = √[ x⁵(2x⁶ + 3) / (1 – 2x)^{1/3} ]  ·  ( … ),

so the only issue is whether the parenthesised factors coincide.

Candidate 2’s factor  
R₂ = 5/(2x) + 6x⁵/(2x⁶+3) + 1/[3(1–2x)]

Combine over the common denominator 2x(2x⁶+3)·3(1–2x):

Numerator = 5(2x⁶+3)(3–6x) + 6x⁵·2x(3–6x) + (2x)(2x⁶+3)  
           = –128x⁷ + 66x⁶ – 84x + 45

Denominator = 2x(2x⁶+3)·3(1–2x)  
             = –24x⁸ + 12x⁷ – 36x² + 18x

Hence  
R₂ = (–128x⁷ + 66x⁶ – 84x + 45)/(–24x⁸ + 12x⁷ – 36x² + 18x),

which is exactly Candidate 1’s factor.

Therefore the two derivative expressions are algebraically identical.

Both candidates give the derivative in the form  

y′ = y · (factor),

where y = √[ x^5 (2x^6+3) / (1−2x)^{1/3} ].

• Candidate 2 writes the factor explicitly as  
  5/(2x) + 6x^5/(2x^6+3) + 1/[3(1−2x)].

• Candidate 1 writes the factor as a single rational expression  
  (−128x^7 + 66x^6 − 84x + 45) / (−24x^8 + 12x^7 − 36x^2 + 18x).

If we put Candidate 2’s sum over the common denominator  
6x(2x^6+3)(1−2x) and combine terms, we obtain exactly  

(−128x^7 + 66x^6 − 84x + 45) / (−24x^8 + 12x^7 − 36x^2 + 18x),

which is the factor written by Candidate 1.

Thus the two derivatives are algebraically identical.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
The question requires four separate answers.  
For each sub-problem, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 must match in both value and unit.

Sub-problem 2 comparison:
• Candidate 1: “11.25 feet by 7.5 feet”  
• Candidate 2: “11.25 in by 7.5 in”

Feet and inches are different units (1 ft = 12 in). Therefore these two answers are not equivalent.  
Since at least one required answer differs, the overall sets of answers are not equivalent.

The question asks for four separate answers.  
Both candidates supply four answers, but they must match in every sub-answer (Rule 2).

Comparison of each sub-answer:

1. 150 miles vs 150 miles → identical.  
2. 11.25 feet by 7.5 feet (Candidate 1) vs 11.25 in by 7.5 in (Candidate 2).  
   • Units differ: feet vs inches.  
   • 11.25 ft ≠ 11.25 in (1 ft = 12 in). Therefore the values are not equivalent (Rule 1).  
3. 8.664 cm vs 8.664 cm → identical.  
4. 8.3 inches vs 8.3 in → identical.

Because sub-answer 2 is not the same, the two overall answer sets are not equivalent.

To compare the two numerical answers we apply Rule 4 (six-significant-digit comparison).

Candidate 1: 2.7181  → 2.71810 (padding to 6 significant digits)  
Candidate 2: 2.718   → 2.71800 (padding to 6 significant digits)

The sequences of six significant digits differ (…810 vs …800), so the two answers are not identical to six significant digits.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give completely different formulas for \(V_1(0,dy)\):

• Candidate 1 involves Gamma functions, an explicit power \(|y|^{\alpha-d}\), and an integral \(\int_0^{|y|^{-2}-1} (u+1)^{-d/2} u^{\alpha/2-1}\,du\).

• Candidate 2 is simply \(\alpha^d(1-y^2)^{d/2}\,dy\).

These expressions are not the same function of \(y,\alpha,d\); there is no straightforward algebraic identity making them equal for all admissible parameters. Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 says the condition is “d ≥ 4”.  
Candidate 2 says the condition is “d ∈ {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}” (i.e. any allowed degree).

The two conditions give different sets of degrees (Candidate 1 excludes 1–3, Candidate 2 includes them), hence the answers are not equivalent.

The two formulas give different values in general.

Example checks:
• n = 3  
  Candidate 1: ⌊3²/4⌋ + 1 = ⌊9/4⌋ + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3  
  Candidate 2: (3² – 3 + 2)/2 = (9 – 3 + 2)/2 = 8/2 = 4

• n = 4  
  Candidate 1: ⌊4²/4⌋ + 1 = ⌊16/4⌋ + 1 = 4 + 1 = 5  
  Candidate 2: (4² – 4 + 2)/2 = (16 – 4 + 2)/2 = 14/2 = 7

Since the outputs differ, the candidates are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 provides a closed-form formula ⌊n²/4⌋ + 1, while Candidate 2 lists the first several terms of a sequence (1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 21, 39, …).  

Comparing the two:

• n = 1: formula → 1; list → 1 (match)  
• n = 2: formula → 2; list → 2 (match)  
• n = 3: formula → 3; list → 3 (match)  
• n = 4: formula → 5; list → 6 (mismatch)

Since they already disagree at n = 4, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two proposed expressions for E[R(𝛤̃)] are structurally very different:

Candidate 1:   
(1/k) · ∏_{w∈V} ( ∑_{α∈E_s(w)} wt(α) )^{k−1}

Candidate 2:   
k · ∑_{w∈V} ∑_{α∈E_s(w)} wt(α)

One is a product of vertex-based sums raised to the power k−1 and scaled by 1/k, while the other is simply k times the total sum of all outgoing-edge weights. Except in very special, non-generic circumstances (e.g., k = 1 and possibly some trivial graphs), these expressions are not equal. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

• Candidate 2:  2^{n−1}

For n = 2, Candidate 1 evaluates to 1.5 (not an integer), whereas Candidate 2 gives 2, so they cannot coincide for all n. Hence the two answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates assert different integral conditions.

Candidate 1 integrand:  \overline{\operatorname{sgn}(f(x))}\,|f(x)|^{p-1} g(x)
  = \overline{f(x)}\,|f(x)|^{p-2} g(x).

Candidate 2 integrand:  |f(x)|^{p-2} f(x) g(x).

Hence:
• For real-valued functions, \overline{f}=f, so the two expressions coincide.  
• For complex-valued functions, they differ by complex conjugation, so “integral = 0” in Candidate 1 is generally a stronger requirement than in Candidate 2 (and different from the usual “Re ∫ … = 0” characterization).

Because the question does not restrict to real functions, the two conditions are not universally the same.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates give different integral expressions.

For real-valued functions one has 
 f |f|^{p-2} = sgn(f)|f|^{p-1} = \overline{sgn(f)}|f|^{p-1}, 
so the two integrals coincide.  

For complex-valued functions, however,  
 f|f|^{p-2} = e^{i\theta}|f|^{p-1}  
whereas  
 \overline{sgn(f)}|f|^{p-1} = e^{-i\theta}|f|^{p-1},  
so the two expressions differ by the factor e^{2i\theta}. Hence, in general they are not equivalent.

Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives, for s = 1,…,k, the probability  
P₁(s)=C(n−s, k−s)/C(n, k−1),  
which depends on n and s.  

Candidate 2 states, for the same range of s, a constant probability  
P₂(s)=1/k,  
independent of n and s.  

These expressions are generally different (except possibly in rare accidental cases).  
For s outside 1…k, both say the probability is 0, but within the main requested range the answers disagree.

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives   P(s) = C(n-s, k-s) / C(n, k-1)  for s = 1,…,k,  
Candidate 2 gives   P(s) = 1/k             for s = 1,…,k.

Except for special coincidences of n and k, these two expressions are not the same function of s; in general C(n-s, k-s)/C(n, k-1) is not a constant in s.  
Both answers agree that the probability is 0 when s is outside 1,…,k, but they disagree on the main probabilities within that range.

Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

The question asks for “the complete list of palindromes …”.  
Both candidates give explicit lists (or partial lists) of such palindromes, so we compare the two lists as sets of sequences.

Candidate 1 lists:  
1, 2, 3, 22, 212, 232, 12321, 32123

Candidate 2 lists (so far):  
[1], [2,1,2] (=212), [3,2,3] (=323), [1,2,1] (=121), [1,1,1] (=111), [2,2,2] (=222), [1,2,3,2,1] (=12321), …

Differences:

• Candidate 1 includes 22, 232, 32123, none of which appear in Candidate 2’s list.  
• Candidate 2 includes 323, 121, 111, 222, which are not in Candidate 1’s list.  
• Candidate 2 also appends an ellipsis “…” implying more items, whereas Candidate 1 presents a finite list declared complete.

Because the two lists are not identical and contain distinct elements, they are not equivalent (Rule 3).

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different polynomial expressions.  
• Candidate 1 contains all six quadratic monomials x², y², z², xy, xz, yz with complicated coefficients that depend on d.  
• Candidate 2 contains only x², y², z² and linear terms x, y, z; it has no xy, xz, yz terms at all and is not even homogeneous.

Since the two expressions differ in both the set of monomials present and the coefficients, they cannot be the same polynomial for general p and d. Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 2: λ(θₙ,₀(E)) = p^{n−1}·[ λ(𝒳(E/ℚ_∞)) + ordₚ(Δ_E) ]

• In Candidate 1, λ(𝒳) is not multiplied by p^{n−1}, while in Candidate 2 it is.  
• The coefficient of ordₚ(Δ_E) in Candidate 1 is (p − 1)/(12)·p^{n−1}; in Candidate 2 it is simply p^{n−1}.  
Because the algebraic expressions differ, they cannot be equivalent.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different formulas for the determinant.

• Candidate 1:  det = ∏_{F ∈ L(M) \ {L₀, ĥ0}} (− t_b_F)^{β(F) w_Σ(M_F)}  (= ∏ (1−b_F²)^{β(F) w_Σ(M_F)}).

• Candidate 2:  det = t_b_F · β(F) · w_Σ(M_F) · dim(L(M)/L₀) · δ(ĥ0).

These are not the same expression: Candidate 2 is not a product over the same index set, and includes completely different extra factors (dim, δ). Hence, by the rules, the answers are inequivalent.

The problem asks for two explicit formulas, one for case (i) and one for case (ii).

Candidate 1 supplies two explicit, concrete expressions involving the quantities requested.

Candidate 2 supplies two different expressions:
• case (i):  bc{…}{k}(n) = #E_m(ν) · bc{…}{1}(ν)  
• case (ii): bc{…}{k}(n) = #Y_m(ν) · bc{…}{1}(ν) + bc{…}{k-1}(μ)

These formulas are structurally and numerically very different from Candidate 1’s. They involve different combinations (products rather than sums) and even introduce bc{…}{k-1}(μ), which is absent in Candidate 1.

Because the two sets of formulas are clearly not the same, the answers are not equivalent.
Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The formulas given by Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are very different.

• Candidate 1 supplies two detailed, additive formulas that depend on m^{k-1}, #E_m, #Y_m, μ, and  bc{t_m}¹(ν).

• Candidate 2 gives only the simple products  #E_m(ν)·bc{t_m}¹(ν)  and  #Y_m(ν)·bc{t_m}¹(ν), with no dependence on m^{k-1} or μ and no additive structure.

Because the structures and values of the two answers do not match for either case, the two candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give different Fibonacci indices for every one of the four requested expressions (Candidate 1 uses 2i-type indices, Candidate 2 uses i-type indices). Because at least one of the expressions differs, the two answer sets are not identical, hence not equivalent.

The question asks for four specific formulas, each involving a Fibonacci index expressed as a function of i.  

Candidate 1 gives indices 2i+1, 2i+2, 2i+2, 2i+3.  
Candidate 2 gives indices 10^i, 10^{i+1}, 10^i, 10^{i+1}.  

These index expressions are clearly different for every i≥0 (e.g., for i=1, 2i+1=3 whereas 10^i=10). Hence every corresponding pair of formulas disagrees.

The question asks for six specific parameters (v, k, λ₁, λ₂, m, n).  
Both candidates supply six values, but the expressions given by Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are completely different:

Candidate 1: 
v = (q^{2e-1}(q^{2e}-1))/(q-1), …, n = q^{2e-1}

Candidate 2: 
v = q^e, …, n = 1

Since at least one of the six parameters differs between the two sets, the answers are not identical and therefore not equivalent.

The two candidates give completely different mathematical expressions.

• Candidate 1 is the infinite q-Pochhammer product  
 (−q^r ; ε q^{r+t+s})_∞ = ∏_{n=0}^{∞} (1 + q^r (ε q^{r+t+s})^{\,n}).

• Candidate 2 is only the finite product  
 (1 + q^{r+t})(1 − ε q^{s}).

The first factor of the infinite product from Candidate 1 is (1 + q^{r}), not (1 + q^{r+t}), and there are infinitely many additional factors not present in Candidate 2. Hence the two expressions cannot coincide for general q, r, t, s, ε (except in very special degenerate cases such as t = 0 and q = 0, which are not the general setting).

Therefore, according to the rules the answers are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas.

Take the smallest even length, n = 2:

• Candidate 1: (n²)/4 + 1 = (4)/4 + 1 = 2  
• Candidate 2: n = 2 = 2·1 ⇒ m = 1 ⇒ 2^m − 1 = 2¹ − 1 = 1

Since 2 ≠ 1, the formulas disagree for n = 2 (and hence in general). Therefore the predictions are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives a piecewise formula:

Candidate 2 gives a different piecewise formula:

For every n except n = 1, the two candidates give different values (e.g., for n = 2 candidate 1 gives 2, candidate 2 gives 0). Therefore the two answers are not equivalent.
The problem asks for seven numerical values.  
Candidate 1 supplies seven distinct numbers, one for each requested quantity.

For the columns:

Candidate 1: nₖ = 2ᵏ n₀ (1 + (k m₀)/(2 n₀))
            = 2ᵏ n₀ + 2ᵏ·(k m₀)/2
            = 2ᵏ n₀ + 2^{k-1} k m₀.

Candidate 2: nₖ = 2^{k-1} (2 n₀ + k m₀)
            = 2^{k-1}·2 n₀ + 2^{k-1} k m₀
            = 2ᵏ n₀ + 2^{k-1} k m₀.

Thus the two formulas for nₖ are algebraically identical. Since both mₖ and nₖ expressions match, the two candidates are equivalent.

2. Candidate 2 places a single coefficient (−1)^l binom{k}{l} in front of one single intersection term (and even leaves S′ undefined).  
   Even if we interpret the missing inner sum implicitly, the numerical coefficients (−1)^{l−1} 2^{l−1} versus (−1)^l binom{k}{l} are not the same for general k, l (e.g., when k>2).

Hence the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two expressions are not equivalent.

A quick counter-example with q = 3:

• Candidate 1 gives  
  P = 3 · (2/3)ᵘ.

• Candidate 2 gives  
  P = (1/3)ᵘ.

Since 3 · (2/3)ᵘ ≠ (1/3)ᵘ for general u, the formulas differ.  
Therefore the candidates are not equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives
P = q / C(q,2) · [ 1 − (1/qᵘ) Σ_{i=0}^{q−2} (−1)ᶦ C(q,i)(q−i)ᵘ ],

After the simplification q/C(q,2)=2/(q−1), it is still a complicated expression that varies with u.

Candidate 2 gives the simple constant expression
P = ((q−2)/q)²,

which is completely independent of u.

Since one answer varies with u while the other does not (and, for example, for q=3, u=1 they give 2 and 1/9 respectively), the two candidates cannot be the same.

Candidate 2 gives 
 ( \overline{ℓ}−\underline{ℓ}+1 )^{\,n−t}.

These expressions have completely different algebraic forms and, for typical parameter choices (e.g., n=1 or n>t), evaluate to different numerical values. Therefore they cannot be considered the same answer.

The question asks for a single numerical/formula answer (maximum size).  
Candidate 1’s answer: n²(q − 1) − n + 2  
Candidate 2’s answer: n(q − 1) + 1  

These two expressions are plainly different for general n and q (e.g., for n = 2, q = 3 they give 2²·2 − 2 + 2 = 8 vs 2·2 + 1 = 5). Therefore the answers are not equivalent.

Both answers express the same quantity once the given relation \(n = 4k\) is taken into account:

• Candidate 1: \(n - 1\)  
• Candidate 2: \(4k - 1\)  (and since \(n = 4k\), \(n - 1 = 4k - 1\)).

Thus the two candidates are equivalent.

The two expressions are

Candidate 1: 1 − η^{3^m}

Candidate 2: 1 − η (1 − e^{−iπ/3})^{2m}

For them to be identical we would need

η^{3^m} = η (1 − e^{−iπ/3})^{2m}  for every η∈[0,1] and every integer m≥1.

The left-hand side depends on η as η^{3^m}, while the right-hand side depends linearly on η and multiplies it by the constant (1 − e^{−iπ/3})^{2m}, which is independent of η. These two functions of η cannot coincide for all η (except trivially at η=0 or perhaps η=1). Hence the candidates give different formulas.

For a probability measure q on a (finite or measurable) alphabet 𝔛, the double integral with respect to dq(x)dq(x′) is exactly the same as the double sum Σ_{x,x'} q_x q_{x'} db(x,x',P). Hence the two expressions are mathematically equivalent.

Candidate 1: ⌈2 √n⌉

Take n = 1 as a quick test case.

Since they already differ for n = 1, the two expressions cannot be equivalent for all integers n.

After factoring, Candidate 1 = p^{ak+b} · [((k–b)/(k+1)) p + (b+1)/(k+1)], whereas Candidate 2 = p^{ak+b} · p^{a}.  
The bracketed factor in Candidate 1 is generally not equal to p^{a} for arbitrary a, b, k, p, so the two expressions are not the same in general.

Therefore, the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different explicit formulas:

For n = 2, these evaluate to
• Candidate 1: 2^{⌊0/4⌋+1}=2

Since they already disagree at n = 2 (and thus cannot be identical for all n ≥ 2), the two answers are not equivalent.
The two candidate expressions are:

Candidate 1: Eₙ = 2^{⌊(n – 2)/4⌋ + 1}  
Candidate 2: Eₙ = 2ⁿ

Candidate 2 is essentially the inside expression used to define k in Candidate 1, but Candidate 1 then multiplies by additional factors (T outside and N K inside the max) and even compares two different terms before taking the ceiling.

The two expressions are not written in the same mathematical form.

Candidate 1:  −4 π i  ( ⃗k / |⃗k|² ) × Ã(⃗k)

Candidate 2:  −(4 π i / ⃗k) × Ã(⃗k)

• Candidate 1 contains the clearly defined factor ⃗k / |⃗k|².  
• Candidate 2 places the entire vector ⃗k in the denominator, i.e. “1/⃗k,” which is not a standard or well-defined vector operation; it is not the same as ⃗k / |⃗k|².

Because the two formulas differ in the way the ⃗k dependence is written, they are not mathematically equivalent.

The two candidates give different formulas:

The two candidates give different explicit formulas:

Candidate 2 gives
  • value = [(m₂ – m₁)/m₂] f(a) when x ≤ a (indicator 1_{a ≥ x}),

Comparing the non-zero cases:

1. Coefficient: ln(m₂/m₁) ≠ (m₂ – m₁)/m₂ for general positive m₁, m₂ (they coincide only in special cases such as m₁ = m₂, which is not assumed).

2. Domain: Candidate 1 uses x < a; Candidate 2 includes x = a. Even if the coefficients matched, the piecewise conditions differ at x = a.

Both implicit equations coincide except for the last term:

• Candidate 1: … + sin(arccos(1 − c))
• Candidate 2: … + √(2c − c²)

For c ∈ (0, 1) let θ = arccos(1 − c).  
Then cos θ = 1 − c ⇒ sin θ = √(1 − cos² θ)  
      = √(1 − (1 − c)²)  
      = √(1 − (1 − 2c + c²))  
      = √(2c − c²).

Hence sin(arccos(1 − c)) = √(2c − c²).

Therefore the two equations are algebraically identical, so the candidates are equivalent.
Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Candidate 1 leads to the equation  

cos θ (π − θ) + sin θ = π⁄2  with θ = arccos(1 − c).

Candidate 2 leads to  

2 (θ − sin θ) = π  ⇔  θ − sin θ = π⁄2  with the same θ.

Comparing the two expressions shows they are not the same functional relation (e.g., a numerical solution of the second gives θ≈2.31 rad, which does not satisfy the first). Therefore the two candidates are not equivalent.

Because candidate 1 includes an additional i Y₀(z) component (and even the exponential factors differ), the two results cannot be identical for general positive a and z. Therefore, the candidates are not equivalent.
The two candidates give fundamentally different expressions for the same integral:

• Candidate 2: I(z) = π e^{z(a − 1)} (a simple exponential with no special functions).

The two expressions can be compared using the reflection formula of the Gamma function.

1. Reflection formula:  Γ(z) Γ(1 − z) = π / sin(πz)

   For z = 1/4:
   Γ(1/4) Γ(3/4) = π / sin(π/4) = π / (√2 / 2) = π√2  
   ⇒ Γ(3/4) = π√2 / Γ(1/4)

2. Substitute into Candidate 2:

   Candidate 2 = (1/4) · Γ(1/4) Γ(1/2) / Γ(3/4)  
   Γ(1/2) = √π, so  
   = (1/4) · Γ(1/4) √π / (π√2 / Γ(1/4))  
   = (1/4) · Γ(1/4)^2 √π / (π√2)  
   = (1/4) · Γ(1/4)^2 / (√2 √π)  
   = Γ(1/4)^2 / (4√(2π))

3. This is exactly Candidate 1:

   Candidate 1 = Γ(1/4)^2 / (4√(2π))

Hence, Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are mathematically equivalent.

Both candidates express the same quantity:

•  Candidate 1 is  
   ln [ (2a+1)^{2a+1} (2b+1)^{2b+1} / (a+b+1)^{2(a+b+1)} ].

•  Taking the natural logarithm of that ratio and using ln(x^k)=k ln x gives  
   (2a+1) ln(2a+1) + (2b+1) ln(2b+1) − 2(a+b+1) ln(a+b+1),

   which is exactly Candidate 2.

Hence the two answers are mathematically identical.

Compute their numerical values (to 6 significant digits):

(ln 2) ≈ 0.693147 → ((ln 2)²)/2 ≈ 0.240227  
ln(5⁄2) ≈ 0.916291 → ½[ln(5⁄2)]² ≈ 0.419794

Candidate 2: 1 / π ≈ 0.318310  

The two numerical values differ significantly (they do not match to six significant digits), so the answers are not equivalent.
The numerical value of Candidate 1 is

whereas Candidate 2 gives 0.04.

Compute their ratio:

= (8n²+8n+3) / [3(2n+1)].

For n = 0 the ratio is 1, but for n = 1 it is 19/9 ≠ 1, so the expressions disagree for general n ≥ 0.

Both candidates give the same symbolic value:

• Candidate 1:  log(3) − 1/4  
• Candidate 2:  ln 3 − 1/4 (enclosed in a box)

In standard mathematical usage—especially in calculus/integration contexts—“log” without a base typically denotes the natural logarithm ln. Candidate 2 explicitly writes “ln”, and Candidate 1 implicitly uses the same base. Hence the two expressions represent the identical number. Therefore, the two answers are equivalent.
Both candidates present the same numeric constant subtracted by 1/4, but differ in the logarithm notation:

• Candidate 1:  log(3) − 1/4  (base of “log” unspecified)
• Candidate 2:  ln 3 − 1/4  (explicitly natural logarithm, base e)

Because the base of “log” in Candidate 1 is not stated, it can reasonably be interpreted as log base 10 (especially given the problem’s heavy use of powers of 10) or as the natural logarithm, whereas Candidate 2 explicitly uses the natural logarithm. This ambiguity means the two answers cannot be confirmed to represent the same value under the comparison rules (Rule 1 on unit/definition ambiguity).

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The two candidates differ in the way they denote the logarithm:

• Candidate 1:  log(3) − 1/4  
• Candidate 2:  ln(3) − 1/4

“ln” is unambiguously the natural logarithm (base e).  
“log” is ambiguous: in many contexts it can mean either natural logarithm or base-10 logarithm, and the problem itself contains powers of 10, so base-10 is a plausible interpretation. Because one candidate’s notation is ambiguous while the other’s is explicit, there is reasonable room for interpreting different bases, which introduces ambiguity in the numerical value.

According to Rule 1, when such ambiguity can change the value, the answers must be regarded as inequivalent.

The question asks for the value of a 2-dimensional vector integral.  

• Candidate 1 supplies the scalar “0”.  
• Candidate 2 supplies the vector “(0, 0)”.  

A scalar zero and a zero vector are different mathematical objects (type mismatch). Hence the two answers are not equivalent.  

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
The integral is of a vector field, so the result should itself be a vector.

• Candidate 1 gives “0”, which is a scalar (its status as a vector is ambiguous).
• Candidate 2 gives “(0, 0)”, explicitly the zero vector in ℝ².

Since one answer is a scalar and the other is a 2-component vector, they are of different types (Rule 6). Therefore they are not equivalent.
The derivative \(Df(0)\) is a linear map \( \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\).

• Candidate 1 explicitly gives that linear map: \(Df(0)(x)=\langle v,x\rangle\).

• Candidate 2 merely writes “\(v\)”, which is a vector, not a linear functional (unless one implicitly identifies \(v\) with the functional \(x\mapsto\langle v,x\rangle\), but that identification is not explicitly made).

Thus the two answers are not the same object, so they are not equivalent.

The two expressions are generally different.

Candidate 1: Γ(z) e^(−iπz / 2)

Candidate 2: Γ(z) i^z = Γ(z) e^{z ln i}.  
With the principal branch, ln i = iπ/2, giving Γ(z) e^{+iπz / 2).

Since e^{−iπz / 2} ≠ e^{+iπz / 2} for a generic complex z (they are complex conjugates when z is real), the two candidates are not equivalent.

The two candidates give different functional expressions for x(t):

• Candidate 1: x(t)= 8^{1/4} cos t  / [1 + (8/a^{4} – 1) e^{–2εt}]^{1/4}

• Candidate 2: x(t)= a cos t

These are equal only in the special case ε = 0; for any positive ε (even very small) they differ. Since the problem specifies 0 < ε ≪ 1, the answers are not equivalent.

Final Judgment: No <End of Judgment>
Both candidates give explicit formulas for x(t), but they are clearly different:

• Candidate 1: x(t)= 8^{1/4} cos t  / [1+(8/a⁴ − 1)e^{−2 ε t}]^{1/4} — amplitude depends on t and ε.
• Candidate 2: x(t)= a cos t — amplitude is constant, independent of t or ε.

Because the two expressions are not mathematically identical for general ε ≠ 0 and general t, they are not equivalent.
Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 give completely different functional forms for x(t):

• Candidate 1: amplitude varies with time through an exponential factor and there is no phase shift.  
• Candidate 2: amplitude is constant (= a) and the only ε-effect is a small phase shift.

These two expressions cannot be transformed into each other for general t and ε; they give different behavior except at t = 0. Hence they are not equivalent.

Both candidates give a single expression for the right-hand semiderivative at a.

• Candidate 1: f′₊(a) = lim_{x→a⁺} f′(x)

• Candidate 2: f′₊(a) = lim_{h→0⁺} [f(a+h) – f(a)] / h

Because the problem states that f′ is continuous on (a,b) and can be continuously extended to a, we have
 lim_{x→a⁺} f′(x) = f′(a).  
By the Mean Value Theorem (or an integral argument), this same value is the limit of the difference quotient:
 lim_{h→0⁺} [f(a+h) – f(a)] / h = f′(a).

Hence, under the given hypotheses, the two limits are equal, so Candidate 1 and Candidate 2 are mathematically equivalent.

Final Judgment: Yes <End of Judgment>
Both candidates provide a single expression for f′₊(a):

• Candidate 1: f′₊(a) = lim_{x→a⁺} f′(x)  
• Candidate 2: f′₊(a) = lim_{h→0⁺} [f(a + h) − f(a)]/h

Under the hypotheses in the problem (f′ is continuous on (a,b) and extends continuously to a), these two limits are equal: the forward difference quotient tends to the same value as the continuous extension of f′ at a. Hence both candidates give the same numerical value for f′₊(a).

Therefore the two answers are equivalent.

Candidate 1 gives  
V₁ = 64 π / 3  ≈ 67.0206

Candidate 2 gives  
V₂ = (64/9)(3 π − 4) = 64 π / 3 − 256/9 ≈ 38.5762

Since V₁ ≠ V₂ (they differ by about 28.44), the two answers are not equivalent.

The two answers give completely different formulas for N.  
Candidate 1 involves an arctangent term, a π-factor, and a rounding operation, whereas Candidate 2 is simply the integral of f′/|f| with no such components. They are plainly not the same mathematical expression, so they cannot be equivalent.
